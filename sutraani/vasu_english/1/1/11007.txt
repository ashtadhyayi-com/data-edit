This defines the word <i>sanyoga</i>. The <i>sûtra</i> consists of three words, हलः, the plural of the <i>pratyåhåra</i> हल्, denoting all the consonants, अनन्तरः means "without any separation or space" and संयोगः which is the word defined, and means "conjunct consonants." So that the <i>sūtra</i> means, conjunct consonants are those consonants between which there is no heterogeneous separating vowel and which are pronounced jointly, such as क्क in the word कुक्कुटः, "cock." The word "<i>sanyoga</i>" applies to the whole of the conjunct consonants jointly and not to them separately. The plural number shows that the conjunction may be of two or more consonants.

Why do we say "consonant"? If two vowels come together they will not be called "sanyoga". Thus तितउच्छत्रं "a sieve umbrella", the two vowels अ and उ have come together unseparated by any consonant; yet they are not called <i>sanyoga</i>, otherwise the final उ would have been rejected by [[8.2.23]] "there is elision of the final of that <i>pada</i> which ends in a <i>sanyoga</i> letter." Why do we say "unseparated by a vowel"? If consonants separated by a vowel were also called <i>sanyoga</i>, then in the sentence पचति पनसम्, the syllable सम् would be called <i>sanyoga</i>, and by [[8.2.29]], the initial स would be elided.
