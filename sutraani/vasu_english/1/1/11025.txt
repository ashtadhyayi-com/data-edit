This <i>sutra</i> enlarges the scope of the definition of षट् by including in it, words formed by डति. By <i>sutra</i> 22, words in डति are already <i>sankhya</i>; by this they are also षट्. Therefore we have कति पठन्ति, 'how many are reading,' कति पश्य 'see how many.' Here कति has lost its plural termination by [[7.1.22]].
