This defines the <i>nishtha</i> affixes, that is to say, the affixes of the past participle. The actual affixes are त, तवत्, the क and उ being indicatory. They being कित् are liable to all the rules applicable to कित् affixes, such as rule (1. 1.5). Thus we have, कृतः, कृतवान्, भुक्तः, भुक्तवान्.

The force of the indicatory उ in <i>ktavatu</i> is, by [[4.1.6]], to indicate that in forming the feminine of nouns ending in an affix having an indicatory vowel of <i>uk</i> <i>pratyahara</i> (उ, ऋ, लृ), the affix ङीप् (ई) must be added. Thus कृतवान् (masc.), कृतवती (fem.). The word <i>nishtha</i> occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.14]].
