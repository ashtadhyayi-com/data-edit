These seven words have already been mentioned in the list of <i>sarvanamas</i>. They are always <i>sarvanamas</i>, when they have the meaning given to them in the list, i. e., when they imply a relation in time and space, but when used in any other sense than the one which has been determined or fixed for them, they are not <i>sarvanamas</i>, nor are they so when they are used as appellatives (संज्ञा). Thus, when the word दक्षिण means 'clever,' it is not a <i>sarvanama</i>, as, दक्षिणा इमे गायकाः 'these clever minstrels,' similarly in उत्तराः कुरवः 'the northern <i>Kurus</i>,' the word उत्तर is not a pronominal, for though it declares a direction, it is a proper noun.

When these seven words are <i>sarvanama</i>, they are declined like <i>sarva</i>, except in the nominative plural, when they may be declined either as <i>sarvanamas</i>, or as ordinary nouns. The option allowed in the case of these words is a <i>praptavibhasa</i>.

That there is a 'specification' (<i>niyama</i>), or tacit implication, of a determinate point (<i>avadhi</i>), with reference to which something is to be described by the word itself, is what we mean when we say "that a relation in time or place (<i>avastha</i>) is implied." For example, if we wish to describe Benares as being southern (<i>dakshina</i>), to do this, we may specify some point, say one of the peaks of the <i>Himalaya</i> with reference to which Benares may be described as a "place to the southward." Again we in the north may thus speak of the people to the south of the <i>Vindhya</i> mountains, as being southern, not with reference to the inhabitants of Ceylon, but with reference (as every one here understands by tacit implication) to us ourselves, who live to the north the <i>Vindhya</i> range. Thus, (पूर्वे or पूर्वाः, अवरे or अवराः, परे or पराः) दक्षिणे or दक्षिणे or दक्षिणाः; उत्तराः; अपरे or अपराः; अधरे or अधराः.
