The word अन्तर when it means बहिर्योग, viz., 'outer' is always <i>sarvanama</i>, so also, when it means उपसंव्यान or 'a lower garment.' Thus, अन्तरे गृहाः or अन्तरा गृहाः 'outer houses, the residence of <i>Chandal</i>, and other low castes.' So अन्तरे or अन्तराः शाटकाः "the inner garments, such as petticoats worn under the upper garments." The word अन्तर when used in the above sense is always <i>sarvanama</i>, but in the nominative plural, it is optionally so. But, when it is not used in the above senses, it is never a <i>sarvanama</i>, e. g., ग्रामयोरंतरे वसति 'he lives between the two villages,' where the regular locative is अन्तरे. With this <i>sutra </i> ends the section on <i>sarvanamas</i>, which began with <i>sutra </i> [[1.1.26]].

Vart:- The word अन्तर when qualifying the word पुरि 'a city,' is not to be treated as a <i>sarvanama</i>, and is, therefore, declined like ordinary nouns. As, अन्तरायां पुरि वसति 'he lives out of the city.'

Vart:- The words formed by the affix तीय such as, द्वितीय and तृतीय, are optionally declined as <i>sarvanama</i> before the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ (ङित्), which are the singular terminations of dative, ablative, genitive and locative, as, द्वितीयस्मै or द्वितीयाय, तृतीयाय or तृतीयस्मै.
