This defines the word <i>samprasarana</i>. It is the name given to the change of semi-vowels into vowels. The <i>pratyahara</i> <i>ik</i> includes the four simple vowels ई, उ, ऋ and लृ, and their corresponding semi-vowels are य्, व्, र्, and ल् included in the <i>pratyahara</i> <i>yan</i>. The word <i>samprasarana</i> is properly the name of the vowel which has replaced the semi-vowel. Thus the past participle of स्वप् 'to sleep,' is formed by adding the <i>nishtha</i> affix क्त (see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.26]]). So that we have स्वप् + त. But there is a rule [[6.1.15]] by which there is samprasarana of the व of स्वप् before the कित् affixes, and we have the form सुप्तः 'slept.' Similarly from वद् - उदितः, यज् - इष्टम्, व्यध् - विद्धः, ग्रह् — गृहीतम् — प्रछ्- पृष्टम्. The term <i>samprasarana</i> is also employed to designate the whole process of the change of the semi-vowels into vowels as in [[6.1.13]]; [[6.4.131]].
