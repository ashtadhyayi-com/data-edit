The rule of substitution by nearness of place applies to the last letter of the word which is exhibited in the genitive case and not to all its letters. Thus by <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.102]], it is declared त्यदादीनामः "in the place of त्यद् &c., there is अ." It does not mean that the whole word त्यद्, is replaced by अ; though at first sight it may appear to mean so; but it means, by virtue of the present explanatory <i>sutra</i>, that the last letter of त्यद्, namely द् is to be replaced by अ.

So also in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.50]] इद्रगोण्याः the short इ replaces only the final letter of गोणी and not the whole word, as पंचगोणिः 'purchased for five <i>gonis</i>.' दशगोणिः
