This <i>sutra</i> is a special exception to the previous aphorism which was too extensive. It declares, that when an affix is elided by using the words लुक्, श्लु, or लुप्, then the 'sign' or लक्षण or the peculiar virtue of the affix also vanishes. Thus there is an important difference in the elision of an affix by force of the words लुप् &c.; and by the word लोप. In one case the virtue of the affix subsists inspite of the elision, in the other it does not.

The word अङ्ग in this <i>sutra</i> requires some explanation. "A root, followed by a suffix (<i>pratyaya</i>), is raised to the dignity of a base (<i>pratipadika</i>), and finally becomes a real word (<i>pada</i>) when it is finished by receiving a case-termination (<i>vibhakti</i>). Every base, with regard to the suffix which is attached to it, is called <i>Anga</i>, body."

Thus the word गर्गाः is the plural of the word गार्ग्यः. The word गार्ग्यः is formed by adding the affix यञ् to गर्ग [[4.1.105]]; the force of the indicatory ञ् being to cause the <i>vriddhi</i> of the first vowel of the word [[7.2.117]]. But in forming the plural of गार्ग्य, rule [[2.4.64]] presents itself, which declares that there is <i>luk</i> of the affix यञ् when the word takes the plural. Here the affix यञ् is elided by the word <i>luk</i>, which means not only the elision of the य of गार्ग्य but also the shortening of आ into अ, that is, the affix being elided, it vanishes altogether, leaving no trace behind, in the shape of the <i>vriddhing</i> of the first vowel, which the affix was competent to cause.

Similarly सृष्टः is the 3rd per. dual present tense of सृज् 'to clean.' It belongs to <i>Adadi</i> class in which the <i>vikarana</i> शप् is elided by '<i>luk</i>' [[2.4.72]]; and hence there is no <i>vriddhi</i> substitution, which would have taken place by [[7.2.114]], (the <i>ik</i> of the base सृज् is <i>vriddhied</i> before verbal affixes).

Similarly जुहुतः 'they two sacrifice'; here the <i>vikarana</i> शप् has been elided by using the word '<i>slu</i>' ([[2.4.75]], let <i>slu</i> be substituted in the room of <i>sap</i> after the verbs <i>hu</i>&c). The effect of this elision is, that there is no <i>guna</i> substitution of the vowel of the base, which शप् was competent to cause.

When an affix is elided in any other way than by the enunciation of the three terms containing लु, it is competent to cause its proper effect. Thus कृ + णिच् + यक् + ते = कारि + यक् + ते = कार् + यक् + ते = कार्यते. Here the elision of the affix <i>nich</i> is by '<i>lopa</i>,' [[6.4.51]] and hence though the affix vanishes, its effect remains. Why do we say 'in respect of an <i>Anga</i> or inflective base?' Observe पञ्च 'five,' सप्त 'seven,' पयः 'milk,' साम '<i>sama</i> <i>veda</i>.' Here in the word <i>pancha</i>, the plural case-affix is elided by (VII. I. 22) (after the words called <i>shat</i>, the जस् and शस् are elided by '<i>luk</i>'). Here the affix is elided by enouncing the word '<i>luk</i>,' the result is, that the affix cannot produce any change which it would otherwise have caused, in the <i>anga</i> or inflective base; such as lengthening, as in <i>rajan</i>, 'a king,' I. p. <i>rajanah</i> 'kings.' But though it is inoperative as regards the <i>anga</i>, the elided affix is not altogether inactive. It retains the virtue of raising the base to the dignity of a <i>pada</i>. Thus:- पंचन् + जस् = पंचन् + ०, (<i>luk</i> [[7.1.22]]). The word <i>panchan</i> is now a <i>pada</i>, and as such, it drops its final न्.
