This <i>sutra </i> defines टि. It is that portion of a word which is included between the last letter and the nearest vowel. Thus in the word अग्निचित् the portion इत् is टि; so also in सामसुत् the portion उत्. The word टि occurs in <i>sutra </i> [[3.4.79]].

The word अचः in the <i>sutra</i> is in the genitive case, which has the force of <i>nirdharana</i> or specification; and though it is in the singular number, it represents class name, meaning 'among the vowels.'
