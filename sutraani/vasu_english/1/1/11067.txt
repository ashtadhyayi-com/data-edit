This <i>sutra</i> explains the force of words in the ablative case when employed in these aphorisms. As the locative case refers to a preceding word, so the ablative refers to a succeeding word.

Thus <i>sutra</i> [[8.4.61]] declares that 'after उद्, of <i>stha</i> and <i>stambha</i>, the substitute is a letter belonging to the class of the prior.' Thus उद् + स्थानम्. Here the word उदः is exhibited in the original <i>sutra</i> in the ablative case, and by the present <i>sutra</i> it means that a dental letter थ् must be substituted in the place of <i>sthana</i>, and by [[1.1.54]] <i>ante</i>, this dental takes the place of स्; we have उद् + थ्थानम् = उत्थ्-थानम्. Similarly in <i>sutra</i> तिङ् ङतिङः[[8.2.18]], 'a word ending in a conjugational affix, when following after a word ending in a non-conjugational affix, becomes <i>anudatta</i>.') Here the word '<i>atinah</i>' is exhibited in the ablative case, therefore, the operation directed by this aphorism, namely, the substitution of <i>anudatta</i> accent, must take place in the word that follows. Thus ओदनं पचति; but not so in पचत्योदनमिति ॥
