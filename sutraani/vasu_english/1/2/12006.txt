 The लिट् (Perfect Tense) affixes after the roots इन्धि 'to kindle' and भू 'to become' are also कित्।
After these two roots the terminations of the Perfect are कित्. These roots have been especially mentioned, because the root इन्धि ending in a compound consonant will not be governed by <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.5]]; and the root भू is mentioned because all the terminations of the Perfect are कित् after भू, not excepting the पित् terminations. Thus the verbs समीधे and ईधे are illustrations of Perfect Tense from the root इन्ध् as in the following examples :- समीधे दस्युहन्तमम्, (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VI. 16. 15), and पुत्र ईधे अथर्वणः, (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VI. 16. 14). Here the nasal of the root is dropped by regarding the affix as कित् ॥ Similarly from the root भू, we have बभूव, वभूविथ ॥

Vart.:- This rule should be applied also to the verbs श्रंथ् 'to loosen,' श्रंथ् 'to fasten,' दंभ् 'to injure' and स्वंज् 'to embrace.' As श्रेथतुः 'thou hast loosened,' श्रंथ + अतुस् = श्रथ् + अतुस्. (The न् is elided by the rule already mentioned in the last <i>sutra</i>, viz. [[6.4.24]].

= श्रथ् + श्रथ् + अतुस् = श्रेथतुः [[6.4.120]], Similarly श्रेथतुः; देभतुः, परिषस्वजे, परिषस्वजाते.
