Thus from भिद् 'to pierce' we have बिभित्सति 'he wishes to break,' here the root भिद् contains the <i>ik</i> vowel इ; it ends in a consonant द्; the affix सन् is directly added without taking an intermediate इ, and therefore it fulfils all the conditions of the <i>sutra</i>; and the vowel is not <i>gunated</i>.

If the final consonant of the verb is not preceded by a vowel of the <i>ik</i> class, the affix सन् is not <i>kit</i> after such a verb. As यज् + सन् + ते = यियक्षते 'wishes to sacrifice.' Had the affix सन् been here a <i>kit</i> affix, there would have been <i>samprasarana</i> by rule [[6.1.16]] which declares that there is <i>samprasarana</i> of the verbs वच्, स्वप्, and यज् &c., before <i>kit</i> affixes. 

If the <i>san</i> takes the intermediate इ and is then no longer a झलादि सन् it is not <i>kit</i>; and causes <i>gunation</i> etcetera. As वृत् + इ + सन् = विवर्तिषते 'he desires to be.' Here there is <i>guna</i> of <i>ri</i>.

Roots like दम्भ्, तृंह् &c., are governed by this rule, though they end in conjunct consonants, for the word हल् of the <i>sutra</i> means <i>jati</i> or class; thus दम्भ् + सन् + तिप् = दभ् + सति [[6.4.24]], the <i>m</i> being elided by treating सन् as कित्) = धीप्सति or धिप्सति [[7.4.56]].
