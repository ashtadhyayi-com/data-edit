 And after the verbs ending in ऋ , the substitutes of लिङ् and the affix सिच् , are कित् , when they begin with झल् and the आत्मनेपद affixes follow.
As from कृ 'to do' the benedictive is कृषीष्ट 'may he do.' So also सिच्, as अकृत 'he did.' So also हृषीष्ट and अहृत.

Of course this rule would not apply if these terminations take the intermediate इ; as वृ + इषीष्ट = वरिषीष्ट 'may he choose,' (Benedictive); अ + वृ + इष्ट = अवरिष्ट or अवरीष्ट 'he chose or covered,' the इ being lengthened by [[7.2.38]].
