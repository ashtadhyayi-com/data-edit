 The सेट् निष्ठा affix and the सेट् क्त्वा are not कित् after the verb पुङ् 'to purify'.
The word 'optionally' of the previous <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.21]] does not govern this <i>sutra</i>, because the word 'optionally' has been again used in the next <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.23]]; of which there would have been no necessity had the word 'optionally' governing force in this <i>sutra</i>, for then this would have also governed the next <i>sutra</i>. The <i>anuvritti</i> of न सेट् however is to be read in this <i>sutra</i>.

By rule [[7.2.51]], after the verb पू the affixes <i>Nishtha</i> and क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> take the intermediate इ. So that क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> being <i>set</i> (by virtue of Rule [[7.2.51]]) would have been non-<i>kit</i> by Rule 18; and it might be asked what is the necessity of repeating it in this <i>sutra</i>, when <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.18]] comprised the case. The reason of this repetition is that by mentioning क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, it has governing force over the succeeding <i>sutras</i>. As पवितः, पवितवान्.
