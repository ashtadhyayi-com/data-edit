 A vowel whose time is that of short उ , ऊ and the prolated ऊ , is called respectively ह्रस्व short, दीर्घ long and प्लुत prolated.
The उ <i>u</i> having one <i>matra</i> or measure is short, having two measures is long, having three measures is <i>pluta</i>. This <i>sutra</i> defines the three kinds of vowels according to their <i>matra</i>. The letter ऊ <i>u</i> has been taken to illustrate the rule. The phrase हृस्वदीर्घप्लुतः is a <i>Dvandva</i> compound, in the Singular, and is exhibited in the masculine gender, contrary to the general rule [[2.4.17]].

The word <i>kala</i> means measure of time required for pronouncing a vowel.

As दधि 'curd', मधु 'honey'. Here इ and उ are short. कुमारी, गौरी, here ई is long. देवदत्ता३ अन्वास <i>Devadatta</i>! Here आ <i>a</i> is <i>pluta</i> or prolated.

These words are used in the following <i>sutras</i>: (1. 2. 47); [[7.4.25]]; [[8.2.82]].
