Of it (स्वरित-s) the first portion is उदात्त , to the extent of a half measure, or prosodial length.
It has been defined that <i>svarita</i> accent is a combination of <i>udatta</i> and <i>anudatta</i>. It remained doubtful what portion was acute and what grave. The present <i>sutra</i> clears up the difficulty, by declaring that in <i>svarita</i>, the first half is accute and the other grave.

The phrase <i>ardhahrasva</i> is used to indicate half the measure of a short vowel. Thus if a short vowel is <i>svarita</i>, its <i>matra</i> being one, half will be <i>udatta</i> and the other half <i>anudatta</i>. If a long vowel, whose <i>matras</i> are two, be <i>svarita</i> then 1/2 will be <i>udatta</i>, 1 1/2 will be <i>anudatta</i>. If a <i>pluta</i> (protracted) vowel be <i>svarita</i>, then first half measure will be <i>udatta</i>, and the remaining 2 1/2measures will be <i>anudatta</i>. In short, the <i>udatta</i> portion of a <i>svarita</i> must not occupy more time than is taken in pronouncing a half short vowel. Thus in शि॒॒क्य॑म् <i>sikyam</i>, the <i>a</i> is <i>svarita</i>, half being acute, the other half grave or monotony; in क॒॒न्या॑ <i>kanya</i>, the long <i>a</i> is <i>svarita</i>, its first half measure is acute, the remaining 1 1/2 is grave; in मानवका॑३ <i>manavaka</i>, here a prolated is <i>svarita</i>, its first 1/2 is acute, the balance 2 1/2 measure is grave.
