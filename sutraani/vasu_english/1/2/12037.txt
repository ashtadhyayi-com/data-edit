The <i>subrahmanya</i> hymns are portions of the <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> mentioned in the <i>satapatha</i> <i>Brahmana</i>.

This <i>sutra</i> prohibits <i>Ekasruti</i> in the case of certain prayers called <i>subrahmanya</i>. By rule [[1.2.34]] read with [[1.2.36]] <i>ante</i>, prayers might be optionally uttered with <i>Ekasruti</i> accent. This ordains an exception to that rule In <i>subrahmanya</i> prayers there is no <i>ekasruti</i>; and in these hymns, a vowel which otherwise by any rule of grammar would have taken a <i>svarita</i> accent, takes an <i>udatta</i> accent instead.

As स॒॒ब्रह्म॒॒ण्यो३ मिन्द्रागच्छ॒॒ हरिव॒॒ आगच्छ॒॒. Here the word सुब्रह्मण्य is formed by the addition of the affix यत् to the word सुब्रह्मण्, and this य will get <i>svarita</i> accent by [[6.1.185]], (तित्स्वरितम्) as it has an indicatory त्; by the present <i>sutra</i>, this nascent <i>svarita</i> is changed into <i>udatta</i>. In the phrase इन्द्र आगच्छ, the word <i>Indra</i> being in the vocative case, इ is <i>udatta</i>, the अ of <i>Indra</i> is <i>anudatta</i> [[6.1.198]] \[1\]. The <i>anudatta</i> preceded by an <i>udatta</i> is changed into <i>svarita</i> [[8.4.66]] \[2\].

Thus the अ of इन्द्र must become <i>svarita</i>, but by the present <i>sutra</i> this nascent <i>svarita</i> is changed into an <i>uddatta</i>. Thus in इन्द्र, both vowels become <i>udatta</i>. In the word आगच्छ, the आ is <i>udatta</i>; the next letter which was <i>anudatta</i> becomes <i>svarita</i>, and from <i>svarita</i> it is changed to <i>udatta</i> by the present rule. Thus in the sentence इन्द्र आगच्छ the first four syllables are all acutely accented, the fifth syllable is only <i>anudatta</i>. So also in हरिव आगच्छ, for the reasons given above, the letters व and च्छ are <i>anudatta</i>, the rest are all acutely accented.
