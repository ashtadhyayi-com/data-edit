The word <i>upasarjana</i> has been defined in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.43]]. In compounds the word गो becomes shortened when it stands last and is an <i>upasarjana</i>.

Thus चित्र + गो = चित्रगुः 'possessed of a brindled cow.' This is an example of a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> or possessive compound. So also शबलगु 'a spotted cow.' Similarly in those <i>pratipadika</i> <i>upasarjanas</i> which end in feminine suffixes having a final long vowel, there is a shortening. Thus निः + कौशाम्बी = निष्कौशाम्बिः. Here the final long ई is shortened. So also निर्वाराणसिः.

The word <i>pratipadika</i> of the previous <i>sutra</i> is understood in this. The word गो in the <i>sutra</i> means the form गो and not other words synonym with it. The word स्त्री means "a word ending in a feminine affix," because it has the <i>svarita</i> accent. The word <i>upasarjana</i> qualifies both these words, i. e. when गो is an <i>upasarjana</i> and when a word having a feminine termination is an <i>upasarjana</i>.

Other examples are:- अति + खट्वा = अतिखट्वः 'without a bed-stead' अतिमालः 'surpassing a necklace in beauty.'

If such a word is not an <i>upasarjana</i>, there is no shortening, as, राजकुमारी 'the king's daughter.' Here the word राजन् is <i>upasarjana</i>, and not the word कुमारी which latter is therefore not shortened. The word must be a derivative word formed by the addition of an affix, which makes it feminine. Thus the words लक्ष्मी, श्री &c. are feminine originally, and are not derived from the masculine nouns, by the addition of any feminine affix. Therefore we have अतिलक्ष्मीः 'surpassing <i>Lakshmi</i> in beauty', अतिश्रीः ॥

Vart :- In <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds, exception must be made of feminine nouns ending in the affix ईयसी, as बहुश्रेयसी, विद्यमानश्रेयसी ।
