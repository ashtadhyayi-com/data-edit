The word लुक् defined in <i>sutra</i> 61, Chapter I, is twice used in this <i>sutra</i>. Where a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is elided by the word लुक्, there the feminine suffix of the <i>pratipadika</i> is also dropped, or becomes <i>luk</i>. Thus there are certain <i>Taddhita</i> suffixes by which patronymics are formed (one of them being अण्) from other nouns. Before this अण् the initial vowel of the word is <i>vriddhied</i> and the final is <i>gunated</i>. Thus सिन्धु 'ocean', forms सिन्धु + अण् = सैन्धो + अ = सैन्धव 'born in ocean or oceanic.' But there are certain words, e. g. श्रविष्ठा, फल्गुणी &c., which are all feminine gender (see <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.34]] \[1\] after which the patronymic suffix is totally elided, without leaving any trace of its action, by using the word <i>luk</i>. Thus श्रविष्ठा + (अण्लुक्) = श्राविश्ठः ॥ Here then the present <i>sutra</i> finds its scope. The <i>Taddhita</i> suffix being <i>luked</i>; the original feminine termination आ also becomes <i>luk</i>. Therefore the 'patronymic derivative of श्रविष्ठा (is not a longer word, as might have been expected) but actually a shorter word, namely श्रविष्ठः; similarly from फल्गुनी if we have फल्गुनः &c.

Thus there is a feminine suffix called ङीष् (actually ई) and certain words like इन्द्र &c., [[4.1.49]] \[2\] take an additional suffix called आनुक् (actually आन्). Thus the feminine of इन्द्र will be इन्द्र + आनुक् + ङीष् = इन्द्र + आन् + ई = इन्द्राणी. Now in forming <i>Dvigu</i> compound (Numeral Determinative compound), the <i>Taddhita</i> suffixes are dropped. Thus पंचकपालः 'an offering (<i>purodash</i>) made in a dish with five compartments.' In this compound the <i>Taddhita</i> suffix अण् is dropped. Otherwise the form would have been कापालः ॥ Similarly when the word इन्द्राणी forms a <i>Dvigu</i> compound, the <i>Taddhita</i> suffixes are dropped. But not only that, even the original radical affixes are also dropped by force of the present <i>sutra</i>. Thus पंचेन्द्रः which means the cake sacred to the five goddesses इन्द्राणी. Here the full form was पंच + इन्द्राणी + अण्. (The suffix अण् has the force of "sacred to God." Thus इन्द्र + अण् = ऐन्द्रं To sacred to God <i>Indra</i>). In the above expression, first the <i>Taddhita</i> suffix अण् is <i>luked</i> by rule contained in <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.88]] \[3\] relating to <i>Dvigu</i> compounds: we have the remaining पंच + इन्द्राणी. In this stage, the present <i>sutra</i> comes into force and declares that where a <i>Taddhita</i> suffix has been <i>luked</i>, the final feminine suffixes of the <i>upasarjana</i> <i>pratipadika</i> are also <i>luked</i>. Therefore, the feminine suffixes आनुक् and ङीष् are also dropped, and we have पंचेन्द्रः which means "cake sacred to the five <i>Indranis</i> (goddesses)."

The word स्त्री and <i>upasarjana</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> are understood in this. By the last <i>sutra</i>, a word ending in a feminine affix was told to be shortened when it was an <i>upasarjana</i>; this <i>sutra</i> teaches the total suppression of such an affix in special cases. To take another example: Thus Rule [[4.3.163]] declares फलेलुक् "<i>luk</i> takes the place of an affix signifying modification or product when fruit is meant." Thus यत् is an affix which means modification. Thus गो + यत् = गव्यम् 'cow's milk or the product of cow.' This affix is suppressed when applied to a tree, in the sense of the fruit of the tree. Thus the fruit of the tree आमलकी will be called आमलकं, i. e. first the <i>Taddhita</i> affix is <i>luked</i>, and then the feminine affix is also dropped. Similarly fruits of वदरी or बकुली trees are बदरं or बकुलं.

This rule only applies when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is elided; and not so when any other affix is <i>luked</i>. Thus गार्ग्याः + कुलं = गार्गीकुलम् 'the family of <i>Gargi</i>.' Here in forming the <i>samasa</i>, the case affix of the word <i>gargi</i> is <i>luked</i> by [[2.4.71]] \[3\]. But this suppression of the genitive termination does not necessitate the elision of the feminine affix ई of <i>gargi</i>.

This rule would not also apply if there is no elision by <i>luk</i> of a <i>Taddhita</i> affix, as in गार्गीत्वम्.

Nor will the rule apply when the word is not an <i>upasarjana</i>. As अवन्ती, कुन्ती, कुरूः.
