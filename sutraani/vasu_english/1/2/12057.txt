Here <i>Panini</i> controverts the opinion of those grammarians who would even define time and sequence. Thus there were authors who defined pluperfect as a tense relating to time hundred years past, others said a thousand years past, &c. <i>Panini</i> declares that these are redundant definitions and reprehensible, for the same reason as given in the previous <i>sutra</i>.

To give another example. Thus अद्यतनः कालः or the period of the current day, has been thus defined by some <i>Acharyas</i>:- "The period of time beginning from the point when one rises (or ought to rise) from his bed, according to the law, and ending with the point when one goes to bed, according to rule, is called <i>adyatana</i>." Others say "from midnight to midnight is the period of the current day." Similarly others have explained the '<i>upasarjana</i>' to mean "that which is not the principal word in a compound is called <i>upasarjana</i>." The sage <i>Panini</i> has not thought it worth his while to define such word as <i>upasarjana</i>, in as much as their sense is well understood by all as a matter of usage. Thus common people who have never heard of grammar, also know the correct use of tenses; they say: "This is to be done by me to-day, this wiil be done by us to-morrow, this was done by us yesterday."

Similarly common people also know the use of the word <i>upasarjana</i>, for they say:- "वयमत्र गृहे ग्रामे वा उपसर्जनम्" 'we are secondary or unimportant persons in this house or village,' meaning that they are not the principal persons. Therefore that which is valid according to the usage of the people is needless to be taught.

Why was not this <i>sutra</i> included in the last? What is the necessity of making a separate rule of this? The answer is that it is an illustrative <i>sutra</i>, and does not exhaust the subject. There are other rules made by former sages which are also not taught by <i>Panini</i>. Thus the following rules of old <i>Rishis</i> are not taught herein, they being supposed to be well-known. "A <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound connotes ownership." "In <i>Dvanda</i> compounds the sense of both the members of a compound are principal" "In <i>Avyayibhava</i> compounds the sense of the prior word is the principal" &c.
