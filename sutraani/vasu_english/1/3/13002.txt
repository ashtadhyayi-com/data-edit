<i>Anunasika</i> or nasalized vowels are इत् that is indicatory, when occurring in technical words. Thus in क्विन्, विद्, विच् the <i>anunasika</i> इ is इत्. The original <i>sutra</i> contains the word '<i>upadesa</i>' which we have translated as technical term. '<i>Upadesa</i>' literally means 'instruction' or the first mentioning of a thing either in a <i>sutrapatha</i>, or <i>ganapatha</i>, or <i>dhatu</i> <i>patha</i>, &c.

From this <i>sutra</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.9]], there is a description of servile or indicatory letters called इत्. "In <i>Panini</i>'s Grammar there is no visible sign of the nasality of a vowel -- hence we can know a vowel to be nasalized only from <i>Panini</i>'s explicitly asserting that it is so, or from our finding that he treats it in such a way that we must conclude he regarded it as nasal." An <i>upadesa</i> is defined as signifying an original enunciation, that is to say, an affix (<i>pratyaya</i>), or an augment (<i>agama</i>), or a verbal root (<i>dhatu</i>), or in short, any form of expression which occurs only in technical treatises of grammar, and which is not a word ready for use, but one of the supposed original elements of a word. Thus in the root एध 'to increase,' the final अ is indicatory, the real root is एध्. So also the final अ of स्पर्द्ध is इत् ॥

If the word is not an <i>upadesa</i>, then the nasal vowel is not इत् ॥ As अभ्र आं अपः ॥ A word may be an <i>upadesa</i>, and nasal, but if it is not a vowel, it need not be इत् as the affix मनिन् in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.74]]. (आतो मनिन् क्वनिब् वनिपश्च) It is only the nasal vowel of an <i>upadesa</i> that becomes इत् and not all the vowels. The word इत् occurs in <i>sutras</i> [[5.2.16]]. (आदितश्च &c.).
