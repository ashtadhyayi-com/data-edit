The word '<i>atmanepada</i>' here governs all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.77]] inclusive, and is understood in them all; and will not therefore be repeated. Thus of the verb आस the final अ is <i>anudatta</i> and is इत्. It is therefore an <i>atmanepadi</i> verb. As अस्ति. So षूङ्—सूते, शीङ् शेते.
