The active or कर्तृवाच्य verbs when denoting reciprocal action are <i>atmanepadi</i>. As, व्यतिपचन्ते, 'they cook for each other,' व्यतिलुनते 'he performs cutting of wood which was the appropriate office of another.'

The words "reciprocity or interchange of action" of this <i>sutra</i> govern and are understood in the two following <i>sutras</i> also.

The word <i>karma</i> in the <i>sutra</i> means action and not the technical '<i>karma</i>' meaning 'object' and the word <i>vyatihara</i> means reciprocity or interchange. When an action which was appropriate to one person is performed by another, whose duty it was not, that is called 'interchange of action.' When such interchange is not meant <i>Paras</i>. is used. As लुनन्ति 'they cut.' The word <i>kartari</i> here is used for the sake of the subsequent aphorism [[1.3.78]], which see.
