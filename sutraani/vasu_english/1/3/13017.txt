As विशति 'he enters, but निविशते 'he enters in.'

Even when the augment अट् of the imperfect, Aorist and Conditional tenses intervenes between the root and the preposition, terminations are of the <i>atmanepada</i>. As न्यविशत 'he entered in.'

The नि of the <i>sutra</i> must be an <i>upasarga</i>, because that has a sense, and not any नि. On this there is this <i>paribhasha</i>:-अर्थवद्ग्रहणेनानर्थकस्य "a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning." Thus in मधुनि विशन्ति भ्रमराः 'the beetles enter the honey flowers." Here the नि is a part of the word मधुनि and has no sense by itself, and therefore the verb is in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> and not in the <i>Atmanepada</i>.
