This <i>sutra</i> is commenced to show that <i>kri</i> may take the <i>atmanepada</i> affix even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word <i>prasahana</i> means 'to overcome, to be not defeated,' As तमधिचक्रे 'he overcame him or he was not defeated by him.'

Why do we say, 'in the sense of to overcome?' Witness अर्थमधिकरोति 'he learns the meaning' in which example the <i>atmanepada</i> affix is not employed.

The necessity of making a separate <i>sutra</i> of this rule, instead of including it in the last aphorism, arose with the object of giving a distinctive meaning to the prefix <i>adhi</i>.
