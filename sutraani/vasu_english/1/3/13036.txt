This <i>sutra</i> is begun in order to show that the verb नी may take the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i>, even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, in the following cases, viz, when it means to 'respect' &c.

<i>Sammanana</i> means to respect; as नयते चर्वी लोकायते 'the <i>Charvi</i> gives instruction in the <i>Lokayata</i> <i>sastra</i>.' The word <i>charvi</i> primarily means intelligence, and by secondary use it has been extended to the preceptor also; such a preceptor gives instruction, in <i>Lokayata</i> <i>Sastra</i>, that is to say, having established the truth of the doctrines of that philosophy by argumentation, imparts them to the pupils. Those doctrines being thus established by reason, become respected (<i>Sanmanita</i>) and honored.

<i>Utsanjana</i>, 'to throw up, or lift up,' as माणवकमुदानयते 'he lifts up <i>Manavaka</i>.'

<i>Acharya</i>-<i>karana</i> 'acting as a teacher,' that is to say, to bring a boy near oneself in such a way, that being so brought near (<i>upa</i>-<i>neta</i>), he may himself become an <i>acharya</i>, As माणवकमुपनयते 'he initiates <i>Manavaka</i> (i.e., making himself the preceptor he brings the boy near himself.')

<i>Jnana</i> means 'knowledge, a demonstrated verity.' As नयते चर्वीलोकायते 'the <i>Charvi</i> investigates the truth of the <i>Lokayata</i> doctrine.'

<i>Bhriti</i> means 'wages.' As कर्मकारानुपनयते 'he employs the servants on hire or wages.'

<i>Viganana</i> means the paying off as a tribute, debts &c. As मद्रा करं विनयन्ते, the <i>Madras</i> pay the tax due to the king, that is, they discharge the debt.'

<i>Vyaya</i> means 'allotment of money on works of merit &c.' As शतं विनयते 'he expends a hundred pieces on religious acts.' सहस्रं विनयते 'he devotes a thousand.

Why do we say, in these senses? Witness अजां नयति ग्रामम् 'he carries the goat to the village.' Here there is no <i>Atmanepada</i> affix, as the verb has not any one of the above significations.
