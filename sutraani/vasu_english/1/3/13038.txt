The word '<i>kram</i>' governs the succeeding <i>sutras</i> up to [[1.3.43]] and is understood in them all.

The verb <i>kram</i> by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.78]] (after the rest, let the <i>parasmaipada</i> affixes be employed in marking the agent), would have taken the affixes of the <i>parasmaipada</i>; the present aphorism enjoins <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes in certain cases when the verb means to have a taste for &c.

<i>Vritti</i> 'continuity' means unobstructed, or want of interruption (i. e., a taste for, or facility in, anything), <i>sarga</i> 'energy' means application, resolution and determination. <i>Tayana</i> 'development' means increase and growth.

As (1) ऋक्ष्वस्य क्रमते बुद्धिः - 'his reason proceeds unobstructed through the <i>Rig</i>. scriptures i. e., he can easily comprehend the <i>Rig</i>.' (2). व्याकरणाध्ययनाय क्रमते 'the pupil shows energy or exerts to study the grammar.' (3). अस्मिनशास्त्राणि क्रमन्ते 'the <i>shastras</i> are developed in him.'

Why in these senses only? Witness अपक्रामति 'he runs away.'
