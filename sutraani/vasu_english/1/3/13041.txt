As वाजी विक्रमते 'the horse is pacing.' The term <i>vikramana</i> is applied to the special movements of horse &c.

Though in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> (catalogue of verbal roots), the verb क्रमि and क्रमु have the meanings of <i>pada</i>-<i>viharana</i> and <i>pada</i>-<i>vikshepa</i>, that is "throwing or placing of foot," and so it might be objected that the present <i>sutra</i> is a useless repetition, yet as verbs have various other meanings than what is assigned to them in the <i>dhatupatha</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> is not unnecessary.

Why do we say "in the sense of throwing of foot"? In any other sense, the terminations will be those of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As विक्रामति अजिनसन्धिः 'the fold of the antilope skin is ruptured.'
