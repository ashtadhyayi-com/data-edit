As सर्पिषो जानीते मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice by means of clarified butter or honey.' (See [[2.3.51]]).

This <i>Atmanepadi</i> form of <i>jna</i> is employed when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. From <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.76]] it will be seen that when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the verb is <i>Atmanepadi</i>.

How in the above example the verb <i>jna</i> is intransitive? Because the word <i>sarpih</i> is not the object of knowledge, but it is an instrument of sacrifice, into which one engages from complete knowledge (<i>jnana</i>); and it (<i>sarpishah</i>) is in the genitive case by virtue of [[2.3.51]] (ज्ञोऽविदर्थस्य करणे) by which the instrumental <i>karaka</i> of the <i>jna</i> is put in the genitive case.

Why do we say of "Intransitive"? Because in the transitive it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>, as स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he knows (recognizes) the son by his voice.'
