By <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.78]], <i>vad</i> generally takes the terminations of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. By the present <i>sutra</i>, it takes also the affixes of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when having certain meanings.

<i>Bhasana</i>, (shining) means to illumine as वदते चर्वी लोकायते. The <i>charvi</i> illumines the <i>Lokayat</i> <i>shastras</i>, by his discourses and clear exposition.

<i>Upasambhasha</i> (persuasions) means to appease, to conciliate, as कर्मकरानुपवदते 'he conciliates or cajoles the servants.'

<i>jnana</i> (knowledge) means to know completely, as वदते चर्वी लोकायते 'the <i>charvi</i> knows completely to discourse upon <i>Lokayat</i> <i>shastra</i>.'

<i>Yatna</i> (endeavour) means energy, as क्षेत्रे वदते 'He toils in the field,' गेहे वदते 'he toils in the house.'

<i>Vimati</i> (disagreement) means dissension, want of unanimus opinion As क्षेत्रे विवदन्ते, 'they disagree over the field,' i.e., holding different opinions they talk diversely.

<i>Upamantrana</i> (enticing) means to coax in secret, as, कुलभार्यामुपवदते 'he entices the wife of a respectable family (i.e., seduces her in secret),' परदारानुपवदते 'he flatters another's wife.'

Why in the above senses only? See यत् किंचिद्वदति 'he says something'.
