As संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः 'the <i>Brahmanas</i> are speaking.' But in संप्रवदन्ति कुक्कुटाः 'the cocks are crowing' it is properly <i>Parasmaipadi</i>.

The sense of the <i>sutra</i> is that when men, who are only capable of articulate speech, speak all in one and the same time, then the verb <i>vad</i> takes the affix of the <i>Atmanepada</i>. When lower animals make a chorus of noise, the verb does not take the <i>Atmanepada</i>

There must be <i>samuchcharana</i> for the application of this rule; when there is no <i>samuchcharana</i> or speaking in a chorus, this rule does not apply, as ब्राह्मणो वदति 'the <i>Brahmana</i> speaks.'
