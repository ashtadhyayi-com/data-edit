After the verb गॄ 'to swallow', when preceded by अव, the आत्मनेपद is used.
As अवगिरति (he swallows). The root <i>gri</i> to swallow preceded by the preposition <i>ava</i> is <i>Atmanepadi</i>. The verb <i>gri</i> taken in this <i>sutra</i> means to swallow and belongs to the <i>Tudadi</i> class. It is not the <i>gri</i> 'to make sound' which belongs to the <i>kryadi</i> class, because there is no word formed with the latter verb by affixing the preposition <i>ava</i> to it. By <i>sutra</i> (I. .3. 78) this verb <i>gri</i> 'to swallow' would have been <i>Parasmaipadi</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> debars that.

When it is not preceded by <i>ava</i>, it is <i>Parasmaipadi</i>, as गिरति 'he swallows.'
