This is a restrictive <i>sutra</i>, the root मृङ् (to die), is marked with a ङ् as an indicatory letter; so by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] it would be always <i>Atmanepadi</i>. But the present aphorism restricts it to लुङ् <i>lun</i> (Aorist) and लिङ <i>lin</i> (Benedictive) tenses as well as to those tenses which are शित्. It will be found hereafter that out of the ten tenses, those that take शित् affixes are the special tenses, i. e., the Present, the Imperfect, the Potential and the Imperative.

It is only before these three affixes, namely, <i>lin</i>, <i>lun</i>, and <i>sit</i> affixes, that the root <i>mri</i> takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus the aorist अमृत <i>amrita</i> he died; Benedictive मृषीष्ट <i>mrishishta</i> 'may he die.' Similarly before <i>sit</i> affixes : thus म्रियते 'he dies,' = भृ + श + ते [[7.4.28]] रिङ् शयग्लिङ् क्षु) म्रिय + अ + ते = म्रियते [[6.4.77]]. अचि श्नुधातुभ्रुंवां य्वोरियङुवङौ) म्रियेते, म्रियन्ते The root मृ belongs to the sixth class of verbs called <i>Tudadi</i> which take the <i>vikarana</i> श in the conjugational tenses [[3.1.77]].

In other tenses, viz., the two Futures, the Perfect and the conditional, this verb is <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As मरिष्यति he will die. अमरिष्यत्.
