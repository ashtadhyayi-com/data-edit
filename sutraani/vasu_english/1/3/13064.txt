The verb युजिर् 'to join' is <i>svaritet</i>, and consequently by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it is always <i>atmanepadi</i>, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present <i>sutra</i> declares when this verb may take the terminations of <i>atmanepada</i>, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. After the verb युज् preceded by the prepositions  प्र and उप the terminations are of the <i>atmanepada</i>, when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels. As प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he joins or employs'; उपयुङ्क्ते 'he fits or uses.'

Why do we say "when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels?" Because there the terminations will be of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As द्वन्द्वं न्यञ्चि पात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति.

Vartika:- It shall be rather stated that the root takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when preceded by any preposition beginning or ending with a vowel. This is an important modification of the above rule. Thus उद्युङ्क्ते and नियुङ्क्ते. In fact, all <i>upasargas</i>, with the exception of सम्, निर्, and दुर्, either begin or end with a vowel, and therefore the <i>Vartika</i> amounts to the inclusion of all prepositions with the above exception.

With सम्, निर् and दुर्, however, the root will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations; as संयुनक्ति.
