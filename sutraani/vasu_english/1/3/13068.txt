The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is understood in this <i>sutra</i> and is to be supplied from the previous aphorism. This <i>sutra</i> is also restricted to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word हेतु in the aphorism has been defined later on in <i>sutra</i> [[1.4.55]] (स्वतन्त्र कर्त्ता); it is the agent which is the mover of another's agent. When a fear is caused by a हेतु it is called हेतुभय. The word भय 'fear' in the aphorism is illustrative, and includes by implication विस्मय 'astonishment' also. As जटिलो भीषयते 'the <i>jatila</i>, the cock-headed frightens.' मुण्डो भीषयते 'the <i>munda</i>, the shave-headed frightens '; जटिलो विस्मापयते 'the <i>jatila</i> astonishes,' मुण्डो विस्मापयते 'the <i>munda</i> astonishes' i.e., the very fact of matted-hair or shaven-head frightens,' &c.

Why do we say हेतुभय? For if the fear or astonishment is not the direct result caused by the agent, but arises from something else, then the <i>atmanepada</i> will not be used. As कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति 'he frightens him with the <i>kunchika</i>,' रूपेण विस्माययति 'he astonishes with his form'. Here <i>kunchika</i> and <i>rupa</i> are the instruments, which cause fear or astonishment, and are not the <i>hetu</i> thereof.
