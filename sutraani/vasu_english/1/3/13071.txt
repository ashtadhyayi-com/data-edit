The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. The aphorism is restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word <i>abhyasa</i> means doing again, or repetition; as पदं मिथ्या कारयति means 'he repeatedly pronounces the word incorrectly, that is with wrong accent, &c., not once but constantly'.

Why do we say 'when the word <i>mithya</i> is used as an <i>upapada</i>?' The causative of <i>kri</i> will take <i>parasmaipada</i> when it has any other <i>upapada</i>. Thus पदं सुष्टुम् कारयति 'he pronounces the word correctly.'

Why do we say 'of the verb कृञ्? Because the causative of any other verb used along with the word <i>mithya</i> will not have <i>atmanepada</i>; as पदं मिथ्या वाचयति 'he repeatedly utters the word wrongly.' Here वच् takes <i>parasmaipada</i>.

Why do we say 'repeatedly'? For if the incorrect utterance is not habitual, then <i>parasmaipada</i> will be used; as पदं मिथ्याकारयति 'he pronounces wrongly, not always but once.'
