The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is read into this aphorism by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. As ब्रीहीन् संयच्छते 'he gathers rice'; भारमुद्यच्छते 'he lifts up the load'; वस्त्रमायच्छते 'he draws out the cloth.' The root <i>yam</i> preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> by virtue of aphorism [[1.3.28]] <i>ante</i>; but in that aphorism the verb was intransitive, here it is transitive, and this explains the necessity of making two different <i>sutras</i> for one compound verb आयम्.

Why do we say 'when it does not refer to a book.' For otherwise the verb will take the terminations of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As उद्यच्छति चिकित्सां वैद्यः 'the physician diligently studies medicine.'

When however the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the above compound verbs are <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As संयच्छति, उद्यच्छति, आयच्छति.
