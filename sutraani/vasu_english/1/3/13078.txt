The rules of <i>Atmanepada</i> have been declared in the preceding 66 <i>sutras</i>, [[1.3.12]] to [[1.3.77]]. The terminations of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, which are the general verbal terminations, will come everywhere else, that is to say, where its operation is not debarred by any one of the preceding aphorisms. The present <i>sutra</i> declares this universal rule. The word <i>sesha</i> or the rest, means that which is the residue after the application of all the previous restrictive rules. Thus it was declared by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] <i>ante</i> that a root having an <i>Anudatta</i> vowel or a ङ as <i>it</i>, will take <i>Atmanepada</i> termisations. As आस्ते शेते. The converse of this will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations, namely all verbs which do not have an <i>anudatta</i> accent or a ङ as <i>it</i>. Thus याति 'he goes,' वाति 'it blows.' It has been declared by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.17]] that the root विश when preceded by नि takes <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations, as निविशते. When not preceded by नि but any other preposition, it will take the <i>parasmaipada</i> termination. As आविशति, प्रविशति.

Why do we say "when marking the agent"? For when used in the passive voice the root will take the <i>Atmanepada</i> termination. As पच्यते 'it is cooked', गम्यते 'it is gone.'

Why is not <i>parasmaipada</i> used when the verb is employed reflexively ? As in the following example :- पच्यते ओदनः स्वयमेव 'the food cooks of itself.' Because in the present <i>sutra</i> the word कर्तरि of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.14]] <i>ante</i> is to be read in by <i>anuvritti</i>, so that, in fact there are two कर्तरि in this aphorism which thus means "when the agent of the verb is an agent pure and simple then <i>parasmaipada</i> is employed." While when a verb is used reflexively (कर्म्मकर्तरि) the agent of the verb is also, in one aspect, the object of the verb; and it is therefore, that in reflexive verbs the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations are employed.
