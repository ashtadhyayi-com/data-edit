The phrase 'when used in the causative (णेः) of the last <i>sutra</i> is to be read into this also. The <i>parasmaipada</i> is ordained as an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]] by which <i>atmanepada</i> was ordained when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. The word निगरणं means 'eating,' and चलनं means 'moving,' 'shaking.' As निगारयति he causes to swallow; आशयति he causes to eat; भोजयति he feasts; चलयति he moves; चोपयति, कम्पयति he shakens. This aphorism applies to transitive verbs, and to verbs whose agents in non-causative state are inanimate objects, i. e. not possessed with reason.

Vart:- The prohibition of the root अद to eat, must be mentioned. The causative of अद to eat, takes <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus अत्ति देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i> eats; आदयते देवदत्तेन he is made to eat by <i>Devadatta</i>.
