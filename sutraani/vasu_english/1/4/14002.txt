When rules of equal force prohibit each other then the last in the order herein given is to take effect.
The word विप्रतिषेधे means 'opposition of rules of equal force.' When two topics having different objects in view find scope of action simultaneously in one particular case, that opposition of equal forces is called <i>vipratishedha</i>. A general rule (<i>utsarga</i>) and its exception (<i>upavada</i>), or an invariable (<i>nitya</i>) and an optional (<i>anitya</i>) rule, or an <i>antaranga</i> and a <i>bahiranga</i> rule, are not rules of equal force. There the stronger prevails against the weaker. As an example of rules of equal force, see (VII. 3.102.) and [[7.3.103]]. The first rule declares, 'when a case-affix beginning with a letter of <i>yan</i> <i>pratyahara</i> follows, the long vowel is substituted for the final of an inflective base ending in a short अ.' As <i>Vriksha</i> + <i>bhyam</i> = <i>Vrikshabhyam</i>. The next rule declares :- When a plural case-affix beginning with a letter or <i>jhal</i> <i>pratyahara</i> follows, ए is the substitute for the final short अ of an inflective base.' As <i>Vriksha</i> + <i>su</i> = <i>Vriksheshu</i>. But when the plural case-affix <i>bhyah</i> follows, what rule are we to apply? For the letter <i>bha</i> belongs both to the <i>pratyaharas</i> <i>yan</i> and <i>jhal</i>. Are we to lengthen the short अ, or substitute ए? The present <i>sutra</i> gives the reply, ए is to be substituted because [[7.3.103]] ordaining ए follows next to [[7.3.102]]. Thus <i>Vriksha</i> + <i>bhyah</i> = <i>Vrikshebyah</i>.
