This is clear the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word conjunct is not understood in this <i>sutra</i>. As <i>i</i> of ईहांचक्रे he endeavoured, ईक्षांचक्रे he saw. Here the letter ई is <i>guru</i>, and because of its being called <i>guru</i>, the rule [[3.1.36]] is applied in forming the perfect tense by the addition of the augment आस्. Thus all long vowels, and short vowels followed by conjunct consonants are <i>guru</i> or heavy. All other short vowels are <i>laghu</i>.
