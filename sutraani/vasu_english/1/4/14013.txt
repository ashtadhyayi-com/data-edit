After whatsoever there is an affix enjoined, whether verbal or crude-form, that which begins therewith in the form in which it appears when the affix follows it, is called an अङ्ग 'Inflective base'.
The words of this <i>sutra</i> require some explanation. <i>Yasmat</i> after whatsoever; <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>vidhih</i> compound of <i>pratyaya</i> meaning an affix and <i>vidhih</i>, a precept i.e. a rule enjoying an affix; <i>tadadi</i>, I. S. that which begins therewith <i>pratyaye</i> 7. S. = in a <i>pratyaya</i> i.e. when a <i>pratyaya</i> follows (1. 1.) is called a base.

After whatsoever there is an affix enjoined, whether it be a verbal root (<i>Dhatu</i>) or a nominal base (<i>pratipadika</i>), the word-form having that as its beginning, is called an <i>anga</i>, with regard to the affix that follows. The word <i>yasmat</i> is used in the aphorism to point out the thing named, as <i>anga</i>; because the word <i>tadadi</i> follows it. This defines the word <i>anga</i>. The word 'base' is thus a relative term with regard to its affix. Thus कृ + ता = कर्ता he will do हर्ता he will lose. करिष्यति, हरिष्यति. Here because the root कृ and हृ gets the name अंग they are <i>gunated</i> by [[7.3.84]]. Similarly because उपगु &c. get the name <i>Anga</i>, their vowel is <i>vriddhied</i> in औपगवः &c.

The words <i>kri</i> <i>hri</i> are <i>anga</i> with regard to the affix <i>ta</i> &c. उपगु + अण् = औपगवः; कापटवः. Here <i>upagu</i> and <i>kapatu</i> are <i>anga</i> with regard to <i>an</i>. Similarly कृ + स्य + वः = करिष्य + वः = करिष्यावः. Here the whole word form <i>Karishya</i> is regarded as <i>anga</i>, and as such the short <i>a</i> is lengthened by [[7.3.101]]; because though the affix <i>vah</i> is enjoined after the word <i>kri</i>, the form which begins with <i>kri</i> i.e. <i>karishya</i> will also be called <i>anga</i> when the affix is to be added. The word <i>tadadi</i>, therefore, has been used in the <i>sutra</i>, to make the definition of <i>Anga</i> applicable to the forms which a word may assume after taking the intermediate affixes like <i>sya</i> &c., or नुम् before the final affixes. Thus कुण्ड + नुम् + इ = कुण्डन् + इ = कुण्डानि [[7.1.72]] and [[6.4.8]] <i>kunda</i> + <i>num</i> + <i>i</i> = <i>kundan</i> +<i>i</i>  = <i>kundani</i>, bowls. Here the whole form <i>kundan</i> is called <i>anga</i>, and as such it lengthens its vowel before the case-affix <i>i</i> by [[6.4.8]].

Why have we used the word <i>pratyaya</i>? Without it the rule would have run thus :- 'After whatever there is anything enjoined &c., is called <i>Anga</i>.' Then in स्त्री + इयती = स्त्रयती. Here <i>sandhi</i> of vowels is enjoined between ई + इ = ई. If स्त्री was here an <i>Anga</i>, then its last last vowel would have been replaced by इयङ् [[6.4.77]], the form being स्त्रियियति.

Why have we used the word विधि ? Had we omitted it the rule would have run thus:-- "After whatsoever there is an affix, whether root or <i>pratipadika</i> is <i>Anga</i>." Thus in दधि अधुना, though the affix <i>adhuna</i> is placed after the word <i>dadhi</i>, it is not enjoined by any rule, and the word दधि is not called <i>anga</i>. Had it been so called, then the इ of <i>dadhi</i> should have been elided by rule [[6.4.148]].

The word <i>pratyaya</i> has been repeated twice in this <i>sutra</i> in order to show that when an affix is elided, the term <i>anga</i> will not apply to what stood before it. Thus in the compound word स्त्रियै + अर्थं = स्त्र्यर्थं for the sake of the woman. Here in forming the <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound the dative case-affix after the word स्त्री has been elided, for as a general rule case-affixes are elided in forming compounds. If the word स्त्री after its affix had been elided, still retained its old designation of <i>Anga</i>, the स्त्री + अर्थं would have been स्त्रियर्थं, the augment <i>iyan</i> being added by the rule already referred to above.
