The <i>sup</i> or case-affixes are those by which nouns are declined; and <i>tin</i> are tense-affixes by which verbs are conjugated. They have already been given before. Thus ब्राह्मण + जस् = ब्राह्मणाः the <i>Brahmanas</i> पचन्ति they cook.

It might be asked by a caviller why the word अन्त has been used in the aphorism, for by the rule of <i>tadanta</i> given in <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.72]] a rule relating to <i>sup</i> will mean and include also that which ended with a <i>sup</i>-affix. To this we reply, that the very fact that the word <i>anta</i> is used in this <i>sutra</i>, indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>) that the <i>Tadanta</i> rule of <i>Sutra</i> 72 Chapter I does not apply to rules of <i>sanjna</i> (definition) made with regard to affixes. Thus <i>tarap</i> and <i>tamap</i> affixes are called <i>gha</i> by <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.22]]. The <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> will not apply here; words ending with these affixes will not be called <i>gha</i>. Thus ब्राह्मणितरा will not be called <i>gha</i>, for had it been so called, the long ई will be shortened in गौरी ब्राह्मणितरा. In short, 'an affix when employed in a rule which teaches the meaning of a technical term (<i>sanjna</i>) does not denote a word-form ending with the affix.'
