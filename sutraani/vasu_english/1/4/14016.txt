The sutra 18 of this chapter teaches that before certain affixes, the preceding word is called <i>bha</i>. This <i>sutra</i> declares an exception to that by anticipation. Thus Rule [[4.2.115]] declares: -- "Affixes ठक् and छस् come after the <i>vriddha</i> [[1.1.74]] word भवत्." Here the affix छस् has an indicatory स्, therefore the word भवत्, standing before it, will be called <i>pada</i>. Thus भवत् + छस् = भवदीयः [[7.1.2]], belonging to you. The result of being <i>pada</i> is that ते is changed into द (VIII 2. 39). Similarly स् is इत् in युस् (After the word <i>urna</i> there is <i>yus</i> [[5.2.123]]. Thus ऊर्णायुः; so also घस् [[5.1.106]], has स् as indicatory. Thus ॠत्वियः There is no <i>guna</i> because of its being <i>pada</i>
