These words being taught here in the topic relating to <i>pada</i> and <i>Bha</i>, show that they have been properly forced in the <i>chhandas</i> by the application of the rules of <i>Bha</i> and <i>pada</i>. Thus अयस् + मय = अयस्मय made of iron. Here the word अयस् is treated as <i>Bha</i> and hence the स् is not changed into र. Thus अयस्मयं वर्म iron-made coat of mail. अयस्मयानि पात्राणि iron vessels. The present form of this word is अयोमयं. In some places both these <i>pada</i> and <i>Bha</i> apply simultaneously. Thus in the word ॠक्वत् formed by ऋच् + वत्, the च् is first changed into क् by treating the word rich as a <i>pada</i>. Then the word ॠक् is treated as <i>Bha</i>, and therefore the क् is not changed into ग् before वत्. For had it been <i>pada</i>, the form would have been ॠग्वत् <i>Rigvat</i>. These irregularly formed words occur only in the <i>chhandas</i> or Vedic literature. Thus स सुष्टुभास ऋक्वता गणेन.
