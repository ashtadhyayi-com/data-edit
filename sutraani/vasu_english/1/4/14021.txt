When it is intended to denote multeity those affixes should be employed after nouns and verbs, which denote plural number. Thus ब्राह्मणाः पठन्ति, The <i>Brahmins</i> read.

This rule applies to words which are capable of expressing numbers. Indeclinables (<i>Avyaya</i>) do not admit of numbers, and consequently they are always in singular number which is the general form.
