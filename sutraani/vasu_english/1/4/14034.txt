The word ज्ञीप्स्यमान means whom it is desired to make known or inform. As देवदत्ताय श्लाघते he praises <i>Devadatta</i>, i.e., while praising <i>Devadatta</i>, he wishes that he should know this praise. So also with other verbs. As देवदत्ताय ह्नुते he hides from (wishing that <i>Devadatta</i> should know of it) <i>Devadatta</i>, देवदत्ताय तिष्ठते she offers herself to <i>Devadatta</i> (for sexual embrace, wishing that he should know of it). देवदत्ताय शपते he reviles <i>Devadatta</i>.

Why do we say 'the person whom it is intended to inform'? Observe देवदत्ताय श्लाघति पथि. Here <i>pathi</i> is in the Locative case.
