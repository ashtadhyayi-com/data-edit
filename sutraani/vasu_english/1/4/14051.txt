There are some verbs in Sanskrit which take what is called an <i>akathita</i> object, in addition to their usual direct one. As its name indicates, it is that object which is not otherwise <i>kathita</i> or mentioned by way of any of the other case relations, such as अपादान अधिकरण &c. and is, therefore optional. If the noun capable of taking this <i>akathita</i> object be not intended for any other case, it is put in the Accusative case with such verbs; as, धेनुं दोग्धि पयः he milks the cow (her milk) व्रजमवरुणद्धि गां 'he confines the cow to the fold.' Here धेनुं and व्रजं are <i>akathita</i> or optional objects. If the speaker does not intend to have this object, the words will be put in their natural cases; as, धेन्वाः (ablative), पयोदोग्धि, व्रजे (locative) अवरुणद्धि गां.

The roots that are capable of governing two accusatives are mentioned in the following <i>karika</i>:-- दुह्याच् पच् दण्ड् रुधि प्रच्छि चि ब्रू शासु जि मन्थ् मुषाम् ॥ कर्मयुक् स्यादकथितं तथा स्या न्नी हृ कृष् वहाम् ॥

In the case of the roots दुह् 'to milk' याच् 'to beg,' पच् 'to cook,' दण्ड् 'to punish,' रुध् 'to obstruct or confine' प्रच्छ् 'to ask,' चि 'to collect' ब्रू 'to tell' शास् 'instruct' जि 'to win' (as a prize of wager) मन्थ् 'to churn' मुष् 'to steal,' and also in the case of नी, हृ, कृष्, and वह all meaning 'to take or carry' and others having the same signification, that noun which, besides the direct object, is affected by the verb, is put in the Accusative case; as, गां दोग्धि पयः (S. K.) 'he milks the cow'; बलिं याचते वसुधां. He begs the earth of <i>Bali</i>; similarly तंडुलानोदनं पचति, गर्गाञ् शतं दण्डयति, व्रजमवरुणद्धि गां, माणवकं पंथानं पृच्छति, वृक्षमवचिनोति फलानि, माणवकं धर्मं ब्रूते-शास्तिवा, शतं जयति देवदत्तं, सुधां क्षीरनिधिं मथ्नाति, देवदत्तं शतं मुष्णाति; ग्राममजां नयति-हरति-कर्षति-वहति वा are examples of the other roots in order. माणवकं धर्मं भाषते वक्ति वा, बलिं वसुधां भिक्षते, तां त्वां संवरणस्यार्थे वरयामि विभावसो are instances of this kind of object, because भाष् or वाच् and भिक्ष् or वृ have the same meaning as ब्रू and वाच्, the roots given in the <i>Kasika</i>.

Obs.-- The roots चि, मुष्, पच् मंथ्, रुध्, जि, कृष् हृ and ever वह् are of every rare occurrence as governing two accusatives, in the classical literature, though given in the above list.

The roots mentioned above and others having the same sense, take two objects. One of them is principal, and the other, secondary. In the case of the first twelve roots from दुह् to मुष्, the nouns पयः, वसुधां, फलानि, सुधां, &c. are principal objects, and गां, बलिं, वृक्षं, क्षीरनिधिं &c. are secondary objects, for they can, according to the speaker's volition, be put in other cases. And in the case of the last four roots अजा, is the principal object and ग्रामं the secondary. Thus that which is necessarily put in the accusative case in order to complete the idea of the verb, is the principal object, and that which may be put in the Accusative case, depending upon the speaker's will, is called the secondary object.
