The word प्राक् of this <i>sutra</i> serves the same purpose as the word <i>cha</i> of the last; namely, it makes the words <i>Gati</i>, <i>upasarga</i> and <i>karmapravachniya</i> take two names, i.e., their one name as well as the name <i>Nipata</i>. The letter र in  प्राग्रीश्वरात् is to remove doubt, i.e., aphorism [[1.4.97]] should be taken as limit and not <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.13]] which has the word <i>iswari</i> also.
