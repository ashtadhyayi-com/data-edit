As प्र + नयति = प्रणयति. Here the dental न is changed into cerebral ण, because of the प्र getting the designation of <i>upasarga</i> (See <i>sutra</i> [[8.4.14]]). Similarly परिणयति, प्रणायकः, परिणायकः.

Why do we say when in composition with a verb? When in composition with a noun they are not called <i>upasargas</i>. As प्रगतो नायकोऽस्माद् देशात् = प्रनायकोदेशः a country destitute of a leader. Here न is not changed into ण. Thus while प्रणायकः means 'a leader' the term प्रनायकः means destitute of a leader; though both have the same radical elements :-- <i>pra</i> in one is an <i>upasarga</i>, in the other a <i>Nipata</i> pure and simple.

Vart:- The word मरुत् should be included in the list of <i>upasargas</i>. As मरुद्भिर्दत्तः = मरुत्तः given by <i>Marut</i>. मरुत् + दा + क्त = मरुत् + त् + त [[7.4.47]]. Here <i>Marut</i> being treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, though it does not end with a vowel, the दा is replaced by त by rule [[7.4.47]] which declares 'त the substitute of दा which is called <i>ghu</i> when it is preceded by an <i>upasarga</i> that ends in a vowel, and is followed by an affix beginning with त which has an indicatory <i>k</i>.'

It might be objected, that as मरुत् does not end with a vowel, <i>sutra</i> [[7.4.47]] does not apply. To this we say that otherwise the giving the designation of <i>upasarga</i> to मरुत् is superfluous; and in order that this should not be so, the fact of its not ending with a vowel is overlooked.

Vart:- The particle श्रत् should be included in the list of <i>upasargas</i>. Thus श्रत् + धा + अङ् = श्रद्धा [[3.3.106]]. Here because श्रत् is treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, that <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.106]] is made applicable.
