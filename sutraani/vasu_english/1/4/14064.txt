The word अलम् is an indeclinable and has four meanings :- 'prohibition, competent, enough and ornament.' The term अलम् is <i>gati</i> when it means ornament.
As अलंकृत्य [[2.2.18]], [[7.1.37]]; अलंकृतं [[6.2.49]] यदलंकरोति [[8.2.71]] when it does not mean ornament we have अलं भुक्त्वा व्रजति he goes having eaten enough.
