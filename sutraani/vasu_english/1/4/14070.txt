The word <i>upadesa</i> means a direction to another. When a person cogitates within himself and does not address another, that is <i>anupadesa</i>. That is when it is not a demonstrative pronoun. As अदः कृत्य, अदः कृतम् and यददः करोति when used as a demonstrative pronoun we have अदः कृत्वा काण्डं गतः.
