As सुस्तुतं भवता well praised by you. सु सिक्तं भवता you have sprinkled. Here सु is a <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> and qualifies the sense of the verb, i. e. it is an adverb.

The term <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> is a big term compared with other technical terms such as, टि, घि, घु &c., which generally do not exceed more than two syllables. The word <i>karmapravachaniya</i> is not however merely a technical term; it contains within itself a definition of itself. It means that which qualities or speaks about (प्रोक्तवन्त) an action (कर्म) is so called.
