The force of अप and परि is in this case that of 'with the exception of.' As अपत्रिगर्त्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः it rained outside of or with the exception of <i>Trigarta</i>. So also परि त्रिगर्तेभ्यो वृष्टोदेवः. In this sense they govern the noun excluded in the ablative case [[2.3.10]]. When not having these senses, they are not <i>karma</i>-<i>pravachaniya</i>. As ओदनं परिषिञ्चति. He waters the rice. Here it is an <i>upasarga</i>, and hence changes the स into ष.
