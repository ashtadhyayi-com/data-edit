The word ईश्वर means 'master,' and it therefore requires another correlative word denoting 'property' of which one is master. The word <i>adhi</i> governs a Locative case. Sometimes locative of the person possessing, sometime locative of the property possessed: as अधि ब्रह्मदत्ते पंचालाः or अधि पंचालेषु ब्रह्मदत्तः. <i>Brahmadatta</i> rules over <i>Panchalas</i>.
