आ, ऐ and औ are called वृद्धि ।
This defines the word <i>vriddhi</i>. The letters आ, ऐ and औ are <i>vriddhi</i> letters. The <i>sutra</i> consists of three words <i>vriddhi</i>, <i>ât</i> and <i>aich</i>. आत् means the long आ, the final त् being indicatory only, and is for the sake of the <i>pratyâhâra</i> <i>aich</i>, and the <i>pratyâhâra</i> ऐच् means the letters ऐ and औ.

The indicatory त् in आत् serves the purpose of showing that the very form आ having two <i>måtrâs</i> or prosodial measure, is to be taken. This त् also joins with the succeeding vowels ऐ and औ by the rule of तपर [[1.1.70]] or that "which precedes or succeeds त्" and indicates that these vowels must be taken as having two <i>mâtrâs</i> only, though they may be the result of the combination of vowels whose aggregate <i>mâtrâs</i> may be more than two. A short vowel has one <i>måtrâ</i>, a long vowel has two, and a consonant has half a <i>mátrâ</i>. Thus by a rule of arm or euphonic conjunction of letters आ+आ=आ, as महा + आशयः = महाशयः. Here हा has two <i>mâtrâs</i> and not four. So also खट्वैडकः the vowel ऐ the resultant of आ+ऐ has only two, not four, <i>mâtrâs</i>.

Thus the initial vowels in the following secondary derivative nouns are <i>vriddhi</i> forms of their primitive vowels. आङ्गः "bodily", from अङ्गः; 'body' ऐच्छिकः "optional", from इच्छा "option"; औपगवः "the son of <i>Upagu</i>", from the word उपगुः meaning "a sage called <i>Upagu</i>". Similarly in शालीयः "belonging to the house" the आ is radical, and is also called <i>vriddhi</i>. The word <i>vriddhi</i> occurs in <i>sûtras</i> like सिचिवृद्धिपरस्मैपदेषु [[7.2.1]] "Let the final इक् of the base get <i>vriddhi</i> substitute before the affix सिच् of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>".
