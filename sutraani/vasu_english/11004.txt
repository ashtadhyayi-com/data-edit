The गुण and वृद्धि substitutions which otherwise would have presented themselves do not take place, when such an आर्धधातुक [[3.4.114]] affix follows, which causes a portion of the root to be elided.
This is an exception to <i>sūtra</i> 3. By that <i>sūtra</i> <i>iks</i> were to be <i>gunated</i> or <i>vriddhied</i> and by <i>sūtra</i> [[7.3.84]], the root is to be <i>gunated</i> before all <i>ardhadhatuka</i> terminations. All primary affixes, that are applied directly to roots in Sanskrit, are divided into two broad classes, called <i>sårvadhâtuka</i> and <i>årdhadhâtuka</i>. The affixes marked with an indicatory श (called शित्), and the conjugational affixes, such as तिप्, तः &c., (called तिङ्) are <i>sårvadhatuka</i>; all other affixes are called <i>årdhadhâtuka</i>.

Though by the general rule, [[7.3.84]], the root is to be <i>gunated</i> before <i>årdhadhâtuka</i> terminations, yet it is not to be so, before those affixes which cause the लोप 'lopping off or ellipses' of a portion or a member of the original <i>dhấtu</i>. Thus the termination स्यामि is a first person singular termination of the future tense ( लृट् ) and is an <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> termination; when this is added to root जि 'to excel' the इ of जि becomes <i>gunated</i> and we have जेष्यामि "I shall or will excel." But in those cases where there is a <i>lopa</i> of the member of a root form, caused by an affix, there is no <i>guṇation</i>. Thus in लोलुवः "a great cutter", the original root is लू "to cut" which forms the Intensive verb लोलूय. In forming the noun of agency from the verb लोलूय, an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> suffix अच् [[3.1.134]], is added. Thus लोलूय+अच्. At this stage, by force of <i>sūtra</i> [[2.4.74]] which declares that "before the affix अच् [[3.1.134]] the य of the Intensive verb must be suppressed," the <i>ya</i> is dropped and we have लोलू+अ. Here by the general rule [[7.3.84]], the final ऊ would have been <i>gunated</i>. But by virtue of the present <i>sūtra</i>, no <i>guna</i> takes place, because here on account of the <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> affix अच्, a portion of the root, namely, य, has been elided; therefore no <i>guņa</i> takes place. Thus we have लोलुवः "a great cutter."

The word धातु "root" has been used in the <i>sûtra</i>, in order to indicate that the exception does not apply where there is an elision of an <i>anubandha</i> or of an affix. As in लूञ्+इता = लो+इता = लविता. Here the indicatory letter ञ् has been elided, but that does not prevent <i>gunation</i>. Similarly in रेड् the affix विच् is added to the root रिष् "to injure." Thus रिष्+विच् [[3.2.75]] = रिष्+व् [[1.3.2]] and [[1.3.3]] = रिष्+० [[6.1.67]]. Here the affix व् is elided, but nevertheless, the <i>guṇa</i> substitute must take place in रिष्. Thus we have रिष्+० = रेष् [[7.3.86]] and [[1.1.62]] = रेड् [[8.2.39]].

The word <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> has been used to indicate that a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix which causes the elision of a portion of a root, does not prevent <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> as in रोरवीति, (<i>Rig Veda</i> IV.58.3) "he roars much". रू+यङ् = रोरुव [[3.1.22]]. रोरुय+तिप् = रोरु+ति [[2.4.74]]. Here the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix तिप् causes the elision of य, a portion of the root. The <i>guna</i> substitution however takes place, and we have रोरो+ई+ति [[7.3.94]] = रोरवीति, the augment ईट् being added by <i>sūtra</i> [[7.3.94]].

The word "<i>ikah</i>" of the previous <i>sūtra</i> is understood in this <i>sūtra</i> also. The <i>ik</i> letters only are not <i>gunated</i> or <i>vriddhied</i> before such <i>ardhadbatuka</i> affixes; the other vowels may do so. Thus in अभाजि the equation is as follows:- अ+भञ्ज्+चिण् = अ+भज्+इ [[6.4.33]]. Here the <i>ardhadhátuka</i> affix चिण् has caused a portion of the root भञ्ज्, to be suppressed, vis., the letter ञ् has been elided. But nevertheless the अ of भज् is <i>vriddhied</i> before चिण् because अ is not included in the <i>pratyahara</i> <i>ik</i> ; and the exception contained in the present <i>sutra</i> only applies to the <i>ik</i> letters. So also रञ्ज्+घञ् [[3.3.18]] = रज्+अ [[6.4.27]] = रागः [[7.2.116]] and [[7.3.52]].
