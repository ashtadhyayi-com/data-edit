And that, which otherwise would have caused गुण or वृद्धि, does not do so, when it has an indicatory क् , ग् , ङ्।
Thus the past participle terminations क्त and क्तवतु are <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes, which would, by the general rule [[7.3.84]], have caused <i>guna</i>, but as their indicatory letter क is इत्, the real terminations being, त and तवत्, they do not cause <i>guna</i>. Therefore, when these terminations are added to a root, the <i>ik</i> of the root is not <i>gunated</i>. Thus with the root चि "to collect" we have चितः or चितवान्, श्रू, "to hear", श्रुतः, श्रुतवान्; भी; "to fear" भीतः, भीतवान्.

Similarly the terminations क्यप् केलिम, क्वसु कानच्, क्त्वा, क्तिन्, &c., are all कित् terminations 'the indicatory letters of all being क्,' the real affixes being य, एलिम्, वस् &c. &c. &c. Before these, the root is not <i>gunated</i>. Thus we have from भृ "to bear" भृत्व, from भिद् "to pierce" भिदेलिम.

The terms कित् &c., of this <i>sûtra</i> are in the locative or seventh case. The force of this case termination here is that of निमित or cause, that is the <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> which would otherwise have been caused, does not take place, if an affix is कित्, गित्, ङित्. Thus all <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> and <i>sårvadhatuka</i> affixes cause <i>gunation</i> of the final <i>ik</i> of the inflective base [[7.3.84]] Thus the <i>Sårvadhâtuka</i> affix शप्(अ) in the following:-

भू+शप्+तिप् = भो+अ+ति = भवति "he is." Similarly <i>sårvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardbadhâtuka</i> affixes cause the <i>guna</i> substitution of the short penultimate <i>ik</i> of the inflective base [[7.3.85]]. Thus बुध्+शप्+तिप् = बोधति.

The general force of the locative case in an aphorism is to cause the operation directed, on the expression immediately preceding it [[1.1.66]]. If the force of the locative case in the present <i>sūtra</i> were also that as explained in [[1.1.66]], then the interpretation would be this:- An affix having an indicatory <i>k</i>, <i>g</i> or <i>ṅ</i>, would not cause the <i>guna</i> substitution of the vowel <i>ik</i>, immediately preceding it. The case of the penultimate short <i>ik</i> will not be covered by it. Then though the rule may apply to चि+क्त=चितः "collected" it would not apply to भिद्+क्त; there would be nothing to bar the <i>guna</i> substitution of the penultimate इ of भिद्. This however is prevented by explaining the locative as one of "occasion" and thus भिद्+क्त = भिन्नः "broken."

Similarly from the root जि we have a word जिष्णुः 'victorious', in which the affix ग्स्नु has an indicatory ग्. Thus जि+ग्स्नु = जिष्णुः "victorious" [[3.2.139]], so also स्थास्नुः "durable,"

Similarly the affix, अङ् is a ङित् affix, the real suffix being अ, the ङ् being merely indicatory. Therefore when अङ् is added to a root, there is no <i>gunation</i> or <i>vriddhing</i>. Thus we have from विद् "to know" विदः.

Similarly by [[1.2.4]], all <i>sårvadhâtuka</i> affixes that are not marked by an indicatory प्, are treated as ङित्. Thus the second person singular termination तस् is ङित्, and we have चिनुतः "they two collect," similarly चिन्वन्ति, "they collect", मृज्+क्त = मृष्टः "cleansed," मृजन्ति "they cleanse."

The phrase "when indicated by the term <i>ik</i>" is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The prohibition, therefore, applies to <i>ik</i> vowels only, and not to all vowels in general. Thus by [[3.1.30]], the root कम् "to desire" takes the affix णिङ्; of this affix the letters ण् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is इ. The force of ण् is to cause <i>vriddhi</i> [[7.2.116]]. The indicatory ङ् does not prevent such <i>vriddhi</i>, as the letter अ of कम् is not included in <i>ik</i>. Thus we have कामि+अते = कामे+अते = कामयते "he desires".

According to the wish of the author of the <i>Mahabhashya</i>, the verb मृज् optionally takes <i>vriddhi</i>, before <i>kit</i> or <i>ṅit</i> affixes beginning with a vowel. As परिमृजन्ति or परिमार्जन्ति "they rub." Here in this <i>sūtra</i> there is prohibition of the <i>guna</i> of the short penultimate <i>ik</i> also.

The indicatory ङ् of the verbal tense affixes i.e., लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ्, लृङ् is an exception to this rule of ङित्. This is an inference deduced from [[3.4.104]] which declares "when the sense is that of benediction, then the augment यासुट् of लिङ् is as if it were distinguished by an indicatory क." There would have been no necessity of making यासुट् a कित्, if लिङ् were a ङित्, but the very fact of making यासुट् a कित् indicates by implication or is ज्ञापक that the final ङ of लिङ्, लङ् &c. does not make these tense affixes ङित्. Thus in लङ् or Imperfect tense we have अचिनवम् "he collected" (अचिनू+लङ् = अचिनु+अम् = अचिनो+अम् = अचिनवम्.)
