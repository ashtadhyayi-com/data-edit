The गुण and वृद्धि substitutions which otherwise would have presented themselves do not however come, in the place of the vowels of दिधि 'to shine' and वेवि 'to go', and of the augment called इट् ।
The roots दीधी and वेवी never take the <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> substitutions under ordinary circumstances. Thus the affix ण्वुल् generally causes <i>vriddhi</i> substitution when added to any root; and so the affix ल्युट् causes <i>guņa</i>. But these affixes when applied to the verbs <i>didhi</i> and <i>vevi</i>, never cause <i>vřiddhi</i> or <i>guna</i> substitution. As आदीधी+ण्वुल् = आदीधी+अक [[7.1.1]] = आदीध्वकः [[6.1.77]]. So also आदीधी+ल्युट् = आदीधी+अन [[7.1.1]] = आदीध्वनम्. Similarly from वेवी we have आवेव्यनम् and आवेव्यकः. In the Vedas, however, these verbs take <i>guna</i>. Thus अदीधेत् (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. X.98.7), and अदीधयुः (<i>Rig</i> <i>Ved</i>. V.40.5). These two verbs are confined generally to the Vedic literature, and the present rule therefore, seems to be an unnecessary prohibition; as they take <i>guna</i> in spite of such prohibition.

Of the augment इट् the real affix is इ. In the general tenses, it is added to certain terminations beginning with consonants of the वल् class, i.e., all consonants except य [[7.2.35]]. Thus the future termination, first person, singular is स्यामि; this when added to the root चर् "to move" requires an intermediate इ, and thus we have the form चरिष्यामि, 'I shall walk.' This इ is never <i>gunated</i> or <i>vriddhied</i>, though according to the general rule, coming before an <i>ardhadhâtuka</i> termination, it ought to have been <i>gunated</i>.

The augment इट्, could under no circumstances have taken <i>vriddhi</i>, the prohibition therefore, is in the case of the <i>guna</i> substitute of इट्.
