There is however no homogeneity between vowels and consonants, though their place and effort be equal.
This <i>sutra</i> lays down an exception to the former <i>sutra</i>. There can be no homogeneity or <i>savarna</i> relationship between vowels and consonants, though their आस्य and प्रयत्न may be the same. Thus इ and श have the same आस्य namely तालु 'palate,' and the same प्रयत्नः namely <i>vivrita</i>, but still they are not to be called <i>savarna</i>. Thus in दण्डहस्त, दधिशीतलं &c., the letters अ and ह in the first example, and इ and श in the second not being homogeneous letters; there is no combination or <i>sandhi</i>, which would otherwise have taken place.

Similarly if श and इ be held homogeneous, then विपाश+अण् [[4.3.53]] = विपाश्+अण् [[6.4.148]]; here श would be elided by [[6.4.148]], but it is not so and we have वैपाशः "belonging to <i>vipåså</i> or born therein." So also in आनडुहं "ox-skin," the ह would have been omitted, if held homogeneous with अ.
