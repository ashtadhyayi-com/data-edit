A dual case affix ending in ई or ऊ or ए is called प्रगृह्य , or excepted vowels which do not admit सन्धि or conjugation.
As a general rule, Sanskrit allows of no hiatus in a sentence. If a word ends in a vowel, and the next word begins with a vowel, the two vowels coalesce, according to certain rules. This is called <i>sandhi</i>. But <i>pragrihyas</i> are exceptions to this <i>sandhi</i>, "they are certain terminations, the final vowels of which are not liable to any <i>sandhi</i> rules." [[6.1.125]]. This <i>sutra</i> gives three of these terminations, viz., the duals of nouns or verbs ending in ई (ईत्), ऊ (ऊत्), ए (एत्). Thus:- कवी इमौ "these two poets," so also वायू इति "two winds;" माले इति "these two garlands." पचेते इति "they two cook" पचेथे इति "you two cook." Here according to the general rule of <i>sandhi</i>, the final इ of कवी and the initial इ of इमौ ought to have coalesced into an ई, but it is not so, because कवी is the nominative dual of कवि.

Why do we say ending in <i>ī</i>, <i>ū</i> and <i>e</i>? Because when the dual ends in any other vowel this rule will not apply. As वृक्षौ+अत्र = वृक्षावत्र, "these two trees" [[6.1.78]]. Of course it follows from the definition, that ई, ऊ, or ए of the dual number only are <i>pragrihya</i>; if these vowels terminate any other number they will not be <i>pragřihya</i> but will follow the general rule of <i>sandhi</i>, as कुमारी (I.S.) + अत्र = कुमार्य्यत्र, "the girl is here" [[6.1.77]].

<i>Vart</i>: The prohibition of मनीव &c., should be stated in treating of the <i>pragrihya</i> nature of ई, ऊ &c. Thus मनी (two gems) + इव = मनीव "like two gems". So also दम्पतीव "like a couple," जम्पतीव "like man and wife," रोदसीव "like heaven and earth." Some say that this <i>vårtika</i> is unneccessary. Because the final member of the above words is not इव, but the particle व only; which has the same meaning as <i>iva</i>.
