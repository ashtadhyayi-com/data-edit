The same letters after the म् of the pronoun अदस् are प्रगृह्य।
In the pronoun अदस्, the dual termination in ई, ऊ or ए will be <i>pragrihya</i> by force of the last <i>sūtra</i>, but the present <i>sûtra</i> makes this addition, that in the case of अदस्, all terminations ending in ई, ऊ or ए and preceded by म, of whatever number they may be, will be <i>pragrihya</i>. As a matter of fact, there are only two such terminations satisfying the above conditions namely अमी and अमू. The rule may therefore be put in the following words of Dr. Max Muller:- "The terminations of अमी and अमू nom. plur. masc. and nom. dual of the pronoun अदस् are <i>pragrihya</i>." As अमी अश्वाः "Those horses", and अमू आसते. There is no example of the word <i>adas</i> ending in ए.

Why do we say "of the word <i>adas</i>"? The letters ई, ऊ, ए following after the म् of any other word will not be <i>pragrihya</i>. As शमी+अत्र = शम्यत्र "this <i>sami</i> tree."

Why do we say "after the letter म्"? Because in the example अमुके+अत्र = अमुकेऽत्र, "those here," the ए, preceded not by म् but by the क of अकच् [[5.3.71]] is not <i>pragrihya</i>, which it would have been by the influence of <i>sūtra</i> II, which includes ए as well as ई and ऊ, and from which the word dual is not supplied here, else this rule would be useless.
