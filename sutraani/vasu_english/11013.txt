The affix शे (the Vedic substitute of the case-affixes) is a प्रगृह्य।
In the Vedic Sanskrit, the declension of nouns sometimes differs somewhat from the ordinary Sanskrit. One of the peculiar Vedic terminations, which replace the ordinary declensional terminations is called शे [[7.1.39]]. Thus अस्मेइन्द्राबृहस्पती.

Of this substitute शे, the initial श is indicatory, the real suffix being ए. This final ए is a <i>pragrihya</i>.

In the sacred literature there is only one example of this <i>pragrihya</i>, as given above; while in imitation of this, we have in secular writing phrases as, त्वेइति, युष्मे इति, मे इति &c.
