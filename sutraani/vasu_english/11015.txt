The final ओ of a particle is a प्रगृह्य।
This <i>sútra</i> consists of one word ओत् the final त् is a surplusage. The words "<i>pragrihya</i>" and "<i>nipåta</i>" are to be supplied from the preceding <i>sutras</i> to complete the sense. The meaning is that those particles which end in ओ though consisting of several letters, are <i>pragrihya</i>. As अहो अपेहि "Halloo, go away."
