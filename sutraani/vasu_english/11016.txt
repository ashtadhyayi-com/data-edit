The final ओ of a vocative singular [[2.3.49]] before the word इति according to शाकल्य , in a secular or non-vedic literature is a प्रगृह्य।
This <i>sūtra</i> gives the opinion of the <i>Rishi</i> <i>Sakalya</i>, so that it is an optional rule. Thus both forms वायविति (formed according to the general rule of <i>sandhi</i>) and वायो इति (where ओ is <i>pragrihya</i>) are correct.

In <i>ârsha</i> literature the <i>sandhi</i> is imperative, not optional, as एता गा ब्रह्मबन्धवित्यब्रवीत्.

The mention of the name of any sage, such as that of <i>Sakalya</i> in this <i>sūtra</i>, serves generally one of the two purposes :- (1) either it makes the rule an optional one, <i>vibhåshartham</i>, or (2) the mention is merely for the sake of showing respect to the particular sage, the rule would have stood as well without such mention; <i>pujártham</i>, as the word <i>Kåsyapa</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.15]].
