The particle ऊँ replaces उञ in non-vedic literature and it is a प्रगृह्य in the opinion of शाकल्य।
Before the word इति the word ऊञ् is replaced sometimes by ऊँ the long nasal <i>ū</i>. Thus ऊँ+इति = ऊँ इति or विति.

In some authorities the <i>sûtras</i> [[1.1.17]] and [[1.1.18]] form but one <i>sūtra</i>, and then it is divided by the method of <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhága</i>, the division of a single <i>sūtra</i> into two separate <i>sûtras</i> having two distinct rules.
