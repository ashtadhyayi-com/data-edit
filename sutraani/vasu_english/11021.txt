An operation should be performed on a single letter, as upon an initial or upon a final.
This is an <i>atidesa</i> <i>sutra</i> and consists of four words, आदि "the beginning,"  अन्त "end," वत् "like," एकस्मिन् "in one;" the literal translation being "beginning is end-like in one." The affix वत् has the force of the locative, and the meaning is "on the beginning," and "on the end," i.e., let an operation be performed on a single letter, as upon an initial or upon a final. Thus by [[3.1.3]]. an affix has <i>udatta</i> or acute accent on its initial vowel. Thus the affix <i>tavya</i> has accent on the first अ, and we have कर्त्तव्य॑म्. But when an affix consists of a single vowel, it is itself the beginning and the end, and, as such, will have the accent. As in औपगवम् <i>aupagavam</i> the last <i>a</i> has the accent, which <i>a</i> represents the affix अण्.

Similarly, by [[7.3.102]], the final of a base ending in short अ is lengthened before a case-affix beginning with a consonant of यञ् class. Thus राम + भ्याम् = रामाभ्याम्. This rule will apply when the word consists of one letter only, and that letter is a short अ. Thus अ + भ्याम् = आभ्याम् "by those two." Here it must not be objected that the solitary अ is initial, and cannot be final.

Why do we say "in one"? If a word consists of more than one letter, then the beginning is not like the end. Thus in the word सभा the initial short अ is not like the final long आ; otherwise सभा would get the name of वृद्धम् [[1.1.73]], and the secondary derivative from सभासन्नयन would be formed by the affix छ् [[4.2.114]]. But this is not so, the affix अण् is employed instead, and the form is साभासन्नयनः.
