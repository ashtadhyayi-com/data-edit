The words बहु 'many' , गण 'class' and the words ending in the affix वतु -- यद्तदेतेभ्यः परिमाणे वतुप् [[5.2.39]] and डति -- किमः संख्यापरिमाणे डति च [[5.2.41]] are called numerals (संख्या).
This <i>sutra</i> defines the word <i>sankhya</i>, or numeral.

These are certain words, besides the ordinary numerals, having some peculiarity of declension. The words like बहु 'many,' and गण 'class', and those that have the affixes वत् and अति after them, belong to this class. The letters उ and ड of वतु and डति are इत्, or indicatory, the actual affixes being वत् and अति.

The word <i>sankhya</i> means "numerals;" and this class contains, among others, the Sanskrit numerals. The words formed by adding वतु are generally compound pronouns, e.g. तावत् "so much," यावत् "as much," एतावत् "so much," similarly words formed by the affix डति, e.g. कति "how many," तति "so many," यति "as many."

Thus बहु + कृत्वसुच् [[5.4.17]] = बहुकृत्वः "many times" the affix कृत्वसुच् being added only to <i>sankhya</i> words in the sense of the repetition of the action. So also बहु + धा [[5.3.42]] = बहुधा "in many ways." Here also the affix धा is added by virtue of बहु being a <i>sankhya</i>. Similarly बहुकः [[5.1.22]] "purchased for a big sum," बहुशः [[5.4.43]] "manifold." So also गणकृत्वः, गणधा, गणकः, गणशः; so also तावत्कृत्वः, तावद्धा, तावच्छः, कतिकृत्वः; कतिधा, कतिकः, कतिशः.

When the words बहु and गण mean "abundance" and "multitude" they are not <i>sankhya</i>. It is only when they are expressive of numbers, that they get the designation of <i>sankhya</i>. The necessity of defining <i>sankhya</i> arose in order to exclude such words as, भूरि "numerous," &c., which though they express numbers, are not to be treated as "numerals," technically so called.

Vart:- The word अर्द्ध "half" when standing as a first term in a compound number which takes an affix giving the sense of an ordinal, gets the designation of <i>sankhya</i>, for the purposes of the application of the rules of <i>samasa</i> and of the affix कन्. The ordinal affixes or <i>purana</i> <i>pratyayas</i> are like डट् [[5.2.48]], मट् [[5.2.49]], थक् [[5.2.51]], &c. Thus एकादशः "eleventh," पंचमः "fifth," चतुर्थः "fourth," &c. Similarly we have अर्द्धपंचशूर्पः "purchased for 41/2 baskets" (a <i>dvigu</i>). Here अर्द्ध + पंचमा (an ordinal) = अर्द्धपंचम्, a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound meaning 41/2, vis., that in which half is the fifth term. अर्द्धपंचमैः शूर्पैः क्रीतः = अर्द्धपंचमशूर्पः the <i>taddhita</i> affixes ठञ् and अञ् required by [[5.1.19]] and [[5.1.26]] being elided by [[5.1.28]].

Here, there is compounding (<i>dvigu</i>) by taking अर्द्धपंचमम् as a <i>sankhya</i>, and then applying <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.51]]. The <i>samasa</i> here is in the sense of <i>taddhita</i>, and this compounding is only possible by rules [[2.1.50]] and [[2.1.51]], when अर्द्धपंचमम् gets the appellation of <i>sankhya</i>. Having got this name, it forms <i>dvigu</i> compound in the sense of the <i>taddhita</i> affixes अञ् and ठञ् [[5.1.26]]. The word शूर्प takes both these affixes in the sense of "being bought with." Thus शौर्पिकम् and शौर्पम् both mean "bought with a measure called <i>surpa</i>." In the above compound of अर्द्धपंचमशुर्पः the sense is that of the above-named <i>taddhita</i>; but the affixes have been elided by [[5.1.28]] after <i>dvigu</i> compounds. So also we have अर्द्धपंचमकः by applying the affix कन्. For these two purposes, namely <i>samasa</i> and the application of कन्, compounds of <i>ardha</i>, like <i>ardha</i>-<i>panchama</i> are treated as <i>sankhya</i>.
