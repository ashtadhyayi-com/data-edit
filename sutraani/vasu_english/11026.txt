The affixes क्त and क्तवतु are called निष्ठा।
This defines the <i>nishtha</i> affixes, that is to say, the affixes of the past participle. The actual affixes are त, तवत्, the क and उ being indicatory. They being कित् are liable to all the rules applicable to कित् affixes, such as rule [[1.1.5]]. Thus we have, कृतः, कृतवान्, भुक्तः, भुक्तवान्.

The force of the indicatory उ in <i>ktavatu</i> is, by [[4.1.6]], to indicate that in forming the feminine of nouns ending in an affix having an indicatory vowel of <i>uk</i> <i>pratyahara</i> (उ, ऋ, लृ), the affix ङीप् (ई) must be added. Thus कृतवान् (masc.), कृतवती (fem.). The word <i>nishtha</i> occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.14]].
