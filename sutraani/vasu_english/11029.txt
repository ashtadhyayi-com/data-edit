The words सर्व etc. are not सर्वनाम when they occur in a बहुव्रीही compound.
As a general rule (see <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.72]]), when any definition, rule, operation &c. is made applicable to a particular word, the same would also apply to any other word which ends in that word. Thus the plural of man being 'men' in English, the plural of blackman will be blackmen. So the definition of <i>sarvanama</i> given to <i>sarva</i> &c., separately, will also apply to the words ending in <i>sarva</i> &c.

This <i>sutra</i> introduces thus an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.27]]. In <i>bahuvrihi</i> or possessive compounds, the nature of which compounds will be described later on, the above mentioned words are not pronominals, and must follow the ordinary rule of declension. Thus the compound प्रियविश्व meaning 'beloved of all' is a <i>bahuvrihi</i> compound of प्रिय 'beloved,' and विश्व 'all,' (which is a <i>sarvanama</i>). The declension of this compound will follow the general rule. Thus, in the dative singular, we have प्रियविश्वाय, though the dative singular of विश्व by itself is विश्वस्मै, like other pronominals. So also प्रियोभयाय "to him who is beloved of both." So also द्व्यन्याय, त्र्यन्याय &c.

Similarly in <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds, these words not being treated as pronominals, they do not take also the special affix अकच्, but the general affix कन्. As, त्वत्कपितृको, मत्कपितृको [[5.3.70]].

Though the word <i>bahuvrihi</i> was present in this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from the last aphorism, the object of using the word <i>bahuvrihi</i> again in this <i>sutra</i>, is this :-- that the prohibition may apply to those expressions also which are no longer <i>bahuvrihi</i>, but whose original components were once <i>bahuvrihi</i>. Thus the words वस्त्रान्तरा and वसनान्तरा are <i>bahuvrihi</i> compounds; but when these two words are further compounded into a <i>dvandva</i> compound, the present rule still applies. As, वस्त्रान्तरावसनान्तराः ॥
