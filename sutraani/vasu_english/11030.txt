In the Instrumental Determinative Compounds the words सर्व etc. are not सर्वनाम।
This is another exception to the definition of <i>sarvanama</i>. There is a class of compounds in Sanskrit<i> called </i>tatpurusha<i> compounds, in which the last word governs the preceding one. The word governed may be in any one of the six cases: when it is in the third or instrumental case, the compound is called </i>tritiya<i> </i>tatpurusha<i>. When, therefore, there is such a </i>samasa<i>, the words mentioned in </i>sutra<i> [[1.1.26]] are not to be declined like pronominals. Thus the word मासपूर्व is a compound of मास and पूर्व = मासेनपूर्व meaning 'prior by a month,' where the word </i>masa<i> is in the instrumental case. This compound will be declined like ordinary words, e.g. its dative will be मासपूर्वाय, though the dative of पूर्व, when standing by itself, is पूर्वस्मै; so also संवत्सरपूर्वाय ॥

The </i>tritiya<i>-</i>samasa<i> of the present </i>sutra<i> has reference to the special </i>tritiya<i>-</i>samasa<i> ordained by the particular </i>sutra<i> [[2.1.31]]. namely, "that which ends with the 3rd case affix, is compounded with the words </i>purva<i>, </i>sadrisa<i>, </i>sama<i>, &c." and has not reference to the </i>tritiya<i>-</i>samasa<i> in general, such as one ordained by [[2.1.32]]," that which ends with the 3rd case-affix when it denotes the agent or the instrument is compounded diversely with what ends in a </i>krit<i> affix." Therefore, in phrases त्वयका कृतं 'done by thee,' मयका कृतं 'done by me,' these words are treated as pronominals, though in the instrumental case followed by a word ending in a </i>krit<i>-affix. In other words, reading this </i>sutra<i> with [[2.1.31]], we find that </i>purva<i> is the only </i>sarvanama<i> which is so compounded, and to which only the present </i>sutra<i> would seem to apply.

The word समास may appear to have been mentioned redundantly, as it has already been mentioned in the previous </i>sutra<i>, the primary object of the </i>sutra<i> authors being to shorten the rules by the keeping out of every unnecessary word. But here, the word समास has been repeated, to show that even in phrases like मासेन पूर्वाय, though not a compound, but used in construction with an instrumental case, the word पूर्व is not a </i>sarvanama_, that is to say, the prohibition extends even to phrases, which bear the sense of the instrumental compound, though not exhibited in the form of the instrumental compound.
