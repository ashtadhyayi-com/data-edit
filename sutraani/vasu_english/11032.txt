Their द्वन्द compounds are optionally सर्वनाम when the nominative plural termination जस् follows.
This is a proviso to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.31]], and declares that before the termination जस् (which is the termination of the nominative plural, as we shall find later on, and which in the pronominals is replaced by शी), the <i>dvandva</i> compounds may be treated either as <i>sarvanamas</i> or as ordinary words. Thus the plural of वर्णाश्रमेतर may be either  वर्णाश्रमेतराः or ०तरे, that is, the word may take either जस् or शी.

This <i>sutra</i> governs the four succeeding <i>sutras</i>. The option allowed in the case of the application of the affix Ist pl. to the <i>dvandva</i> compounds of pronominals, does not extend to the <i>dvandva</i> compounds of pronominal which take the affix अकच् [[5.3.71]]. There the <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.31]] is absolute. Thus, कतरः + कतमकः = कतरकतमकाः in the plural. This affix अक (अकच्) comes before the last vowel, with what follows it, of the pronominals and indeclinables.
