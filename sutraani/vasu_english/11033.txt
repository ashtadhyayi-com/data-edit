And also the words प्रथम 'first', चरम 'last', words with the affix तय -- संख्याया अवयवे तयप् [[5.2.42]], अल्प 'few', अर्ध 'half', कतिपय 'some' and नेम 'half' are optionally सर्वनाम , before the Nominative Plural termination.

Thus we have प्रथमे or प्रथमाः, चरमे or चरमाः, अल्पे or अल्पाः, अर्द्धे or अर्द्धाः, कतिपये or कतिपयाः, नेमे or नेमाः, द्वितये or द्वितयाः ॥

The words "optionally when the affix जस् follow" are understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The governing force of the word "<i>dvandva</i>" does not extend to this, and stops at this. By the word तय in the aphorism, is meant words ending in the affix तय. The rest are <i>pratipadikas</i> or crude bases. The word नेम has already been enumerated among the pronominals, therefore, the option in its case, is what is called <i>prapta</i>-<i>vibhasa</i>, the result of which will be that though in the nom. pl. it may be declined like नर, the rest of its declension is like <i>sarva</i>, while in the case of <i>prathama</i> &c. the nom. pl. may be like <i>sarva</i>, but the rest of their declension must be like that of <i>nara</i>. The word <i>ubhaya</i>, has been formed by the addition of the affix तय, and it is already enumerated in the list of pronominals, therefore, by the present <i>sutra</i> its nom. pl. admits of two forms.

The application of the affix <i>kan</i> or <i>akach</i> must depend upon the nature of these words, if pronominals, then <i>akach</i>, otherwise <i>kan</i>.
