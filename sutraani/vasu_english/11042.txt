The affix शि [[7.1.20]] is called सर्वनामस्थान।
This defines the word <i>sarvanamasthana</i>. The affix शि is the nominative and accusative plural termination of neuter nouns. It replaces the ordinary nominative and accusative plural affixes जस् and शस् used in every other gender. The श्र of शि is servile, and the actual termination is इ; the peculiarity of the affix शि is that it lengthens the penultimate vowel [[6.4.8]] and adds a न् [[7.1.72]]. Thus the plural of फल 'fruit' is फलानि 'fruits.' So also कुण्डानि तिष्ठन्ति, and कुण्डानि पश्य. Here, there is no difference of form in the nominative and the accusative cases. So also मधूनि, त्रपूणि, जतूनि. The word <i>sarvanamasthana</i> occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.8]].
