And the substitute which is indicatory ङ् (even though it consists of more than one letter) takes the place of the final letter only of the original expression.
This <i>sutra</i> is an exception by anticipation to <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.55]]. By that all substitutes, consisting of more than one letter, replace the whole word.

Thus in forming the <i>dvandva</i> compound of मातृ and पितृ there is a rule [[6.3.25]] by which it is declared:- 'In the place of words ending in ॠ there is the substitution of आनङ् in forming <i>dvandvas</i>.' Now the substitute आनङ् is a ङित् substitute, and therefore it applies to the last letter of the word and not to the whole word, vis, the ॠ of मातृ is only changed into आ and not the whole word; and we have the compound मातापितरौ, so also होतापोतारौ.

There is an exception, however, in the case of the substitute तातङ् [[7.1.35]] which, though it has an indicatory ङ्, yet replaces the whole expressions तु and हि and not only their finals. As जीवतात् 'may he live, or may you live'; instead of जीवतु 'may he live,' or जीव 'live thou.'
