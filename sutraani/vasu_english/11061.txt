The disappearance of an affix when it is caused by the words लुक् , श्लु or लुप् are designated by those terms respectively.
When an affix is elided by using the term <i>luk</i>, that disappearance gets the appellation of <i>luk</i>, similarly when an affix is elided by using the terms <i>slu</i> or <i>lup</i>, the disappearance gets the name of <i>slu</i> or <i>lup</i>.

Thus in अद् + शप्लुक् + ति = अत्ति 'he eats.' Here the <i>vikarana</i> शप् has been elided by using the word <i>luk</i> [[2.4.72]]. Similarly in जुहोति 'he invokes,' the <i>vikarana</i> शप् is elided by the word <i>slu</i> [[2.4.75]], so in वरणाः 'a city in the vicinity of weeds called <i>varana</i>.' Here the <i>Taddhita</i> affix indicating vicinity has been elided by the word <i>lup</i>. [[4.2.82]].

Why do we use the words "of the affix"? Without these words, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus:- "The disappearance is called <i>luk</i>, <i>slu</i> or <i>lup</i>." So that the disappearance of a base would also be caused by the use of these terms. Thus in [[2.4.70]], there would have been '<i>luk</i>' of the bases <i>agastya</i>, and <i>kaundinya</i>; which however is not intended. In that <i>sutra</i>, the '<i>luk</i>' of the affixes is only intended. So also in <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.168]] there would have been the substitution of '<i>luk</i>' for the bases of the words.
