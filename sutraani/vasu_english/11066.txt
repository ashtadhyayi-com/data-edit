When a term is exhibited in the seventh case in these sūtras, the operation directed, is to be understood as effecting the state of what immediately precedes the which the term denotes.
This is a declaratory or interpreting <i>sutra</i>. When in a <i>sutra</i>, a word is used in the locative case, the operation ordained by that <i>sutra</i> is to be performed on the word preceding it. Thus in the <i>sutra</i> इको यणचि [[6.1.77]] the word अचि is in the locative case, which <i>sutra</i>, therefore, means that इ, उ, ऋ लृ followed by a vowel (अच्) are changed into य्, व्, र्, ल्, (यण्). The literal translation of the <i>sutra</i> being:- 'Of इक् there is यण् in अच्.' The force of 'in' or the locative case being to induce changes in the letter preceding the vowel. Thus दधि + उदकम् = दध्युदकम्; So मध्विदम्, पचत्योदनम् ॥

The word <i>nirdishta</i> (meaning 'exhibited') has been used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate immediateness. Thus in अग्निचित्, the इ of अग्नि the is not directly followed by the इ of चित्, there being the letter च् intervening, therefore, rule [[6.1.77]], does not apply here : and we have no <i>sandhi</i>.
