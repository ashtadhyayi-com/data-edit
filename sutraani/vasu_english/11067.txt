An operation caused by the exhibition of a term in the Ablative 5th case, is to be understood to enjoin the substitution of something in the room of that which immediately follows the word denoted by the term.
This <i>sutra</i> explains the force of words in the ablative case when employed in these aphorisms. As the locative case refers to a preceding word, so the ablative refers to a succeeding word.

Thus <i>sutra</i> [[8.4.61]] declares that 'after उद्, of <i>stha</i> and <i>stambha</i>, the substitute is a letter belonging to the class of the prior.' Thus उद् + स्थानम्. Here the word उदः is exhibited in the original <i>sutra</i> in the ablative case, and by the present <i>sutra</i> it means that a dental letter थ् must be substituted in the place of <i>sthana</i>, and by [[1.1.54]] <i>ante</i>, this dental takes the place of स्; we have उद् + थ्थानम् = उत्थ्-थानम्. Similarly in <i>sutra</i> तिङ् ङतिङः[[8.2.18]], 'a word ending in a conjugational affix, when following after a word ending in a non-conjugational affix, becomes <i>anudatta</i>.') Here the word '<i>atinah</i>' is exhibited in the ablative case, therefore, the operation directed by this aphorism, namely, the substitution of <i>anudatta</i> accent, must take place in the word that follows. Thus ओदनं पचति; but not so in पचत्योदनमिति ॥
