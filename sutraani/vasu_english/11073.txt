That word, among the vowels of which the first is a वृद्धि , is called वृद्धम्। 
This defines the word वृद्धम्. The <i>sutra</i> consists of five words :- वृद्धिः 'the <i>vriddhi</i> vowel;' यस्य 'whose,' अचाम् 'among the vowels,' आदिः 'is first;' तद् 'that; वृद्धम् 'is called <i>vriddham</i>.'

If a word consisting of many vowels, has a <i>vriddhi</i> vowel coming first in the order of vowels, that word is called <i>vriddham</i>. Thus the words माला, शाला &c., have the first vowel आ a <i>vriddhi</i> vowel, therefore, they are called <i>vriddham</i>.

The word <i>vriddham</i> has been defined in order to make applicable to these peculiar words certain <i>taddhita</i> affixes. Thus there is a rule [[4.2.114]] by which the affix छ् is added to <i>vriddham</i>. Thus माला + छ् = मालीयः ॥

Why do we say "the first?" Because a word like सभासंनयनः, which is not a <i>vriddha</i> word, will not admit of the affix छ्. Its corresponding derivative will be साभासंनयनः ॥

Vart:- A proper noun, though not coming under the above definition, may yet be regarded optionally as a <i>vriddham</i>. Thus देवदत्त + छ् = देवदत्तीया, or we may have दैवदत्ता.

Vart:- A compound ending in a <i>Gotra</i> word, is regarded for the purposes of the addition of this affix, as if it was not compounded. Thus रौढि is a <i>Gotra</i> word and also <i>vriddham</i>. Its compound घृतरौढि will be regarded as a <i>vriddham</i> too, for the addition of the affix. As घृतरौढि + छ् = घृतरौढीयाः 'the students of <i>Ghritaraudhi</i>.' So also ओदनपाणिनीयाः, वृद्धाम्भीयाः वृद्धकाश्यपीयाः &c.

Vart:- Exception must be made in the case of जिह्वाकात्य and हरितकात्य । They do not take छ्. Thus जैह्वाकाता and हारितकाताः.
