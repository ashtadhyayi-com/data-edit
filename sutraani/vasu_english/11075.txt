A word that has the letters ए and ओ as the first among its vowels, gets also the designation of वृद्धम्।
As गोनर्द is a country of the east, it is a <i>vriddham</i> word and we have गोनर्द + छ् = गोनर्दीयः; similarly एणीपचनीयम्, भोजकटीयः.

The word <i>prak</i> in the <i>sutra</i> has been differently interpreted. The Grammarian <i>Kunin</i> takes the word <i>prak</i> as an epithet qualifying the word <i>acharya</i>, 'professor' understood. In that case the <i>sutra</i> will be thus translated:- 'In the opinion of the Eastern (or ancient) professors, a word that has the letters e and o as the first among its vowels, and is the name of a country, is called <i>vriddham</i>.' Under this interpretation, this will be an optional rule only, giving the opinion of eastern or ancient grammarians.

Others however take the word <i>prak</i> as qualifying the word <i>desa</i> and the meaning then is as given in the text.

Why do we say 'having the letters ए and ओ'? If a simple vowel is first among the vowels, of a word, that word will not be called <i>vriddham</i>: and as such will not take the affix छ्; as आहिच्छत्रः, कान्यकुब्जः. 

Why do we say of 'Eastern country'? Because this rule does not apply to a word like देवदत्तः which is the name of a town in the <i>Punjab</i>, which is not an eastern country. Its secondary derivative will be दैवदत्तः, born in <i>Devadatta</i>.

Why do we say 'country'? The rule will not apply to rivers &c. Thus from गोमति we have गौमताः 'fish born in the river <i>Gomati</i>.'
