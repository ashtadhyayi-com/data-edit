The affixes of लिट् (Perfect Tense) not coming after a conjunct consonant, are as if they had an indicatory क् (कित्).
With this <i>sutra</i> begins the description of affixes which are regarded as कित् though not actually having a क् to mark them as such. The terminations of लिट् (Perfect) not being पित् terminations, are कित्, after verbs that have no compound consonants. The phrase अपित् (not being marked with प्) qualifies this <i>sutra</i> also, being drawn from the previous <i>sutra</i> by the rule of <i>Anuvritti</i>.

Thus from भिद् 'to tear' the Reduplicated non <i>pit</i> second person perfect is बिभिदतुः 'thou hast torn.' बिभिदुः 'They have torn.'
Similarly चिच्छिदतुः 'thou hast divided'; चिच्छिदुः 'you divided'; ईजतुः and ईजुः.

This rule will not apply if the root ends in a conjunct consonant. Thus स्रंस् 'to fall down' forms its second person Perfect :- सस्रंस् + अतुस् = सस्रंसतुः. Here the affix is not treated as <i>kit</i>; for had it been so treated, it would have caused the elision of the penultimate nasal (<i>anusvara</i>) of स्रंस by Rule [[6.4.24]]. Similarly from ध्वंस् we have दध्वंसे.

The <i>pit</i> terminations of the Perfect are not <i>kit</i>; and therefore we have बिभेद 'he has divided,' where the root is <i>gunated</i> before the 3rd person singular termination णल् which is a पित् termination, because it being the substitute of तिप् is regarded like तिप् by [[1.1.56]].
