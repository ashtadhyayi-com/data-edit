The affixes क्त्वा and सन् [[3.1.7]] are कित् after रुद् 'to weep', विद् 'to know', मुष् 'to steal', गृह् 'to seize', स्वप् 'to sleep' and प्रच्छ् 'to ask'. 
After the above mentioned verbs the <i>ktva</i> though taking an intermediate इ, and the affix सन् are कित्. The affix सन् is employed in forming desiderative verbs. The न् of सन् is इत्, the real affix being स. The root is reduplicated before this सन् affix. Thus रुदित्वा 'having cried,' रुरुदिषति 'he wishes to cry'; विदित्वा 'having known,' विविदिषति 'he wishes to know'; गृहीत्वा [[6.1.16]] 'having taken,' जिघृक्षति 'he wishes to take'; मुषित्वा 'having stolen,' मुमुषिषति 'he wishes to steal'; सुप्त्वा [[6.1.15]] 'having slept,' सुषुप्सति 'he wishes to sleep,' पृष्ट्वा [[6.1.16]] 'having asked' पिपृच्छिषति 'he wishes to ask.' The verb ग्रह् is changed into गृह्, स्वप् into सुप्, प्रच्छ् into पृच्छ before <i>kit</i> affixes by <i>samprasarana</i> [[6.1.16]]

The <i>ktva</i> and <i>san</i> would have been optionally <i>kit</i> after the verbs रुद्, विद् and मुष् by virtue of Rule 26 of this chapter, but this <i>sutra</i> makes them necessarily so, after these three verbs. In the case of the verb ग्रह्, these affixes are <i>kit</i> by virtue of this <i>sutra</i> only. In the case of the verbs स्वप् and प्रच्छ् the affix क्त्वा is of course <i>kit</i>, because these two verbs are <i>anit</i>, that is, they do not take the intermediate इ; and therefore the क्त्वा being directly affixed to them, and rule 18 not applying, the indicatory k would make it <i>kit</i>. In reference to these verbs, therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> teaches something new, only with regard to the affix सन्, by making that also <i>kit</i>. The verb प्रच्छ् takes the intermediate इ when the affix सन् follows, by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.75]].
