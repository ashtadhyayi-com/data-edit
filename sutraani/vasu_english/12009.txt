The affix सन् beginning with a letter of the प्रत्यहार झल् is like कित् after the verbs ending in इक् vowels.
In this <i>sutra</i> there is the <i>anuvritti</i> of सन् only and not of क्त्वा. The <i>sutra</i> literally translated means:-"After <i>ik</i> the <i>jhal</i>." The <i>Pratyahara</i> इक् contains the four letters इ, उ, ऋ, लृ. The <i>Pratyahara</i> झल् contains all the consonants, except the nasals and the liquids. After the verbs ending in इक् the desiderative suffix सन् is <i>kit</i>, when it is झलादि, that is to say when the affix सन् does not take the intermediate इ. The affix सन् is an affix which begins with स् a letter of the झल् class. But if the intermediate इ is added before it, it is no longer a झलादि affix, and in that case it is not कित्. Thus from जि 'to conquer,' which is a verb ending in इक्, we have जिगीषति 'he wishes to conquer', यु 'to mix' युयूषति; so also कृ 'to do,' चिकीर्षति, तृ 'to cross' तितीर्षति, भू 'to be' बुभूषति ।

If however, verbs ending in इ or उ or ऋ or लृ, take an intermediate इ, they likewise take <i>guna</i>. As:- स्मि 'to smile' takes <i>guna</i>, and makes its desiderative सिस्मयिषति.

The झलादि सन् is not <i>kit</i> after verbs ending in any other letter than the इक्. As पिपासति (from पा) 'he wishes to drink.' So from स्था we have तिष्ठासति.

The object of making the affix सन् <i>kit</i> affix after verbs ending in <i>ik</i> vowels, is to prevent the <i>guna</i> of the vowel of the root, as in चिचीषति 'wishes to collect', तुष्टूषति 'wishes to praise.' To this it might be objected "this cannot be : for rule [[6.4.16]] (when सन् beginning with a <i>jhal</i>, i.e., not preceded by the augment इट् follows, a long vowel is the substitute of verbs ending in a vowel, and of the verbs हन् and गम्) would prevent <i>guna</i> by substituting long vowel." To this it may be replied: "if rule [[6.4.16]], enjoining long vowel, debars rule [[7.3.84]] requiring <i>guna</i>, it should a fortiori debar rule [[6.4.51]] which requires the elision of the affix णि before <i>Ardhadhatuka</i> affixes not taking the augment इट्. But evidently that is not so; for the elision of णि is not debarred by [[6.4.16]]. Therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> is made, so that even by giving scope to the rule of lengthening, the affix सन् be treated as कित्." Thus in चिचीषति scope is given to rule [[6.4.16]], and the vowel is lengthened. But this rule in its turn will be debarred in those cases where rule [[6.4.51]] will apply : in such cases the maxim contained in [[1.4.2]] is our guide, and a subsequent rule will debar a prior rule of <i>Panini</i> when both find their scope in a single case. Thus in forming the desiderative of the verb ज्ञप् 'to inform,' both the rules [[6.4.16]] and [[6.4.51]] present themselves, but the latter prevails. The verb ज्ञप् belongs to the <i>churadi</i> class of verbs, and takes the affix णिच्. Thus ज्ञप् + णिच् + सन् + तिप्; here the present <i>sutra</i> comes into force, and सन् being treated as कित्, the <i>guna</i> of the इ of ज्ञपि is prevented. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.84]] requiring <i>guna</i> being set aside, <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.51]] comes into play, and causes the elision of णिच् and we have ज्ञप् + स + ति = ज्ञीप्सति [[7.4.55]] (आ changed to ई) 'he wishes to inform.'
