Optionally after the verb गम् , the लिङ् and the सिच् beginning with झल् consonants, in the आत्मनेपद , are कित्।
The verb गम् 'to go' is <i>Atmanepadi</i> after the preposition सम् by Rule [[1.3.29]].

The result of its being <i>kit</i> is that the nasal is dropped in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, in forming the Aorist with सिच्, and the Bencdictive. Thus we have the forms :- संगंसीष्ट or संगसीष्ट in the Benedictive; and समगत or समगंस्त in the <i>sich</i> Aorist. These forms are thus evolved :-

सम्  + गम् + सीष्ट = सम् + ग + सीष्ट [[6.4.37]] = संगसीष्ट 'may he combine.' Here the nasal म् of गम् is elided by treating the affix सीष्ट as कित् by Rule [[6.4.37]]. In the alternative we have संगंसीष्ट.

So in the aorist सम् + गम् + सिच् + त = सम् + अट् + गम् + त [[6.4.37]] = समगत. The सिच् being elided by [[8.2.27]] (after a short inflective base, there is elision of सिच्, if a <i>jhal</i> follows). So when म् of गम् is elided by [[6.4.37]], there remains only ग which is a base ending in short अ, hence, the elision of सिच्. But in the alternative we have समगंस्त.
