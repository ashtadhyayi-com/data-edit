The सिच् आत्मनेपद affixes are कित् after the root हन् 'to kill'.
As आहत, आहसाताम्, आहसत are the aorist of हन्. When a सिच् or second aorist is <i>kit</i> the verb loses its nasal, by Rule [[6.4.37]]. After the verb हन् the सिच् is only <i>kit</i> and not the Benedictive लिङ् terminations, as was the case in the previous <i>sutra</i>; hence the repetition of the word <i>sich</i> in this <i>sutra</i>. The <i>sutras</i> [[1.2.12]] and [[1.2.13]] were governed both by लिङ् and सिच्; from and after this <i>sutra</i>, the governing power of लिङ् ceases. The governing power of the word "<i>Atmanepada</i>" in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.11]] does not however cease, and its <i>anuvritti</i> runs through the succeeding <i>sutras</i>; though as regards this <i>sutra</i>, its <i>anuvritti</i> is redundant, in as much as before the <i>Parasmaipada</i> terminations, the root हन् is always replaced by वध् in the aorist, there is no necessity of making the affix <i>sich</i> a <i>kit</i>. For the object served in making <i>sich</i>, <i>kit</i>, after the verb हन्, is to elide the nasal, while in the case of वध्, no such purpose can be served.
