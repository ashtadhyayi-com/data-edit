The affix सिच् before आत्मनेपद affixes is कित् after the verb यम् when meaning 'to divulge'.
The word <i>gandhana</i> means 'to divulge,' 'to make known that which had been concealed.' The verb यम् has various meanings.

The result of <i>kit</i> is that the nasal is elided. The verb यम् becomes <i>Atmanepada</i> when preceded by the preposition आङ् by rule (1.3. 28). Thus उत् + आ + यम् + त = उदायत = 'he divulged,' उदायसाताम्, उदायसत, the <i>sich</i> is elided by [[8.2.27]] and म् by [[6.4.37]]. When the verb यम् has any other meaning than 'to divulge,' then the सिच् in the <i>Atmanepada</i> is not <i>kit</i>; as उदायंस्त पादस् 'he raised the foot.' So also उदायंस्त कूपादुदकम् 'he raised water from the well.' Though here the verb <i>yam</i> is in the transitive form and takes an object after it, yet it is <i>Atmanepadi</i> by Rule [[1.3.75]] which declares "after the verb <i>yam</i> to strive, preceded by सम्, उत् and आङ् when it does not refer to a book, the <i>Atmanepada</i> is employed."
