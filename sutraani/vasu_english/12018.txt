The affix क्त्वा when it takes the augment इट् (i.e. when it is सेट्) is not कित् ।
We had had occasion to refer to this <i>sutra</i> in explaining <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.7]]. The affix <i>ktva</i> (the actual affix being <i>tva</i>, the <i>k</i> being merely <i>it</i> or indicatory letter) is on the face of it a <i>kit</i> affix. This <i>sutra</i> however limits its <i>kitness</i> to cases where it is not <i>set</i>. If it is <i>set</i>, i.e. has before it the intermediate इ it will not be treated like a <i>kit</i> affix. Thus in कृत्वा, हुत्वा, the affix त्वा is added directly to the root कृ 'to do' and हु 'to sacrifice,' without an intermediate इ and therefore the root has not been <i>gunated</i>, the affix here being <i>kit</i>. But in स्वेदित्वा, देवित्वा, वर्त्तित्वा, from स्विद्, दिव् and वृत् 'to sweat,' 'to shine,' 'to be,' the affix is not <i>kit</i>, because there is an intermediate इ before त्वा and the root has been consequently <i>gunated</i>.

Of course this <i>sutra</i> relates to क्त्वा <i>ktva</i> only. Other affixes though having an intermediate इ will be treated as <i>kit</i>, if they have an indicatory क्. Thus the affix क्तिन् [[3.3.94]] by which feminine nouns are formed from roots is a कित् affix. This affix when सेट्, will remain कित्, as नि + ग्रह् + इट् + क्तिन् = नि + गृह् + इ + ति [[6.1.16]] = निगृहीतिः [[7.2.37]]. Here there is <i>samprasarana</i> by treating <i>klin</i> as <i>kit</i>. So also in उपस्निहितिः and निकुचितिः there is no <i>guna</i>. After ग्रह् &c., the affix क्तिन् takes the augment इट् by a <i>Vartika</i> under <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.9]] which see.
