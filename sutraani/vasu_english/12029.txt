The vowel that is perceived as having a high tone is called उदात्त or acutely accented.
With this <i>sutra</i> begins the description of the three sorts of vowel accents. The accent placed on a vowel by raising the voice is called <i>udatta</i> or acute accent. As अग्निः <i>agnih</i>, here <i>i</i> has the acute accent. The <i>udatta</i> is not marked in writing. The word 'vowel' of the previous <i>sutra</i> is understood in this also. These accents are the qualities of letters, and are well known in the sacred and secular literature. The vowel which is perceived as having a high tone is called <i>udatta</i>. This tone depends upon the organ from which the vowel is pronounced. In the various organs, such as the throat, palate, &c., if a vowel is pronounced from a higher part of that organ, it is called <i>udatta</i>. The vowel in the pronouncing of which there is the restraining and checking of the bodily parts, and in which there is dryness and roughness of tone as well as a contraction of the larynx, is said to have the acute accent. The word is used in <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.3]] \[1\] "The first vowel of an affix has the <i>udatta</i> accent." As कृ + तव्यम् = कर्तव्यम् <i>kartavyam</i>.
