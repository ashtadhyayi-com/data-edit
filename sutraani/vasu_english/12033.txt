In addressing a person from a distance the tone is called एकश्रुति or monotony.
Monotony or <i>Ekasruti</i> is that tone which is perceived when a person is addressed; in it there is an absence of all the three tones mentioned above; and there is no definite pitch in it. It is, therefore, the ordinary recitative tone.

The word '<i>Sambuddhi</i>' means here addressing a person from a distance; and has not its technical meaning of the singular number of the vocative case. As आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्ता३ '<i>O</i> boy <i>Devadatta</i>! come.' There is vanishing of all the accents in the above case; and the final short vowel of <i>Devadatta</i> is changed into <i>pluta</i> by the rule already referred to in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.28]] <i>ante</i> ([[8.2.84]] दूराद्धूतेच) ॥

If the person is not addressed from a distance, then the word will get its proper accent. As आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्त 'come, O boy <i>Devadatta</i>.'
