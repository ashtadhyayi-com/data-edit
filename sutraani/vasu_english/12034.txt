In sacrificial works there is Monotony, except in जप (silent repetition of a formula), न्यूङ्ख vowels (16 sorts of ओम्) and the साम Vedas.
In "sacrificial works" or on occasions of sacrifice, the <i>mantras</i> of the <i>Veda</i> are recited in <i>Ekasruti</i> or monotony. But on occasions of ordinary reading, the <i>mantras</i> are to be recited with their proper three-fold accents.

"<i>Japa</i>" is the repetition of <i>mantras</i>, and their recitation in a low voice or whisper. <i>Nyunkha</i> is the name of certain hymns of the <i>veda</i>, and the names of 16 sorts of "<i>Om</i>." Some of these are pronounced with <i>udatta</i> and others with <i>anudatta</i> accent. <i>Samas</i> are songs, or the musical cadence in which some vedic hymns are to be uttered. As:- अ॒ग्निर्मूद्धादि॒वः क॒कुत्पतिः॑ पृथि॒व्या अ॒यम् । अपाम् रेतांसि जिन्वतो३ म् (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VIII.14.16).

When a <i>mantra</i> is recited as a <i>japa</i>, then it must be pronounced with accents :- As समा॑ग्ने वर्चो॑ विह॒वेष्वं॑स्तु (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> X. 128. I).

When not employed on occasions of sacrifice, but are ordinarily read, the <i>mantras</i> must have their proper accent, and there will be no <i>Ekasruti</i>.

In the <i>sama</i> chanting, the <i>mantras</i> should have their accent, there can be no <i>Ekasruti</i> there. As ए३विस्वं समत्रिणं दहा३. Here there is no <i>Ekasruti</i>.
