The pronunciation of the word वषट् , may optionally be by raising the voice (acutely accented), or it may be pronounced with monotony.
The phrase "<i>yajna</i>-<i>karma</i>" is understood here. Even in <i>yajna</i>-<i>karmas</i> or sacrifices the word वौषट् may optionally be pronounced in a raised tone. The word वषट् in the <i>sutra</i> signifies वौषट्. But why was not the word वौषट् used in the text? It could have been used with as much case as वषट्. To this natural query, the only answer is, विचित्राः हि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः strange and wonderful is the structure of <i>Panini</i>'s aphorisms, Thus सोमस्याग्ने वीही३ वौ३ षट् or सोमस्याग्ने वीही३ वौ३ षट्.
