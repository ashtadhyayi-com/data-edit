The monotony is optional in the recitation of the Vedas or they may be recited with accents.
In the <i>Chhandas</i> or the Vedas there is option either to use the <i>Ekasruti</i> tone or the three tones. Even on the occasion of ordinary reading, the <i>Chhandas</i> might be uttered either with the three accents or monotonously. Some say this is a limited option (<i>vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>).

The option allowed by this <i>sutra</i> is to be adjusted in this way. In reading the <i>Mantra</i> portion of the <i>Veda</i>, every word must be pronounced with its proper accent: but in the <i>Brahmana</i> portion of the <i>Veda</i> there might be <i>Ekasruti</i>; while some say there must be <i>Ekasruti</i> necessarily and not optionally in the recitation of the <i>Brahmanas</i>.

Thus:- अ॒ग्निमी॑ले पु॒रोहि॑तं or simply अग्निमीले पुरोहितं. "I praise <i>Agni</i> the <i>purohita</i>."

The word वा "optionally" of the last <i>sutra</i> could easily have been read into this <i>sutra</i> by the rule of <i>anuvritti</i>; why then use the word विभाषा "optional" again ? To this we reply, this apparently redundant repetition is for the sake of indicating that the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word यज्ञकर्मणि, which was understood in the last <i>sutra</i>, does not extend to this. Had we taken the <i>anuvritti</i> of वा, the other word also would have been attracted; hence the separate use of the word विभाषा.
