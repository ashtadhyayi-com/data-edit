In (this book, in the sūtras relating to) compound, the word that is exhibited in the Nominative -1st case, is called उपसर्जन or the secondary word.
This defines or rather describes the <i>Upasarjana</i>. In the <i>sutras</i> referring to compounds, the words that have the case termination of the nominative, are called <i>Upasarjanam</i>.

Thus <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.24]] (द्वितीया श्रितातीत पतितगतात्यस्तप्राप्तापन्नैः) is a <i>samasa</i> <i>sutra</i> enjoining composition. In this <i>sutra</i> the word द्वितीया is exhibited in the nominative case, and the remaining words are in the Instrumental case. The <i>sutra</i> means: "An accusative (द्वितीया) is compounded with the words श्रित, अतीत, पतित, गत, अत्यस्त, प्राप्त, and आपन्न and forms <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i>". Therefore, in forming accusative compounds, the word having the accusative case will be called <i>Upasarjana</i>. Thus कष्टं + श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः. Here the word कष्टं being <i>Upasarjana</i>, stands first in the compound, by Rule [[2.2.30]]. उपसर्जनं पूर्वम्, (in a compound the <i>Upasarjana</i> should be placed first). Similarly in rules relating to the formation of instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive and locative <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i>, the words standing in those cases will be <i>Upasarjana</i>. Thus शंकुलाखण्डः, यूपदारु, वृकभयम्, राजपुरुषः, अक्षशौण्डः.

<i>Upasarjana</i> is, therefore, that word which either by composition or derivation loses its original independent character, while it also determines the sense of another word called प्रधान or principal.
