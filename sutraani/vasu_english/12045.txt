A significant form of a word, not being a verbal root (धातु), or an affix (प्रत्यय) is called a प्रातिपदिक or crude-form.
This defines the word "<i>pratipadika</i>" or crude-form. The <i>pratipadika</i> is the intermediate stage in the development of a full word (<i>pada</i>), from the undifferentiated ore called the <i>dhatu</i> or root. It is that part of a word which is capable of receiving the case-terminations.

The word अर्थ means having signification. With the exception of verbal roots and affixes, a word-form having a significance or meaning is called a <i>pratipadika</i>, as डित्थः 'a wooden elephant,' कपित्थ 'the wood-apple tree,' कुण्डम् 'a bowl,' पीठम् 'a seat.':

Why do we say "significant"? Of course it must have some meaning. Thus of the word वनं, we cannot say that the portion वन् is <i>pratipadika</i>; as it has no meaning, and had it been a <i>pratipadika</i>, the final न् would have been dropped by Rule [[8.2.7]] \[1\] (the final न् of a <i>pratipadika</i> is dropped).

The word must not be a verb, as the word अहन् (the third person sing. number, imperfect tense of हन्) he killed. Had it been a <i>pratipadika</i>, the न् would have been dropped.

The word must not be an affix or ending in an affix:-as कुण्डे 'in the bowl.' Here the word ends in the affix इ of the locative case, and is consequently not a '<i>pratipadika</i>' or crude form, but a complete word. Had it been a <i>pratipadika</i>, the ए would have been shortened into इ by rule 47 succeeding.

A <i>nipata</i> or particle though not a significant form of a word, yet gets the designation of <i>pratipadika</i> in the opinion of the author of the <i>Mahabhashya</i>. As अध्यागच्छति, प्रलम्बते.
