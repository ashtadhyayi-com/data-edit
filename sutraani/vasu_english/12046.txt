The forms ending कृत् affixes or तद्धित affixes, or compound are also called प्रातिपदिक।
This further explains the use of the word <i>pratipadika</i>. "Suffixes for the formation of nouns are of two kinds. Those by which nouns are derived direct from roots, primary suffixes. Those by which nouns are derived from other nouns, secondary suffixes. The former are called <i>Krit</i>, [[3.1.93]] \[1\], the latter <i>Taddhita</i> [[4.1.76]] \[2\]. Thus जन <i>jana</i>, man, is derived from the root जन् <i>jan</i> by the <i>krit</i> suffix अ; but जनीन <i>janina</i>, appropriate for man, is derived from जन <i>jana</i> by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix ईन <i>ina</i>. The name <i>pratipadika</i> would apply both to जन <i>jana</i> and जनीन <i>janina</i>, as nominal bases ready to receive the terminations of declension" (Max Muller).

Of the compounds, of which there are six varieties, we had occasion to refer to five already, viz. <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i>, <i>Karmadharaya</i>, <i>Dvandva</i>, <i>Bahuvrihi</i> and <i>Avyayibhava</i>. They will be fully dealt with in their proper places.
 
In the last <i>sutra</i>, the words "not ending in an affix" were too extensive; this <i>sutra</i> makes an important provision in favour of words ending in <i>Krit</i> or <i>Taddhita</i> affixes. So also compounds are also called <i>pratipadika</i>. Being restricted to compounds only, it, of course, does not apply to sentences.

The words formed by <i>krit</i> affixes are <i>pratipadika</i>, as कृ (to do) + ण्वुल् = कृ + वु = कार् + अक = कारक. The affix ण्वुल् is a <i>krit</i> affix, and it is added to the root to form agent by Rule [[3.1.133]] \[3\]. The letters ण् and ल् are indicatory, the force of ण् being to cause the <i>vridhi</i> of the vowel of the root. The real affix वु is changed into अक by [[7.1.1]] \[4\]. the affixes यु and वु are replaced by अन and अक respectively. Thus the form कारक is a <i>pratipadika</i>, and is capable of declension by receiving case terminations, as कारकः ॥ Similarly कृ + तृच् [[3.1.133]] \[5\] = कर्तृ; nom. case कर्ता.

The word formed by <i>Taddhita</i> affixes are also <i>pratipadika</i>; उपगु + अण् = औपगो + अ = औपगव 'the son of the <i>Rishi</i> <i>Upagu</i>': nom. case औपगवः. Similarly कापटवः.

In fact in the chapters treating of these affixes, the derivative substantives formed by them are always shown by the Indian Grammarians in the nominative case singular number. The examples of nouns given in this book will be always declined nouns and not <i>pratipadikas</i>, except in peculiar cases. So also in the chapter of <i>samasa</i> or compounds.

The words ending in compound are <i>pratipadika</i>: as राज्ञः + पुरुषः = राजपुरुषः, nom. case राजपुरुषः.
