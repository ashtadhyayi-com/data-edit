When a तद्धित affix is elided by using the word लुप् , then the gender and number (of the derivative word) agree with those of the original word.
This <i>sutra</i> consists of four words: 1. लुपि, 'where there is a rejection by using लुप्'; 2. युक्तवत् 'appropriate to the same;' 3. व्यक्ति 'gender;' 4. वचनं 'number.' The form <i>vyakti</i> <i>vachane</i> is dual.

When a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is <i>luped</i>, then the derivative word retains the gender and number of the primitive word. Note the difference between the rejection of a <i>Taddhita</i> by saying 'let there be a लुक्' and 'let there be a लुप्' ॥ The direct action of both words is the rejection of the suffix; but a derivative formed by <i>luk</i> rejection may not retain the number and gender of the original word; while a derivative formed by <i>lup</i> rejection does retain the number and gender of the original word.

Thus in the secondary derivative word शिरीषाः, meaning 'a village not far away from शिरीष trees', the masculine gender and plural number of the original word has been retained, though made applicable to a village, which is in the singular number and neuter gender; similarly the word पंचालाः is masculine plural in form though applicable to a single province.

This <i>sutra</i> is not an approved rule; as will be mentioned by <i>Panini</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.53]] following and is consequently of little practical importance.

Thus पंचालाः are a class of <i>Kshatriyas</i>. As such it is masculine gender and plural number. The country in which <i>Panchalas</i> live is also called <i>Panchalas</i>; similarly कुरवः, मागधाः &c. There is a rule जनपदेलुप् ([[4.2.81]], the <i>lup</i> takes the place of an affix when signifying the proper name of a country or kingdom). Thus पंचालाः + अण् (this is one of the affixes forming country) = पंचालाः.

This rule does not apply when the affix is suppressed by the word लुक् &c. and not लुप्. Thus लवणः सूपः 'salted soup', लवणायवागुः 'salted gruel,' लवणं शाकं 'salted vegetable.' Here the affix उक् has been elided by the word <i>luk</i>, by [[4.4.24]]. लवणाल्लुक् (after the word <i>lavana</i> the affix is <i>luked</i>).

These derivatives retain only the gender and number of the original, but no other quality. Thus as we have already seen that शिरीषाः, <i>sirishah</i>, is the name of a village and is formed by the <i>lup</i> of the affix. Now compounding it with वन we have शिरीषवनम्, 'the forest of the village <i>Sirisha</i>.' Here the word शिरीषाः means village, and not trees. Had it meant trees called <i>sirisha</i>, then the न of वन would have become  ण optionally by Rule [[8.4.6]]. (विभाषौषधि वनस्पतिभ्यः ॥ The न of the word वन is optionally changed into ण when preceded by words signifying annual herbs and trees).

Vart:- In the case of the words <i>Haritaki</i> &c., the gender only is retained and not the number. As हरीतक्य फलानि 'the fruits of <i>Haritaki</i>. Here फलं is neuter in form, while हरीतकी is feminine.

Vart:- The words खलतिक &c. retain their number only but not gender, as खलतिकंवनानि 'mountain forests, i.e. forests in the vicinity of mountains.' Here खलतिकं is singular and वनानि plural, but the gender of both is the same viz. neuter.
