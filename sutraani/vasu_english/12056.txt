(Nor need be taught) the rule relating to the dependance of the meaning of a word on the principal (प्रधान in a compound) or on the affix (प्रत्यय) because the authority of the meaning (of a word, compound or derivative) consists in something else.
This <i>sutra</i> may be divided into two parts. The first part stating the proposition and ending with the word <i>vachanam</i>. The second part giving the reason. The first part consists of four words; <i>Pradhana</i>: 'Principal in a compound.' As in the compound राजपुरुषः 'king's man,' the word <i>raja</i> is <i>Upasarjana</i>; and पुरुषः is <i>pradhana</i>. 2. <i>Pratyaya</i>: 'affix.' 3. 'meaning.' 4. वचनम् 'word or sentence.'

In the time of <i>Panini</i>, there were some grammarians who held the opinion, that the meaning of a word is determined, if a compound word, then by its principal word; and if a derivative word, then by the suffix. <i>Panini</i> controverts this opinion by declaring that in as much as the meaning of a word is fixed by usage and idiom, therefore the proofs for the meaning of a word are not to be searched either in the affixes which go to form it; or by its principal word, if it is a compound. Because, says <i>Panini</i>, the proof of the meaning of a word is in something else, that is to say in the usage of a people and not in the suffixes, &c. A person who has never heard the name of grammar, understands full well when told to bring a <i>Raja</i>-<i>purusha</i>. He brings an official and not a king, nor even any person in general. Similarly when told to bring an औपगव he brings a cowherd's child, not a cowherd, nor a child in general, nor both. When, therefore, the sense of a word is determined by usage, there is no use to strive to find out the sense by grammatical rules.
