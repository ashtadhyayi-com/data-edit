In (a common) name (expressive of) class, in denoting the singular, the plural is optionally used.
The words of this <i>sutra</i> require some detailed explanation. The name of a <i>jati</i> or species, always denotes one, since it is a collective noun, and will naturally take the singular number; by the present <i>sutra</i> such words may take the plural number also. In such nouns of class, the plural number has also the force of the singular. The <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>asishyam</i> does not go further.

It follows from this that adjectives which are not themselves common noun, such as संपन्नः &c., agree with the noun and will also get the plural number. Thus संपन्नो यवः or संपन्ना यवाः; "Full grown barley" पूर्ववया ब्राह्मणः प्रत्युत्येयः or पूर्ववयसो ब्राह्मणाः प्रत्युत्येयाः ॥ Why have we used the word <i>jati</i> in this <i>sutra</i> ? For this aphorism does not apply to Proper Nouns. Thus देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i>, यज्ञदत्तः <i>Yajnadatta</i>.

Why have we used the word आख्यायाम्? A word may be a class noun or <i>jati</i>, but it may not be the appellation of a class. Thus the statue of <i>Kasyapa</i> may also be called <i>kasyapa</i>; this is a class noun; but as it is not the appellation आख्या or name of a class, such words cannot take the plural form and still denote a singular sense.

Why do we say '<i>ekasmin</i>'? When two or more class names are compounded as ब्रीहियवौ 'the rice and barley': the rule does not apply.

Vart:- An exception must be made when a class noun is qualified by a numeral adjective. As एको ब्रीहिः संपन्नः सुभिक्षं करोति.
