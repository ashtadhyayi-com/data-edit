The plural of the pronoun अस्मद् 'I', is used optionally, though the sense requires a singular or a dual number.
Thus "I speak" or "we speak" (अहं ब्रवीमि or वयं बुमः), may be spoken by one person; similarly two persons may either use the dual case or the plural case; thus आवां ब्रूवः 'we two speak' or वयं ब्रूमः 'we speak.'

Vart:- There is prohibition when the pronoun of the Ist person is qualified by an attribute :- as अहं देवदत्तो ब्रवीमि, 'I <i>Devadatta</i> am speaking.' अहं गार्ग्यो ब्रवीमि, 'I <i>Gargya</i> am saying.' Here we cannot use the plural.

Vart:- The word गुरु 'master' may have plural form though referring to one person, when following the word युष्मद्; as त्वं मे गुरुः or यूयं मे गुरवः, 'Thou art my master,' or 'you are my master.'
