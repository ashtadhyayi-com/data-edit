And the dual of फाल्गुनी and प्रष्ठपदा , when signifying asterisms, (also connotes optionally plural).
The word च in this aphorism draws in the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्वयः from the last. Of the stars <i>phalguni</i> and <i>proshthapada</i>, the forms may be either dual or plural. As उदिते पूर्वे फल्गुन्यौ (dual); or उदिताः पूर्वाः फल्गुन्यः (plural.) So also पूर्वे प्रोष्ठपदे or पूर्वाः प्रोष्ठपदः ॥  There are two pairs of stars of the name of <i>phalguni</i> and <i>proshthapada</i>, both being of feminine gender, and their logical number being 'dual.' The present <i>sutra</i> ordains plural optionally. If <i>phalguni</i> and <i>proshthapada</i> are not names of asterisms, they must have their proper number : as फल्गुन्यौ माणविके ॥
