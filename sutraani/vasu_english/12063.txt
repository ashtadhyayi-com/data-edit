In the द्वन्द compounds of the stars तिष्व and पुनर्वसू , the dual constantly comes in place of the plural.
When there is a collective compounding of the words <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasu</i> (meaning two groups of stars), the final compound is always in the dual. Thus उदितौ तिष्यपुनर्वसूदृश्येते 'the <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasu</i> having risen are seen (dual).'

There is one star called <i>Tishya</i>; and there are two stars called <i>Punarvasu</i>. As the <i>Dvandva</i> compound of these stars refers to more than two stars, it ought to have been in the plural number. This rule teaches that there should be a dual number, where otherwise there would have been a plural number. Why do we say '<i>Tishya</i>' and '<i>Punarvasu</i>'? Observe विशाखानुराधाः 'the stars <i>Visakha</i> and <i>Anuradha</i>.' The compound is in plural number.

This rule would not apply if these words do not connote stars but are used in any other sense. As तिष्यपुनर्वसवो माणवकाः, 'Boys called <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasus</i>.'

Why is the word 'star' repeated in the <i>sutra</i>, when the previous <i>sutras</i> and the context show that stars were being treated of. The repetition is for the sake of including the synonyms of <i>Tishya</i> and <i>Punarvasu</i>. As तिष्यपुनर्वसू; पुष्यपुनर्वसू, सिद्धपुनर्वसू ॥

The rule only applies when these words form a <i>Dvandva</i> compound, and not when they are compounded in any other way. Thus तिष्यपुनर्वसवः is an example of <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound meaning "persons who confound the <i>Tishya</i> with the <i>Punarvasu</i>."

The rule only applies to the plural <i>Dvandva</i>. If the <i>Dvandva</i> takes the singular termination, this rule has no application. As तिष्यपुनर्वसू इदमिति.

This <i>sutra</i> indicates by implication (<i>jnapaka</i>) that "every <i>Dvandva</i> compound may optionally take the terminations of the singular" for otherwise the employment of the term बहुवचनस्य in the <i>sutra</i> would be superfluous.

The word 'always' has been used in the text to show that the governing power of "option" stops here with this <i>sutra</i> and does not extend to it or any further.
