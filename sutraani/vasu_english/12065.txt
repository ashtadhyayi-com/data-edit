The वृद्ध (or patronymic गोत्र word becomes एकशेष and is retained, when compounded) with a patronymic word युवन् , provided that the specific difference in form between them be in their signs (affix) only.
The word <i>sesha</i> of the previous <i>sutra</i> is understood here. The word "<i>yuna</i>" in the text is in the instrumental case. The <i>yuvan</i> word is dropped when read along with a <i>Vriddha</i> word. The word <i>Vriddha</i> means <i>gotra</i>: the old <i>acharyas</i> (grammarians) used the word <i>Vriddha</i> for <i>gotra</i>. The <i>vriddha</i> (or in other words, the gotra) word designates a person between whom and original head of the family a son (or a word formed by an <i>apatya</i> affix) intervenes. In using together two words, one formed by a <i>gotra</i> affix and the other by a <i>yuvan</i> affix, the <i>Vriddha</i> is retained, where the difference between those words is in their affixes only. These two words, <i>gotra</i> and <i>yuvan</i>, are defined in <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.162]] and [[4.1.163]]. (अपत्यं पौत्रप्रभृति गोत्रम् ॥ जीवति तु वंश्ये युवा) ॥ Roughly speaking a <i>gotra</i> word is formed from the original noun which is the name of the head of the family when a son of such person is living; and a <i>vriddha</i> word represents thus a grandson, or lower than that, but not a son; while a <i>yuvan</i> word is derived from such last mentioned <i>gotra</i> word by another affix and thus represents persons lower than grandsons.

The word '<i>tad</i>' in the <i>sutra</i> refers to the <i>gotra</i> and <i>yuvan</i> affixes. The word <i>lakshana</i> 'sign' in the <i>sutra</i> is synonymous with 'cause' or 'occasion'; meaning the specific difference is caused or occasioned by the <i>gotra</i> and <i>yuvan</i> affixes. The word चेत् in the <i>sutra</i> means 'if.' The word एव 'only' is used to exclude others. The word विशेषः in the <i>sutra</i> means the 'dissimilarity of form.'

Thus गार्ग्यः + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here the first word denotes a clan called <i>Gargya</i> (the offspring or grandsons of <i>Garga</i> formed by the affix यञ् [[4.1.105]] \[1\] the second word denotes a younger branch of the same, and is formed by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix denoting a secondary derivative \[2\]. In this then, the first or "<i>Vriddha</i>" remains; the second or the <i>yuvan</i> is dropped; and the form "<i>Gargyau</i>" means both the old and the new clan. Similarly वात्स्यः + वात्स्यायनः = वात्स्यौ ॥

This <i>Ekasesha</i> is to be done only in those cases, where the two words have the same radical form, the only difference between them being in their derivative formation.

The words must differ only by their affixes, but their radical element must be the same. The rule therefore does not apply to:- गार्ग्यः (a <i>Vriddha</i> word + वात्स्यायनः (a <i>yuvan</i> word) = गार्ग्यवात्स्यायनौ ॥

This rule of <i>ekasesha</i> does not apply if one of the words be not a <i>Vriddha</i> word. Thus गर्गः + गार्ग्यायणः = गर्गगार्ग्यायणौ ॥

Similarly vice versa गार्ग्यः + गर्गः = गार्ग्यगर्गौ । Here the one word is <i>Vriddha</i>, but the other is not <i>yuvan</i>.

The word "only" is used in the <i>sutra</i> in an exclusive sense, the force being, that two words may stand in the relation of <i>Vriddha</i> and <i>yuvan</i>, their radical element, i.e. form may be the same; but if the secondary word has another sense over and above the sense of a <i>yuvan</i> affix, this rule is not applicable. Thus rule [[4.1.148]] \[3\] says a "<i>Vriddha</i> word may optionally take the affix ठक् to form a <i>yuvan</i> word and to indicate contempt and born in the country of <i>Sauvira</i>." Thus भागवित्तिः + भागवित्तिकः = भागवित्तिभागवित्तिकौ. Here the second word, though a <i>yuvan</i> word, connotes the additional sense of contempt and degradation. The affix ठक् is not merely a <i>yuvan</i> affix but conveys the other sense also, the pure <i>yuvan</i> word being भागवित्तायनः.

N. B.- The system of domestic economy among the ancient <i>Aryas</i> was considerably difterent from the prevalent one. The surnames or the <i>gotras</i> represented the patriarchal system. Three forms of surnames are constantly met with in ancient literature. The first was most important: it was the patronymic by which the lord of the united family, the patriarch, was known. For example, <i>Garga</i> or <i>Gargacharya</i> was the recognised head of all the <i>Gargas</i> who may be a hundred. His eldest son and heir was called <i>Gargi</i>. This is the first form of the patronymic (<i>apatya</i>). The grandsons or sons of <i>Gargi</i> were named <i>Gargyas</i> (<i>Vriddham</i> or <i>Gotra</i>). On the decease of the old patriarch, <i>Gargi</i> began to be called <i>Garga</i>; and the eldest of the grandsons was called <i>Gargi</i>; and those great-grandsons who belonged to the family, and were designated <i>Gargayanas</i> (<i>yuvan</i>) were now called <i>Gargyas</i>.
