And so also a feminine word, ending with a वृद्ध affix, when similarly spoken along with the same word but which ends with a युवन् affix, is only retained and it is treated like a masculine.
When a word denoting <i>gotra</i> and in the feminine gender is compounded with another word denoting a <i>yuvan</i>, the first is retained and the last is dropped; and the feminine noun so remaining is then treated like the masculine. This aphorism makes an addition to the previous <i>sutra</i> and is governed by all the conditions mentioned in that <i>sutra</i>. Thus गर्गी + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here note that the resultant form is the same as in the former <i>sutra</i>, namely the masculine.

Similarly दाक्षी + दाक्षायणः = दाक्षी (masculine dual of दाक्षि).

Vart:- The word <i>stri</i> in the <i>sutra</i> means <i>Vriddha</i> <i>stri</i>, that is the eldest daughter of a grandson, or a further descendant considered as the female head of the family. The words '<i>tal</i> <i>lakshanas</i> <i>chedeva</i> <i>viseshah</i>' of the previous <i>sutra</i> govern this <i>sutra</i> also, i.e. the distinction between the two words must be in their formative element and not in any thing else.
