The words भ्रातृ 'brother' and पुत्र 'son', when spoken of along with स्वसृ 'sister' and दुहितृ 'daughter' respectively are only retained and the latter are dropped.
With this <i>sutra</i> ceases the governing force of the remaining conditions contained in <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.65]]. Even where the radical elements of two words are different there may be an <i>ekasesha</i> under special circumstances. Thus भ्रातृ + स्वसृ = भ्रातरौ (brother and sister or brothers). Similarly पुत्र + दुहितृ = पुत्रौ, (son and daughter or sons).

N. B.- The practical application of this <i>sutra</i> is very neatly illustrated by the following example. There is a verse in <i>Yajyanvalkya</i> <i>smriti</i> पत्नी दुहितरश्श्चैव पितरौ भ्रातरस्तथा which declares that on the death of a sonless person his property passes to his wife, daughters, parents and <i>bhratarah</i>.

Here the word <i>bhratarah</i>, if it be taken as simply the plural of <i>bhratri</i>, it means "brothers" and excludes sisters. But if it be interpreted according to this <i>sutra</i>, it means "brothers and sisters"; and thus gives sisters a right to inherit property of their brothers.
