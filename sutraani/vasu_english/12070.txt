The word पितृ 'father' is optionally only retained when spoken of along with मातृ 'mother'.
Thus पिता + माता = पितरौ 'father and mother, or parents' or मातापितरौ. The verse quoted under <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.68]] illustrates this <i>sutra</i> also. There the word <i>pitarau</i>' has been explained by all commentators as "father and mother." The word "<i>ekavad</i>" of the last <i>sutra</i> does not govern this <i>sutra</i>; though the <i>anuvritti</i> of 'optionally' is to be read into this.
