The pronouns त्यद् etc. when spoken of along with any other noun, (pronoun other than त्यद् etc.) are always retained as एकशेष (to the exclusion of others).
The list of '<i>tyadadi</i>' pronouns has been given under <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.27]]. They are 12 words beginning with '<i>tyad</i>' and ending with '<i>kim</i>;' when these <i>tyadadi</i> pronouns are compounded with any other noun, (or a pronoun, which does not belong to their class), they prevail, the rest are dropped. The word '<i>sarva</i>' is used in the aphorism to indicate 'universality'; i. e. what ever may be the word in composition with them, the '<i>tyad</i> &c.' are retained to the exclusion of others. The word '<i>nitya</i>' is used to indicate that this is an obligatory rule, and not optional, as were the last rules.

Thus सः (he) + देवदत्तः (<i>Devadatta</i>) = तौ (they two).

Vart:- When त्यदादि words are compounded among themselves, the word which is read last in the order given in the <i>Ganapatha</i> remains, the rest are dropped. Thus यः + सः = यौ; यः + कः = कौ ॥ Thus यद् is read after तद् (see [[1.1.27]]). So यद् will be retained and not तद्. Similarly किम् is read after यद्, and therefore किम् is retained to the exclusion of यद्.
