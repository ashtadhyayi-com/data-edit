In उपदेश , the final consonant of roots etc. is इत्।
All the final consonants of roots, affixes, &c., are indicatory. As in the <i>pratyahara</i> <i>sutras</i> अ इ उ ण्; here ण् is इत् ॥ ऋ लृ क्; here क् is इत् ॥ ए ओड्; here ङ् is इत् ॥ ऐ औच्; here च् is इत् ॥ It is only in <i>upadesa</i>, that a final consonant is इत्. Not therefore, in अग्निचित् or सोमसुत्, which are complete words.
