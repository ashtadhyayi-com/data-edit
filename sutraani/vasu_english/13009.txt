Of this, (namely of that which has been called इत् ), there is elision.
This <i>sutra</i> declares the function of इत्; namely it is a mere indicatory letter, and must be rejected. It is useful only as a mnemonic and is not a part of the term.

The word <i>tasya</i> in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the substitution of <i>lopa</i> must be in the place of the whole term called इत्, and not only in the place of the final letter, which last is the general rule (see. [[1.1.52]]). Therefore, the whole of ञि, टु  and डु is rejected and not only their finals.
