When a rule involves the case of equal numbers of substitutes and of things for which these are to be substituted, their mutual correspondence or assignment of each to each, is according to the order of enumeration.
Thus <i>sutra</i> (III.I 134) (नन्दिग्रहिपचादिभ्यो ल्युणिन्यचः) declares- 'the affixes ल्यु, णिनि and अच् are applied to नन्दि, ग्रहि and पच् class of words.' It means the affix ल्यु is applied to the words of नन्दि class, the affix णिनि to words of ग्रहि class, and अच् to words of पच् class. The application must be respectively according to order, and not hap-hazard. Similarly in [[6.1.77]] इको यणचि (if a vowel follows) in the place of इ, उ, ऋ, लृ there is यण् i. e., य्, र्, ल्, व् ॥ So also see <i>Sutra</i>. [[4.3.94]] (तूदीशलातुरवर्मतीकूचवाराड् ढक् छण् ढञ् यकः) where the four affixes <i>dhak</i>, <i>chhan</i> <i>dhan</i>, and <i>yak</i> are applied respectively to the words <i>tudi</i>, <i>salatura</i>, <i>varmati</i> and <i>kuchavara</i>; i.e., the first affix in the order of enumeration to the first word, the second affix to the second word, &c. As तौदेयः, शालातुरीयः, वार्मतेयः and कौचवार्य्यः ॥

Why do we say 'of equal members'? This rule will not apply if the number of substitutes and of things for which these are to be substituted are unequal. As in <i>sutra</i> (1.4. 90), लक्षणेत्थभूताख्यानभागवीप्सासु प्रति पर्यनवः for here the words <i>lakshana</i>, &c., in the first part of the <i>sutra</i> are four in number, while the words <i>prati</i> &c. are only three. That <i>sutra</i> therefore must be read as thus. "The words प्रति, परि and अनु are <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i>, whenever they indicate either <i>lakshana</i> (a mark), <i>itthambhuta</i> <i>khyana</i> (a statement of mere circumstance); <i>bhaga</i> (division); or <i>vipsa</i> (desire)."
