In these aphorisms, when a word is marked with a स्वरित accent, by that an अधिकार or a governing rule is to be understood.
When in this collection of grammatical <i>sutras</i>, there is any <i>sutra</i> that has a circumflex accent, it denotes that it is either the beginning of a subject and the subsequent <i>sutras</i> are governed by it, or that it ends a subject and separates the previous <i>sutras</i> from the following.

As a rule, the <i>sutras</i> are not marked with accents; it is therefore from commentaries that one has to learn whether a <i>sutra</i> has a <i>svarita</i> or not. Thus the following <i>sutras</i> must evidently have <i>svarita</i> as they are governing <i>sutras</i>; प्रत्ययः (III.I.1.) धातोः [[3.1.91]], अङ्गस्य [[6.4.1]], भस्य [[6.4.129]].
