After verbs having the sense of 'motion', or 'injury', when expressing interchange of action, the आत्मनेपद affixes are used.
This aphorism prohibits <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes in certain cases where by force of the last <i>sutra</i> <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes would have been obtained. As व्यतिगच्छन्ति 'they go against each other,' व्यतिहिंसन्ति 'they injure each other.' व्यतिघ्नन्ति 'they fight together.'

The word 'not' of this <i>sutra</i> is understood in the subsequent <i>sutra</i>.

Vart:- This prohibition extends to the verbs हस् 'to laugh,' and the rest. As व्यतिहसन्ति, व्यतिजल्पन्ति, व्यतिपठन्ति ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be made of the verbs हरति 'to injure,' as संप्रहरन्ते राजानः ॥
