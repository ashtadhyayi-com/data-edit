After the verb क्री 'to purchase', when preceded by परि , वि or अव , the आत्मनेपद affix is employed, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
The verb डुक्रीञ् 'to buy or barter,' has an indicatory ञ् and therefore, by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it will be <i>Atmanepadi</i> when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present <i>sutra</i>, therefore, refers to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The root क्री 'to buy' as a general rule takes the terminations of both <i>padas</i>, but when it is preceded by <i>pari</i>, <i>vi</i>, or <i>ava</i>, it is restricted to <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations. As प्ररीक्रीणीते 'he buys'; विक्रीणीते 'he sells'; अवक्रीणीते 'he buys.'

The word <i>pari</i>, <i>vi</i>, and <i>ava</i> must be <i>upasargas</i>, therefore, in the following example, there is no <i>Atmanepada</i> termination, because the <i>vi</i> there is not a preposition but a noun, as, बहुविक्रीणाति वनम्.
