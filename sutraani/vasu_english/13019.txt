After the verb जि 'to conquer', preceded by वि or परा , the आत्मनेपद affix is employed.
As विजयते 'he conquers', पराजयते 'he conquers.' The words <i>vi</i> and <i>para</i> must be <i>upasargas</i> (prepositions), for the application of this rule. In the following examples, they are used as substaintives बहुविजयति वनम्, पराजयति सेना ॥
