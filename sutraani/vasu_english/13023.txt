After the verb स्था 'when meaning to indicate one's intentions to another', or 'to make an award as an arbitrator', the आत्मनेपद affix is employed.
The word <i>prakasana</i> means disclosing one's intentions. The word <i>stheyakhya</i> is a compound of <i>stheya</i> 'arbitrator; and <i>akhya</i> 'name.'

As तिष्ठते जायापत्ये 'the wife expresses her wish to the husband;' त्वयितिष्ठते 'he refers to thee for settlement;' संशय्य कर्णादिषु तिष्ठते यः, 'who, when he is in doubt, has recourse to <i>Karna</i> as his judge or umpire.'
