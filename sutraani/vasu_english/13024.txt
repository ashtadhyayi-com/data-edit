After the verb स्था 'to stand', preceded by उत् , when not meaning 'to get up or rise', as from a seat; the आत्मनेपद affix is used.
The word '<i>karma</i>' in this aphorism means 'action,' and does not mean the grammatical <i>karma</i> or 'object.'

As गेहे उत्तिष्ठते 'he strives for the house' so also कुटुम्बे उत्तिष्ठते ॥ But आसनादुत्तिष्ठति 'he rises up from the seat.'

Vart:- The force of the preposition <i>ut</i> must be to express ईहा, 'effort, exertion, wish or desire, to surprise or excell.' If this be not the force of <i>ut</i>, the terminations are those of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>. As अस्माद् ग्रामात् शतमुत्तिष्ठति 'a hundred is yielded by this village.' The word ईहा qualifies the word '<i>anurdhakarmani</i>,' and does not debar the latter.
