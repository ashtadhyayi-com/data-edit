After the verb स्था 'to stand', preceded by उप , when meaning 'to adore', the आत्मनेपद affix is used.
As ऐन्द्र्यागार्हपत्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches with prayers or worships the <i>Garhapatya</i> fire with <i>aindra</i> hymns.'

If it does not mean 'praising with hymns' the terminations which the verb takes, are those of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, as भर्तारमुपतिष्ठति यौवनेन 'she approaches the husband through youth.'

Vart:- The verb स्था after the preposition उप takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when meaning 'worshipping a deity,' 'to approach for intercourse or uniting or joining,' 'to form friendship with,' and 'to lead to as a way.' Thus:- 1st <i>Deva</i> <i>puja</i> आदित्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he worships the <i>Aditya</i>.' 2. <i>Sangati</i> <i>karana</i> पतिमुपतिष्ठते नारी 'the wife approaches the husband,' रथिकानुपतिष्ठते 'forms union with charioteers.' 3. <i>Mitri</i> <i>karana</i> सन्तमुपतिष्ठते साधुः 'the good man approaches the saints to make friends with.' What is the difference between <i>Sangati</i>-<i>karana</i> and <i>Mitri</i>-<i>karana</i> ? <i>Sangati</i>-<i>karana</i> means drawing near and approaching together in space, as गंगायमुनामुपतिष्ठते 'the Ganges joins the <i>Jumna</i>.' While the friendly relations may be established without coming in physical contact. 4. <i>Patha</i> :- अयं पन्थाः स्रुघ्नमुपतिष्ठते 'this road leads to <i>Srughna</i>.'

Vart:- It must be stated that the <i>Atmanepada</i> is optional when the sense is 'desire of getting.' As भिक्षुको ब्राह्मणकुलमुपतिष्ठते or उपतिष्ठति 'a beggar waits at the place of a <i>Brahmana</i> with the desire of getting something.'
