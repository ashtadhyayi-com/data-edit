After the verb स्था 'to stand', preceded by उप , when meaning 'to adore', the आत्मनेपद affix is used.
As भोजनकाले उपतिष्ठते 'he stands ready at the time of dinner,' यावदभुक्तमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever it is dinner time,' यावदोदनमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever there is food, that is he comes at the time of dinner.' The word <i>bhukta</i> is formed by adding the affix <i>kta</i> to the root, and has the force of condition' here.

The phrase 'when used in the Intransitive' governs the three succeeding <i>sutras</i> also.

If it is transitive; the verb <i>upastha</i> takes the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations. As राजानमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches the king.'
