After the verbs ह्वे 'to call', preceded by नि , सम् , उप and वि , the आत्मनेपद is used, even, when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
The verb ह्वेः 'to call' whether transitive or intransitive is <i>Atmanepadi</i> after the above prepositions. The condition of being Intransitive does not apply to this <i>sutra</i>, and from this <i>sutra</i> forward general rules of <i>Atmanepada</i> are treated of. As निह्वयते, संह्वयते, उपह्वयते ॥

The verb ह्वे is marked in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with a ञ् and therefore, by <i>sutra</i> 72 of this Chapter, it will take the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. But even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the verb <i>hve</i> takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when preceded by the above prefixes.

Vart:- The verbs अस् 'to throw' and ऊह 'to note' take optionally <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes when compounded with <i>upasargas</i>. As निरस्यति—०ते 'he casts out,' समूहति—०ते 'he collects.'
