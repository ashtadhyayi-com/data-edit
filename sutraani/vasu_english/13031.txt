After the verbs ह्वे 'to call', when meaning 'to challenge' and preceded by अङ् , the आत्मनेपद is used, even, when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
As मल्लो मल्लामाह्वयते 'an athlete challenges another athlete (in order to conquer him)'; छात्रश्छात्रमाह्वयते 'one student emulates with another student.'

This <i>sutra</i> is also for the purpose of showing that the root <i>hve</i> takes the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The word <i>spardha</i> means to emulate, to vie, to desire, to conquer another. When the verb <i>hve</i> has not the above signification, it takes the terminations of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As गामाह्वयति गोपालः 'the cowherd calls the cows.'
