After the verb कृ when meaning 'to divulge', 'to revile', 'to serve', 'to use violence', 'to cause change', 'to recite' and 'to do an act tending to effect a desired purpose', the आत्मनेपद is used, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
The verb कृञ् by <i>sutra</i> 72 would take the affixes of the <i>Atmanepada</i> when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This <i>sutra</i> has been begun to show that this verb takes the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations under certain circumstances even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.

The word <i>gandhana</i> comes from the root <i>gandh</i> 'to injure,' of <i>churadi</i> class and means to inform against another maliciously with the object of injuring such person. <i>Avakshepana</i> means 'to revile', 'to over-come,' <i>sevana</i> means 'to obey and serve,' <i>sahasikya</i> means 'an act of violence,' <i>pratiyatna</i> means, 'imparting a new quality or virtue,' <i>prakathana</i> means 'to narrate fully,' <i>upayoga</i> means 'the disposal of a thing for the object of attaining &c.'

Thus उत्कुरुते, उदाकुरुते a means he informs against; (2) श्येनो वर्तिकामुदाकुरुते 'the hawk overcomes or reviles a snail,' (3) गणिकानुपकुरुते 'he serves the prostitutes,' महामात्राननुकुरुते 'he serves the <i>mahamatra</i>,' (4) परदारान् प्रकुरुते 'he outrages another's wife,' (5) एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the fuel gives a new quality (boils) to the water (or he prepares the wood and water for a sacrifice).' The object of the verb <i>kri</i> takes the affix of the sixth case i. e. genitive, only when the verb means <i>pratiyatna</i>, see <i>Sutra</i> [[2.3.53]] (कृञः प्रतियत्ने) । Therefore <i>udakasya</i>, though an object, has genitive form. The verb takes the augment सुट् only when it is preceded by <i>upa</i> and signifies <i>pratiyatna</i>, see [[6.1.139]]. (उपात् प्रतियत्न वैकृत वाक्याध्याहारेषु) ॥ Therefore, there is the insertion of sibilant in <i>upaskurute</i>. (5) गाथाः प्रकुरुते 'he recites stories,' जनापवादान् प्रकुरुते 'he recites slander,' (6) शतं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a hundred pieces of money, for the sake of merit.' सहस्रं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a thousand.'

Why do we say in these senses? Witness कटं करोति 'he makes a mat.' In this case the <i>atmanepada</i> affix is not employed.

The verb <i>kri</i> is understood in the three succeeding <i>sutras</i>.
