After the verb नी 'to lead', when used in the sense of 'to guide so as to render the person guided worthy', 'to lift up', 'make one a spiritual guide', 'to determine the true sense', 'to employ on wages', 'to pay debt' and 'to give as in charity', even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the आत्मनेपद is used.
This <i>sutra</i> is begun in order to show that the verb नी may take the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i>, even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, in the following cases, viz, when it means to 'respect' &c.

<i>Sammanana</i> means to respect; as नयते चर्वी लोकायते 'the <i>Charvi</i> gives instruction in the <i>Lokayata</i> <i>sastra</i>.' The word <i>charvi</i> primarily means intelligence, and by secondary use it has been extended to the preceptor also; such a preceptor gives instruction, in <i>Lokayata</i> <i>Sastra</i>, that is to say, having established the truth of the doctrines of that philosophy by argumentation, imparts them to the pupils. Those doctrines being thus established by reason, become respected (<i>Sanmanita</i>) and honored.

<i>Utsanjana</i>, 'to throw up, or lift up,' as माणवकमुदानयते 'he lifts up <i>Manavaka</i>.'

<i>Acharya</i>-<i>karana</i> 'acting as a teacher,' that is to say, to bring a boy near oneself in such a way, that being so brought near (<i>upa</i>-<i>neta</i>), he may himself become an <i>acharya</i>, As माणवकमुपनयते 'he initiates <i>Manavaka</i> (i.e., making himself the preceptor he brings the boy near himself.')

<i>Jnana</i> means 'knowledge, a demonstrated verity.' As नयते चर्वीलोकायते 'the <i>Charvi</i> investigates the truth of the <i>Lokayata</i> doctrine.'

<i>Bhriti</i> means 'wages.' As कर्मकारानुपनयते 'he employs the servants on hire or wages.'

<i>Viganana</i> means the paying off as a tribute, debts &c. As मद्रा करं विनयन्ते, the <i>Madras</i> pay the tax due to the king, that is, they discharge the debt.'

<i>Vyaya</i> means 'allotment of money on works of merit &c.' As शतं विनयते 'he expends a hundred pieces on religious acts.' सहस्रं विनयते 'he devotes a thousand.

Why do we say, in these senses? Witness अजां नयति ग्रामम् 'he carries the goat to the village.' Here there is no <i>Atmanepada</i> affix, as the verb has not any one of the above significations.
