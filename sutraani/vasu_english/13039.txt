After the verb क्रम् , preceded by उप and पर , when used in the senses of 'continuity', 'energy' and 'development', the आत्मनेपद is used.
The words <i>vritti</i> &c., of the last <i>sutra</i> are understood here also. Why has this been made a separate <i>sutra</i> and not included in the last? The reason is to make a restrictive rule in the cases of <i>upasargas</i>; that is to say, only in the cases of the <i>upasargas</i> <i>upa</i> and <i>para</i>, there is <i>atmanepada</i> affix; but not so when any other <i>upasarga</i> precedes the verb <i>kram</i>, though the sense may be of continuity &c. Thus उपक्रमते 'he commences to advance,' पराक्रमते 'he marches to attack.'

Why do we say after the <i>upasargas</i> '<i>upa</i> and <i>para</i>'? Because, after any other preposition the affix will be of the <i>parasmaipada</i>; as संक्रामति 'he makes progress.' If the sense is not that of "continuity" &c., <i>parasmaipada</i> will be employed, as उपक्रामति, पराक्रामति.
