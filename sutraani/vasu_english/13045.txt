And when used intransitively after the verb ज्ञ , the आत्मनेपद is used, when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
As सर्पिषो जानीते मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice by means of clarified butter or honey.' (See [[2.3.51]]).

This <i>Atmanepadi</i> form of <i>jna</i> is employed when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. From <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.76]] it will be seen that when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the verb is <i>Atmanepadi</i>.

How in the above example the verb <i>jna</i> is intransitive? Because the word <i>sarpih</i> is not the object of knowledge, but it is an instrument of sacrifice, into which one engages from complete knowledge (<i>jnana</i>); and it (<i>sarpishah</i>) is in the genitive case by virtue of [[2.3.51]] (ज्ञोऽविदर्थस्य करणे) by which the instrumental <i>karaka</i> of the <i>jna</i> is put in the genitive case.

Why do we say of "Intransitive"? Because in the transitive it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>, as स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he knows (recognizes) the son by his voice.'
