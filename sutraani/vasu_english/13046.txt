After the verb ज्ञ , preceded by सम् and प्रति , the आत्मनेपद is used, when Not Used in the sense of 'remembering with regret'.
The word <i>jna</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>: and the aphorism applies to that <i>jna</i> which is used in the transitive. As शतं संजानीते 'he looks for a hundred,' So सहस्रं प्रतिजानीते 'he promises a thousand.'

Why do we say when 'not meaning remembering with regret?' Because it is not <i>Atmanepadi</i>, when it conveys that meaning. Thus मातुः संजानाति 'he remembers with regret his mother,' पितुः संजानाति ॥
