After the verb गॄ 'to swallow', when preceded by सम् , the आत्मनेपद affix is used in the sense of 'promising'.
As शनं संगिरते, 'he promises to pay a hundred rupees.' If it does not mean to promise or acknowledge, it takes <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations. As संगिरति ग्रासम्, 'he swallows the mouthful.'
