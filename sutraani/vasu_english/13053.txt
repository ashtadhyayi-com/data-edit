After the verb चर् 'to walk' preceded by उत् , when used intransitively, the आत्मनेपद is used.
As गेहमुच्चरते 'he strays away from home;' गुरुवचनमुच्चरते 'he transgresses the commands of his preceptor.'

Why do we say "when used in the transitive"? Observe बाष्पमुच्चरति 'the vapour is rising.' Here it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>.
