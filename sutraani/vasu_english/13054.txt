After the verb चर् 'to walk' preceded by सम् , and when connected with a noun in the Instrumental - 3rd Case, the आत्मनेपद is used.
As अश्वेन संचरते 'he rides on the horse-back.'

The rule does not apply when it is not in composition with a word in the instrumental case. As उभौ लोकौ संचरति इमं चामुं च देवल ! <i>O</i> <i>Devala</i>! thou wanderest through both regions, this and that.' Here though the sense of the Instrumental case is implied, yet as it is not expressly stated, we use the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations.
