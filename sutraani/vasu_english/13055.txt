And after the verb दा 'to give', preceded by सम् , and connected with a noun in the Instrumental - 3rd Case, the आत्मनेपद affix is used, provided this Instrumental Case has the sense of the Dative - 4th Case.
When is the 3rd case used with the force of the 4th case? That is answered by the following.

Vart:- The Instrumental has the force of the Dative when immoral conduct is implied. As दास्या or वृषल्या संप्रयच्छते 'he gives with the object of enticing to the female slave or prostitute.'

The verb <i>da</i> to give is generally <i>parasmaipadi</i>, it becomes <i>atmanepadi</i> under the above conditions.

Why do we say "when it has the force of the dative case"? Because when it has not the sense of the dative, <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations will be used, as पाणिना संप्रयच्छति, 'he gives with his hand.'

It might be asked how the <i>atmanepada</i> terminations are employed when the preposition <i>sam</i> is not directly applied to the verb, but another preposition <i>pra</i>, intervenes between <i>sam</i> and the verb. The reply is that the word <i>samah</i> in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.54]] is not in the ablative case (which would have required its being placed immediately before the verb), but it is in the genitive case, and is used as an attribute.
