After the verb यम् 'to give', preceded by उप , when used in the sense of 'espousing', the आत्मनेपद is used.
This is clear. As भार्यामुपयच्छते 'he espouses or knows his wife.' But not so when another's wife is meant; there it is <i>parasmaipadi</i>.

By rule [[1.3.78]], the verb <i>yam</i> would have been <i>parasmaipadi</i>, but the present <i>sutra</i> makes an exception, when the root takes the preposition <i>upa</i> and means "to marry, to espouse, or to accept." The meaning of <i>sva</i>-<i>karana</i> is confined to accepting in general. This is according to <i>Kasika</i>; according to <i>Mahabhashya</i>, <i>sva</i>-<i>karana</i> means to make one's own what was not previously his own.

Why do we say in the sense of "marrying"? When it has any other sense, <i>parasmaipada</i> affixes will be employed, as देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य भार्यामुपयच्छति, <i>Devadatta</i> has illicit intercourse with the wife of <i>Yajnadatta</i>.'
