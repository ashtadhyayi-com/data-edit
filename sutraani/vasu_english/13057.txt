After the Desideratives formed by the affix सन् , of the verbs ज्ञा 'to know', श्रु 'to hear', स्मृ 'to remember' and दृश् 'to see', the आत्मनेपद is used.
The above four roots are <i>atmanepadi</i> when in the Desiderative form, the suffix "<i>san</i>" being the <i>pratyaya</i> by which desideratives are formed.

The verb <i>jna</i> takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when used in the senses indicated by the three <i>sutras</i> [[1.3.44]], [[1.3.45]] and [[1.3.46]] already explained. The desiderative form of <i>jna</i> would ex necessitate take <i>atmanepada</i> affixes when used in the above senses: see Rule [[1.3.62]]. The present <i>sutra</i> however enlarges the scope of <i>atmanepada</i>, by declaring all desideratives of <i>jna</i> to be <i>atmanepada</i>, in whatever sense they may be used.

Similarly by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.29]] <i>ante</i> and the <i>vartika</i> under it, the roots <i>sru</i>, and <i>dris</i> take the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>; when preceded by <i>sam</i>, the desideratives of those would of course have taken <i>atmanepada</i> affixes by [[1.3.62]], but the present <i>sutra</i> makes it general.

The present <i>sutra</i> however enunciates a new rule in the case of the root <i>smri</i>.

As धर्म्मं जिज्ञासते 'he wishes to know (i. e. enquires after) religion,' गुरुं शुश्रूषते 'he serves the teacher,' नष्टं सुस्मूर्षते 'he wishes to remember the lost.' नृपं दिदृक्षते 'he wishes to see the king.'

Why do we say, when taking the affix <i>san</i>? Because the primitive verbs will take the <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations as जानाति 'he knows,' शृणोति 'he hears,' स्मरति 'he remembers' पश्यति 'he sees.'
