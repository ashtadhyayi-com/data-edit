The verb which is आत्मनेपदि in its primitive form before taking of the affix सन् , will also be आत्मनेपदि when it ends in the affix सन्। in other words; after a Desiderative verb, आत्मनेपद is used, if it would have been used after the primitive verb.
If the primary verb is <i>parasmaipadi</i>, its desiderative will be also <i>parasmaipadi</i>; if the primary verb is <i>Atmanepadi</i>, its desiderative will be <i>Atmanepadi</i>. This is the general rule. Some exceptions to it have already been mentioned in <i>sutras</i> [[1.3.57]], [[1.3.58]], and [[1.3.59]]. A root which was <i>atmanepadi</i>, before taking the Desiderative affix सन् <i>san</i>, will be <i>atmanepadi</i> even when it takes the affix सन् <i>san</i>. In other words, that by reason of which the <i>atmanepada</i> affixes were ordained in the primary verb, will cause the same terminations to be applied when the verb ends in सन् <i>san</i>. Thus it was said in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]], that roots having an <i>anudatta</i> accented vowel as indicatory or a ङ् in as their indicatory letter take the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus आस्ते 'he sits down' and शेते 'he sleeps.' The verb आस् (to sit down) and शीङ् (to lie down) will remain <i>atmanepadi</i>, even when they are used as Desideratives. Thus असिसिषते 'he wishes to lie down.' Similarly <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.17]] declared that the verb निविश् is <i>atmanepadi</i>, as निविशते. This will be <i>atmanepadi</i> also in the Desiderative form, as निविविक्षते 'he wishes to enter.' So also by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.40]], आक्रमते is <i>atmanepadi</i>, the Desiderative आचिक्रंसते will also be <i>atmanepadi</i>.

But though by [[1.3.60]] and [[1.3.61]], शीयते and म्रियते are <i>atmanepadi</i>, yet शिशत्सति 'he wishes to lie down,' मुमूर्षति 'he wishes to die,' are <i>parasmaipadi</i>. Because the <i>atmanepada</i> affixes were ordained after the roots शद and मृङ् only under exceptional conditions and not generically, and as those conditions do not exist in the desiderative, the latter does not take <i>atmanepada</i> terminations.

Of course that which in its primary state would not have taken the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i>, there being a prohibition to that effect, will not allow them in its Desiderative form. As अनुचिकीर्षति 'he wishes to imitate.' पराचिकीर्षति. Here the root कृञ् by rule [[1.3.79]] has been especially declared to be <i>parasmaipadi</i>, to the exclusion of <i>atmanepada</i> affixes which would otherwise have come by Rules [[1.3.32]] and [[1.3.72]], and therefore its Desiderative is also <i>parasmaipadi</i>. The force of ञ् causing <i>atmanepada</i> is counteracted by [[1.3.79]].

Now it might be asked :- True, this rule provides for those cases where a root is conjugated in two forms, one a Primitive and another a Desiderative conjugation. But what provision do you make for those partial verbs which take the affix सन् even in their primitive form; and in whose case we have no prior form to look upon as a guide in the application of <i>atmanepada</i> affixes. And there are at least 7 such quasi-roots which take सन् in this way, called also the self-descriptive सन्. Those quasi-roots are गुप्, तिज्, कित्, मात्, वध, दान्, and शान्. "What are we to do with these quasi-roots, which are always conjugated with the affix सन् and have no simpler conjugation ?" To this we reply; "In the case of these partial verbs which take the self-descriptive सन् the <i>pada</i> will be regulated by the indicatory letters which these quasi-roots have." For though the full roots are जुगुप्स, तितिक्ष, चिकित्स, मीमान्स, बीभत्स, शीशन्स and दीदान्स, yet by the maxim अवयवे कृतं लिङ्गं समुदायस्य विशेषकं भवति, "a sign made in a portion of a thing, qualifies the whole thing;" the sign made in the expression गुप् &c., will qualify the whole verb जुगुप्स &c." Thus we have जुगुप्सते he despises, चिकित्सते he cures; मीमांसते he investigates, &c.
