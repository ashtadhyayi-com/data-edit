Like the verb that takes the affix आम् , if the verb be conjugated with the आत्मनेपद terminations, so of the verb कृ when subjoined thereto as an auxiliary, the terminations are of the आत्मनेपद , even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
This <i>sutra</i> applies where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. There are in Sanskrit two forms of the perfect tense (लिट्): one formed in the ordinary way by the reduplication of the root and adding the terminations; the other called the periphrastic perfect, is formed by adding आम् to the root, and then affixing to it the perfect tense of the roots कृ (to do), भू (to be ) or अस् ( to be ). These latter verbs are called <i>anuprayoga</i> or auxiliary verbs, as it is with their help that the perfect tense is formed. The question then arises, what conjugation, <i>parasmai</i> or <i>atmanepada</i>, do these auxiliaries take in forming the periphrastic perfect? This <i>sutra</i> supplies the answer :--the auxiliary कृ follows the conjugation of principals, the other auxiliaries do not. Thus the root एध (to increase, prosper) is <i>atmanepadi</i>, therefore in forming the periphrastic perfect, the verb कृ will be also in the <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus एधांचक्रे (he prospered). Similarly इद् (to appear with great splendour) is <i>parasmaipadi</i> and the auxiliary कृ after it will be <i>parasmaipada</i>, as इन्दाञ्चकार (he appeared with great splendour).
.
But the other auxiliaries भू and अस् retain their own peculiar conjugation and are not influenced by the conjugation of their principal. Thus एधाम्बभूव, एधामास.

The word <i>am</i>-<i>pratyaya</i> of the <i>sutra</i> means 'that after which the affix <i>am</i> [[3.1.35]] and (III.I.36.) (कास्प्रत्ययादाममन्त्रे लिटि) comes.' Of the verb <i>krin</i>, when subjoined to another as an auxiliary, the termination is that of the <i>atmanepada</i> like the verb that takes the affix <i>am</i>. If this <i>sutra</i> enjoined a rule of injunction (<i>vidhi</i>), then there would be the termination of the <i>atmanepada</i> even in examples like उदब्जांचकार and उदम्भांचकार where the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This is no valid objection to the present <i>sutra</i>. It is to be interpreted in both ways, that is, both as a <i>vidhi</i> (a general injunction) and a <i>niyama</i> (a restrictive injunction). How is that to be done? Because the word <i>purvavat</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> is to be read in the present aphorism also. The second explanation in that case will be for the sake of establishing a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule.

It has already been said above that the auxiliary verbs कृ, भू and अस् are used in forming the periphrastic perfect. This is done by force of the aphorism [[3.1.40]], कृञ्चानुप्रयुज्यते लिटि, meaning, the verb <i>krin</i> is annexed in the perfect tense, to verbs, that take <i>am</i>. In this <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.40]] the word <i>krin</i> is a <i>pratyahara</i>, implying the verbs कृङ्, भू and अस्. It might be asked how is this <i>pratyahara</i> formed? The word <i>kri</i> is taken from the fourth word of <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.50]], अभूतद्भावे कृभ्वस्तियोगे &c., and the letter <i>n</i> is taken from <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.58]] कृञोद्वितीय &c. This is the way in which the commentators explain how not only the verb <i>krin</i> is used as an auxiliary in forming the periphrastic perfect, but also the verbs भू and अस्. These three verbs denoting absolute action unmodified by any especial condition have in all languages been fixed upon as the best auxiliaries.

It must, however, be noted that the word <i>krin</i> in this <i>sutra</i> is not used as a <i>pratyahara</i> and consequently does not include the verbs भू and अस्.
