After the verb युज् 'to join', the आत्मनेपद is used, when it is preceded by प्र and उप except with reference to sacrificial vessels even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
The verb युजिर् 'to join' is <i>svaritet</i>, and consequently by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it is always <i>atmanepadi</i>, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present <i>sutra</i> declares when this verb may take the terminations of <i>atmanepada</i>, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. After the verb युज् preceded by the prepositions  प्र and उप the terminations are of the <i>atmanepada</i>, when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels. As प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he joins or employs'; उपयुङ्क्ते 'he fits or uses.'

Why do we say "when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels?" Because there the terminations will be of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As द्वन्द्वं न्यञ्चि पात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति.

Vartika:- It shall be rather stated that the root takes the terminations of the <i>atmanepada</i> when preceded by any preposition beginning or ending with a vowel. This is an important modification of the above rule. Thus उद्युङ्क्ते and नियुङ्क्ते. In fact, all <i>upasargas</i>, with the exception of सम्, निर्, and दुर्, either begin or end with a vowel, and therefore the <i>Vartika</i> amounts to the inclusion of all prepositions with the above exception.

With सम्, निर् and दुर्, however, the root will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations; as संयुनक्ति.
