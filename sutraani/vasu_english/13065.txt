After the verb क्षणु 'to sharpen', preceded by सम् , the आत्मनेपद is used.
The verb क्ष्णु 'to sharpen, whet, or grind,' is generally <i>parasmaipadi</i>, but it is <i>atmanepadi</i>, when it is preceded by the prefix सम्; as संक्ष्णुते शस्त्रम् 'he whets the weapon', संक्ष्णुवाते 'they two whet', संक्ष्णुवते 'they all whet.'

It might be objected, why has a separate aphorism been made of the verb <i>kshnu</i>, when it could well have been included in the <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.29]] <i>ante</i>, which also speaks of the force of the prefix <i>sam</i>, when used with the verbs <i>gam</i>, <i>richchha</i>, &c. To this the answer is that, that <i>sutra</i> treats of intransitive verbs, the word <i>akarmaka</i> being understood therein, while the present <i>sutra</i>, as is evident from the example we have given above, treats of transitive verbs.
