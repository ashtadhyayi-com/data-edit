After the verb भुज् , the आत्मनेपद is used, except in the sense of protecting.
The root <i>bhuj</i> when it does not mean to protect, is <i>atmanepadi</i>. This root belongs to the <i>rudhadi</i> class and has several meanings, as, to feed, to cherish, to preserve, to eat, and to enjoy. As भुंक्ते 'he eats or enjoys'; also <i>bhunjate</i>, <i>bhunjate</i> &c. But पुत्रान् भुनक्ति पिता 'the father cherishes the sons', भुनक्त्येनमग्निराहितः.

The root <i>bhuj</i> belongs also to the <i>tudadi</i> class, but there it has the sense of being curved or crooked. The <i>bhuj</i> belonging to the <i>tudadi</i> class is not to be taken in this <i>sutra</i>, because that <i>bhuj</i> has never the sense of protecting. Therefore बिभुजति पाणिम् 'he bends the hand,' is in the <i>parasmaipada</i>.
