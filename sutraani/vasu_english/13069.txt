After the causatives of the verbs गृध 'to covet' and वञ्च 'to go' the आत्मनेपद is used in the sense of 'deceiving' even though the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.
The phrase 'of the causatives ending in णि' is to be supplied here from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. This <i>sutra</i> is also restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word प्रलम्भन of the <i>sutra</i> means deceiving. As मानवकं गर्धयते 'he deceives the boy,' मानवकं वञ्चयते 'he cheats the boy.'

Why do we say 'when it means deceiving,' For these verbs have not this meaning, their causatives take <i>parasmaipada</i>. As श्वानं गर्धयति 'he causes the dog to bark,' अहिं वञ्चयति 'he avoids the serpent.'
