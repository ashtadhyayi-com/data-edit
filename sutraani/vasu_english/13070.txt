After the causative of the verb लि 'to melt or stick', the आत्मनेपद is employed, when used in the sense of showing respect, subduing and deceiving, even though the fruit of action does not accrue to the agent.
The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied here from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. This <i>sutra</i> has its scope only when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. In the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, there are two roots ली, one is technically called लीङ् and means to stick, and belongs to <i>divadi</i> class. The other ली meaning to 'melt' belongs to <i>kryadi</i> class. As there is no specification in the <i>sutra</i> what ली is to be taken, both are therefore taken.

The force of the word च in the <i>sutra</i> is to include the word प्रलम्भन 'to delude' of the last <i>sutra</i> into the present. The word संमानन means to show respect. The word शालीनीकरण means to subdue. As जठाभिरालापयते 'he gets respect or causes respect to be shown to him through or on account of his matted hair.' श्येनो वर्तिकामुल्लापयते 'the hawk subdues the partridge', कस्त्वामुल्लापयते 'who deceives thee.'

The <i>sutra</i> विभाषा लीयतेः [[6.1.51]] declares that the ई of ली is optionally changed into आं before certain terminations. But there is no option allowed when the root ली has any of the above three senses : in these cases the substitution of आ is necessary and not optional. For the option allowed by <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.51]] is a व्यवस्थितविभाषा and not a general विभाषा applicable everywhere.

Why do we say 'when it has the meaning of 'to show respect, &c.'? Because otherwise there is <i>parasmaipada</i>. As बालकमुल्लापयति.
