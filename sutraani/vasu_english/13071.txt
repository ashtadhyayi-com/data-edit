After the causative of the verb कृ , the आत्मनेपद is used, when it has the word मिथ्या 'incorrect', as an उपपद or dependent word and is used in the sense of 'repeated wrong utterance', even when the fruit of action does not accrue no the agent.
The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.67]]. The aphorism is restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word <i>abhyasa</i> means doing again, or repetition; as पदं मिथ्या कारयति means 'he repeatedly pronounces the word incorrectly, that is with wrong accent, &c., not once but constantly'.

Why do we say 'when the word <i>mithya</i> is used as an <i>upapada</i>?' The causative of <i>kri</i> will take <i>parasmaipada</i> when it has any other <i>upapada</i>. Thus पदं सुष्टुम् कारयति 'he pronounces the word correctly.'

Why do we say 'of the verb कृञ्? Because the causative of any other verb used along with the word <i>mithya</i> will not have <i>atmanepada</i>; as पदं मिथ्या वाचयति 'he repeatedly utters the word wrongly.' Here वच् takes <i>parasmaipada</i>.

Why do we say 'repeatedly'? For if the incorrect utterance is not habitual, then <i>parasmaipada</i> will be used; as पदं मिथ्याकारयति 'he pronounces wrongly, not always but once.'
