After a verb ending in the affix णि (causal) when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the आत्मनेपद is used.
The phrase "when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent" is to be supplied from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. The verbs that take the affix णिच् <i>nich</i> are generally causatives. As कटं कारयते 'he causes the mat to be made for himself'; ओदनं पाचयते 'he causes the food to be cooked for himself.' When the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the <i>parasmaipada</i> is used. As कटं कारयति परस्य 'he causes another's mat to be made.'
