After the verb यम् 'to strive', preceded by सम् , उत् and आङ् , when it does not refer to a book, the आत्मनेपद is used, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.
The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is read into this aphorism by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. As ब्रीहीन् संयच्छते 'he gathers rice'; भारमुद्यच्छते 'he lifts up the load'; वस्त्रमायच्छते 'he draws out the cloth.' The root <i>yam</i> preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> by virtue of aphorism [[1.3.28]] <i>ante</i>; but in that aphorism the verb was intransitive, here it is transitive, and this explains the necessity of making two different <i>sutras</i> for one compound verb आयम्.

Why do we say 'when it does not refer to a book.' For otherwise the verb will take the terminations of the <i>parasmaipada</i>. As उद्यच्छति चिकित्सां वैद्यः 'the physician diligently studies medicine.'

When however the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the above compound verbs are <i>parasmaipadi</i>. As संयच्छति, उद्यच्छति, आयच्छति.
