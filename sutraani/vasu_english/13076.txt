After the verb ज्ञा , when not preceded by any उपसर्ग , the terminations are of the आत्मनेपद , when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.
The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also. Thus गां जानीते 'he recognises the cow as his own'; अश्वं जानीते 'he recognises the horse as his own.'

Why do we say when not preceded by any <i>upasarga</i> ? For when compounded with prepositions, it may take the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations; as स्वर्गं लोकं न प्रजानाति मूढः 'the fool does not know the heavenly regions.'

When, however, the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the simple root ज्ञा takes <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations. देवदत्तस्य गां जानाति 'he recognises <i>Devadatta</i>'s cow.'
