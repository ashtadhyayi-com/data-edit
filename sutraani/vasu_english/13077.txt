The आत्मनेपद is optionally used, when the fact of the fruit of the action accruing to the agent is indicted by an उपपदग i.e. by a word used along with the verb.
By the preceding five <i>sutras</i> [[1.3.72]] to [[1.3.76]], <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations were ordained to come after verbs which implied the accrual of the fruit of the action to the agent, that is to say, where the verb by itself denoted this. But when the same idea, instead of being inherent in the verb, is expressed by an <i>upapada</i>, that is by a word governed by the verb, the necessity of using the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes, to denote the same idea, is obviously removed, and in such a case it is optional whether we use the <i>Atmanepada</i> or the <i>Parasmaipada</i> terminations. As स्वं यज्ञं यजति or यजते 'he sacrifices for his own <i>yajna</i>'; स्वं कटं करोति or कुरुते 'he makes his own cot.'; स्वं पुत्रमपवदति or अपवदते; स्वंमोदनं पाचवते or पाचयति, &c. So on with all the above five <i>sutras</i>.
