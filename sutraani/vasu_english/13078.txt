After the rest i.e. all those verbs not falling under any one of the previous provisions, the terminations of the परस्मैपद are used, in marking the agent i.e. in the active voice.
The rules of <i>Atmanepada</i> have been declared in the preceding 66 <i>sutras</i>, [[1.3.12]] to [[1.3.77]]. The terminations of the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, which are the general verbal terminations, will come everywhere else, that is to say, where its operation is not debarred by any one of the preceding aphorisms. The present <i>sutra</i> declares this universal rule. The word <i>sesha</i> or the rest, means that which is the residue after the application of all the previous restrictive rules. Thus it was declared by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] <i>ante</i> that a root having an <i>Anudatta</i> vowel or a ङ as <i>it</i>, will take <i>Atmanepada</i> termisations. As आस्ते शेते. The converse of this will take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations, namely all verbs which do not have an <i>anudatta</i> accent or a ङ as <i>it</i>. Thus याति 'he goes,' वाति 'it blows.' It has been declared by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.17]] that the root विश when preceded by नि takes <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations, as निविशते. When not preceded by नि but any other preposition, it will take the <i>parasmaipada</i> termination. As आविशति, प्रविशति.

Why do we say "when marking the agent"? For when used in the passive voice the root will take the <i>Atmanepada</i> termination. As पच्यते 'it is cooked', गम्यते 'it is gone.'

Why is not <i>parasmaipada</i> used when the verb is employed reflexively ? As in the following example :- पच्यते ओदनः स्वयमेव 'the food cooks of itself.' Because in the present <i>sutra</i> the word कर्तरि of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.14]] <i>ante</i> is to be read in by <i>anuvritti</i>, so that, in fact there are two कर्तरि in this aphorism which thus means "when the agent of the verb is an agent pure and simple then <i>parasmaipada</i> is employed." While when a verb is used reflexively (कर्म्मकर्तरि) the agent of the verb is also, in one aspect, the object of the verb; and it is therefore, that in reflexive verbs the <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations are employed.
