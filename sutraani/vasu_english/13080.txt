After the verb क्षिप् 'to throw', coming after अभि , प्रति and अति , परस्मैपद is used, even though the fruit of the action goes to the agent
The root क्षिप् to throw, is <i>svariteta</i> therefore by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] <i>ante</i>, it would have taken <i>Atmanepada</i> termination, when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent; this aphorism ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead. As अभिक्षिपति 'he throws on,' प्रतिक्षिपति 'he turns away or rejects,' अतिक्षिपति 'he throws beyond.'

Why do we say 'when coming after <i>abhi</i>, <i>prati</i>, and <i>ati</i>'? Because when compounded with any other preposition, it will not take <i>parasmaipada</i>, but will be governed by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]]. As आक्षिपते 'he throws down.'

The second कर्तृ of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.14]] is also understood here, so that when the verb is used reflexively, the agent not being purely an agent, the present <i>sutra</i> will not apply. As अभिक्षिप्यते स्वयमेव 'it is thrown on of itself.'
