After the verb मृष् 'to bear', preceded by परि , परस्मैपद is used when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent.
The root मृष "to suffer" is <i>svaritet</i>, and by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.72]] it would have taken <i>Atmanepada</i> termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This ordains <i>parasmaipada</i> instead. As परमृष्यति 'he endures or he becomes angry.' When not preceded by this preposition, it takes <i>Atmanepada</i> termination. As आमृष्यते.

According to some authors, the root वह of the last aphorism is said to be understood in this, so that वह preceded by परि will also take <i>parasmaipada</i> terminations; as परिवहति
