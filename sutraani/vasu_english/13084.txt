And also after उप , the verb रम् takes the affixes of the परस्मैपद।
As देवदत्तमुपरमति 'he causes <i>Devadatta</i> to refrain.' The sense of the verb <i>uparamati</i> is causative here, as if it was उपरमयति. This is an example of a verb involving in it the force of the causative affix णिच्.

It might be asked why was not the preposition उप read along with the other preposition in the last aphorism, instead of making this a separate <i>sutra</i>. The answer is that the necessity of making a separate <i>sutra</i> with the preposition <i>upa</i> arose from the exigencies of <i>sutra</i> making. It is desired, that the next <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.85]] should apply only to the root <i>upa</i>-<i>ram</i>, and not to other compounds of <i>ram</i>; and this could only be done by making these two distinct _sutras.
