And after the causatives of verbs which have no sense of the 'eating or swallowing' and 'shaking or moving' परस्मैपद is used, even when the fruit of the action goes to the agent.
The phrase 'when used in the causative (णेः) of the last <i>sutra</i> is to be read into this also. The <i>parasmaipada</i> is ordained as an exception to <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]] by which <i>atmanepada</i> was ordained when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. The word निगरणं means 'eating,' and चलनं means 'moving,' 'shaking.' As निगारयति he causes to swallow; आशयति he causes to eat; भोजयति he feasts; चलयति he moves; चोपयति, कम्पयति he shakens. This aphorism applies to transitive verbs, and to verbs whose agents in non-causative state are inanimate objects, i. e. not possessed with reason.

Vart:- The prohibition of the root अद to eat, must be mentioned. The causative of अद to eat, takes <i>atmanepada</i>. Thus अत्ति देवदत्तः <i>Devadatta</i> eats; आदयते देवदत्तेन he is made to eat by <i>Devadatta</i>.
