But the affixes of the परस्मैपद are not used after the causals of the verbs पा 'to drink', दम् 'to tame', आयम् 'to extend', आयस् 'to exert oneself', परिमुह 'to be bewildered', रुच् 'to shine' नृत् 'to dance', वद् 'to speak' and वस् 'to dwell'.
The last two aphorisms had ordained <i>parasmaipada</i> instead of <i>Atmanepada</i>, even when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent, thus debarring the latter's action which would otherwise have taken place by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]]. This <i>sutra</i> prohibits the last two <i>sutras</i>, and re-instates <i>Atmanepada</i> of <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.74]]. Thus root पा to drink, has the sense of <i>nigarana</i> or swallowing, the roots दम &c., have sentient beings as their agent; the root नृत् to dance has the sense of चलन or moving, but still these verbs have <i>atmanepada</i> affixes, and do not take <i>parasmaipada</i> in the causative. As पाययते he causes to drink, दमयते he causes to be tame, आयामयते he lengthens, आयासयते he troubles, परिमोहयते he entices, रोचयते he makes agreeable, नर्त्तयते he causes to dance, वादयते he makes to speak, वासयते he causes to dwell.

Vart:- The root धेट is should be enumerated along with पा &c. Thus धापयेते शिशुमेक समीची. The doe suckles a young infant.
