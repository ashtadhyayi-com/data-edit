These verbs are <i>anudatta</i> and so by <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.12]] they would have been invariably <i>atmanepadi</i>, this aphorism makes them optionally so in the aorist. Thus अद्युतत् or अद्योतिष्ठ he shone. In other tenses than the aorist (लुङ्) these verbs are invariably <i>Atmanepadi</i>. As द्योतते he shines.
