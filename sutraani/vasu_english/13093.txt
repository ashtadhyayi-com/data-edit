After the verb क्लिप् 'to be fit', परस्मैपद is optionally used, when लुट् (1st Future) is affixed, as well as when स्य and सन् are affixed.
The verb क्लप् is one of the five verbs of the sub-class वृतादि of the last aphorism. Therefore it will take both <i>parasmaipada</i> and <i>Atmanepada</i>, when the affixes स्य or सन follow. The present <i>sutra</i> makes the additional declaration in the case of Ist Future or लुट. Thus in <i>Lut</i> we have-- कल्प्तसि or कल्प्तासे thou wilt be; in Ist Future we have :- कल्पिष्यते or कल्प्स्यति he will be; in the Desiderative we have :- चिक्लृप्सति or चिकल्पिषते; in the conditional we have :- अकल्प्स्यत् or अकाल्पष्यत.
