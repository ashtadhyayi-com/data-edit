From this सूत्र up the the aphorism कडाराः कर्मधारये [[2.2.38]] only one name of each thing named is to be understood.
What is that name then? That which comes last, where the claims are otherwise equal [[1.4.2]] and that which were its claim disallowed, would have no other opportunity of conducing to any result, would be the recognised name. As a short vowel is called 'light' by [[1.4.10]] and it is also called 'heavy' when it precedes a conjunct consonant [[1.4.11]]. Thus a short vowel has two names 'light' and 'heavy.' But it will not be called 'light' when it precedes a conjunct consonant, but will have only one name, i.e. 'heavy.' Thus in भिद to divide छिद to split, the इ is 'light' while the same letter is 'heavy' in शिक्षा teaching भिक्षा begging.

Thus in the root तक्ष् the अ is 'heavy' and therefore in forming its aorist we have the form अततक्षत्. Similarly अररक्षत्. The rule [[7.4.93]] not applying here as that rule is applicable to <i>laghu</i> vowels only.
