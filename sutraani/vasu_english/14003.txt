Word-forms ending in long ई and ऊ being names of females called नदी।
The word यू is compound of ई + ऊ The word <i>stryakhya</i> means that which by itself denotes the name of a female. These words must be always feminine, having no masculine of the same form, as the word <i>gramani</i> has. As the words <i>Kumari</i> a virgin, यवागू, <i>yavaguh</i> rice gruel. The declension of nouns of <i>nadi</i> class is somewhat peculiar which will be treated of later. As see Rule [[7.3.112]] आट् is the augment of the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ when they come after a word ending with a <i>Nadi</i>.

Why do we say ending in ई and ऊ ? Because feminine nouns not ending in these vowels will not be declined like <i>Nadi</i> words. Thus while the dative of कुमारी will be कुमार्य्यै, the dative of दुहितृ will be दुहित्रे.

Why do we say 'which are feminine'? Because if they are names of males, they will not be called <i>Nadi</i>. As ग्रामणीः leader of a village; सेनानी leader of an army; खलपू a sweeper; their dative being ग्रामण्ये, सेनान्ये, खलप्ये.

Why have we used the word <i>akhya</i> 'name' in the text? Because feminine gender must be denoted by the word itself and not by any other epithet used along with the word. Thus if the head-borough or the sweeper should be of the female sex, the Dative Singular would still be ग्रामण्ये स्त्रियै and खलप्वे स्त्रियै.
