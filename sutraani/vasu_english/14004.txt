Feminine words ending in ई and ऊ which admit the substitute इयङ् and उवङ् [[6.1.77]] are not called नदी ; except the word स्त्री (which is called नदी not withstanding its substituting इयङ्).
The definition of <i>Nadi</i> given in the last <i>sutra</i> was rather too wide, this limits the scope. Thus श्री, happiness, भ्रू brow, admit the substitutes <i>iyan</i> and <i>uvan</i> respectively, and are not <i>nadi</i>. Their vocative singular is हे श्रीः, हे भ्रूः &c., while the vocative singular of <i>stri</i> is हे स्त्रि.
