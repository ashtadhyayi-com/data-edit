When a case-affix having an indicatory ङ् (ङित्) follows, then feminine words ending in short इ and उ are optionally termed नदी , as well as feminine nouns in long ई and ऊ which admit इयङ् and उवङ् ; but not so the word स्त्री which is always नदी।
Feminine words in long <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> have been defined as <i>nadi</i>, words in short vowels can never be termed <i>nadi</i>, while even some words in long vowels have also been excluded from the scope of the definition if they take <i>iyan</i> and <i>uvan</i> The present <i>sutra</i> declares an option in the case of all the above words, when a case-affix having an indicatory ङ follows.

The case-affixes having an indicatory <i>n</i> are the Dative, Ablative. Genitive and Locative singulars. Thus we have:--

Dative मतये or मत्यै, धेनवे or धेन्वै, श्रिये or श्रियै; Ablative and Genitive मतेः or मत्याः, धेनो or धेन्वाः, श्रियः or श्रियाः;  Locative मतौ or मत्याम्, धेनौ or धेन्वां, श्रियि or श्रियां. So also भ्रुवै or भ्रुवे & c. But <i>stri</i> is always स्त्र्यै &c.
