The rest of the words that end in short इ and उ are घि with the exception of the word सखि।
This defines the word <i>ghi</i>. The peculiarity of the declension of <i>ghi</i> words will be treated later on. The word <i>hrasva</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The word <i>sesha</i> or 'the rest' implies 'the words ending in short इ or उ which are not the names of females, or if they are feminine names, they are not <i>nadi</i> words.'

As अग्नि fire. Before case affixes having an indicatory <i>n</i>, the <i>ghi</i> nouns <i>gunate</i> there vowel [[7.3.111]]. As अग्नि + ङे = अग्ने + ए = अग्नये to the fire. So also  वायु + ङे = वायवे to the wind. But the declension of <i>sakhi</i> in these cases is :- सख्या सख्ये सख्यु and सख्यौ.
