When a conjunct consonant follows a short vowel is termed गुरु 'heavy'.
A <i>hrasva</i> vowel however is not to be called 'light' when it is followed by a conjunct consonant. As the <i>i</i> of शिक्षा 'learning' is a heavy vowel. Thus शिक्षा is derived from शिक्ष + अ [[3.3.103]], (let the affix अ come after that verb which has a heavy vowel and ends in a consonant when the word to be formed is feminine). So also कुण्डा and भिक्षा.
