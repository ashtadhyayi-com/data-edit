The word-form ending in न् , is called पद when क्य follows (i.e. the affixes क्यच् , क्यङ् and क्यष्।
These are affixes by which denominative verbs are formed from nouns. See [[3.1.8]], [[3.1.11]], and [[3.1.13]]. A word ending in न is called <i>pada</i>, when these affixes follow. Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राजीय 3rd Per. 8. राजीयति he behaves like a king. So also राजन् + क्यङ् = राजायते [[7.4.5]] चर्मन् + क्यष् = चर्मायते or चर्मायति. The result of its being called <i>pada</i> is that the न् of राजन्, चर्मन् &c., is elided by <i>Sutra</i> [[8.2.7]]. (there is elision of न् final in a <i>pada</i> which is entitled to the designation of <i>pratipadika</i>). Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राज + य = राजीय [[7.4.33]].

These three affixes क्यच् &c., come after case-inflected words (i.e., words ending in <i>sup</i>), and though, before these affixes, the case terminations are elided, still by <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.62]] such words would have retained the name of <i>pada</i> which they got by Rule 14 of this Chapter. The present <i>sutra</i> however makes a restriction (<i>niyama</i>). It declares that only words ending in न् retain the name of <i>pada</i>; while all other case-inflected words before these affixes do not retain that designation. Thus the words वाच् speech, स्रुच् a ladle are not treated as <i>pada</i> and we have वाच्यते and स्रुच्यते. Had they been <i>pada</i>, the च् would have been changed into क् by [[8.2.30]].
