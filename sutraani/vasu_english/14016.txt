When an affix having an indicatory स् follows then that which precedes it is called पद।
The sutra 18 of this chapter teaches that before certain affixes, the preceding word is called <i>bha</i>. This <i>sutra</i> declares an exception to that by anticipation. Thus Rule [[4.2.115]] declares: -- "Affixes ठक् and छस् come after the <i>vriddha</i> [[1.1.74]] word भवत्." Here the affix छस् has an indicatory स्, therefore the word भवत्, standing before it, will be called <i>pada</i>. Thus भवत् + छस् = भवदीयः [[7.1.2]], belonging to you. The result of being <i>pada</i> is that ते is changed into द [[7.2.3]]. Similarly स् is इत् in युस् (After the word <i>urna</i> there is <i>yus</i> [[5.2.123]]. Thus ऊर्णायुः; so also घस् [[5.1.106]], has स् as indicatory. Thus ॠत्वियः There is no <i>guna</i> because of its being <i>pada</i>
