The word-form ending in त् or in स् is called भ when an affix with the force of मतुप् 'whose is it' or 'in whom it is' [[5.2.94]], follows.
The word <i>Bha</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus is the word उदश्वित्वत् having butter milk Nom. Sing. उदश्वित्वान् पोषः the herdsman having butter milk, विद्युत्वान् बलाहकः the cloud full of thunder. So also यशस्वी famous; पयस्वी full of milk. Thus उदश्वित् + वतुप् = उदश्वित्वत्, यशस् + विनि [[5.2.121]] = यशस्विन्. By making these <i>Bha</i>, the operation of <i>pada</i> rule is debarred in their case. That is to say the त of <i>udasvit</i> &c., and the स् of <i>yasas</i> &c., are not changed into द and र respectively, which had they been <i>pada</i> words would have been the case by the action of <i>Sutra</i> [[8.2.39]], and [[8.2.66]]. viz., उदश्विद्वत् and यशोविन् which are incorrect.
