A noun whose relation to an action is that of a fixed point from which departure takes place is called अपादान or Ablation.
This defines the Ablation or <i>Apadana</i> <i>karaka</i>. Thus ग्रामादागच्छति he comes from the village. पर्वतादवरोहति he descends from the mountain. स्वार्थाद्धीनः lost his object. रथात् पतितः fallen from the chariot. The <i>Apadana</i> takes the 5th case-affix [[2.3.28]] and the above examples show this. When therefore this relation is to be expressed, 'the fixed point (like <i>grama</i>, <i>purvata</i> &c., in the above) which is the limit denoted by a word dependent on a verb, is called ablation.'

Vart:- The objects of verbs denoting 'aversion,' 'cessation' and 'negligence' are also called ablation. Thus:- अधर्माञ्जुगुप्सते he dislikes injustice; अधर्माद्विरमति he ceases from injustice. धर्मात्प्रमाद्यति he neglects justice.
