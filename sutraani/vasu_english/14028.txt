When concealment is indicated, the person whose sight one wishes to avoid, is called अपादान कारक।
Thus उपाध्यायादन्तर्धत्ते or निलीयते he conceals or hides from the teacher; so that the teacher may not find him out or see him.

Why do we say 'when concealment is indicated'? Observe चौरात् न दिदृक्षते he does not wish to see the thieves. Here the term <i>chauran</i> is in the accusative case.

Why has the word <i>ichchhati</i> been used in the text? The <i>apadana</i> <i>karaka</i> is to be used there only, where one desires that he should not be seen, yet he shows himself.
