The source of the agent of the verb भू 'to become' is called अपादान।
The phrase 'of the agent (<i>kartuh</i>)' is understood here. The word प्रभव means the source or that from which anything arises. As हिमवतो गंगा प्रभवति the Ganges has its source in the <i>Himalayas</i>. काश्मीरेभ्यो वितस्ता प्रभवति. The Hydaspes has its source in <i>Cashmere</i>.
