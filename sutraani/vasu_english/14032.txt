The person whom one wishes to connect with the object of giving, is called सम्प्रदान or recipient.
Though the word कर्मणा in the <i>sutra</i> is indefinitely used, meaning 'with the object' yet it is not every object of any verb. The object must be of the verb 'to give.'

As उपाध्यायाय गां ददाति he gives the cow to the teacher. माणवकाय भिक्षान् ददाति he gives alms to the boy. Here the words 'cow' and 'alms' are the object of the verb 'give'; the persons connected with this object are the teacher and the boy respectively. These latter are in the Dative case and take the 4th case-affix.

Vart:- The person whom one wishes to connect with the action should also be called recipient. As श्राद्धाय निगर्हते he censures for the sake of <i>Sraddha</i>. युद्धाय सनह्यते he prepares for battle. पत्ये शेते she sleeps for her husband.

Vart:- 2. After some verbs (especially to sacrifice), the object (<i>karma</i>) gets the name of Instrument (<i>karana</i>) and the recipient (<i>Sampradana</i>) is called object (<i>karma</i>).

Thus पशुना रुद्रं यजते or पशुं रुद्राय ददाति he sacrifices with an animal to <i>Rudra</i>, which is equivalent to, 'he gives an animal to <i>Rudra</i>.'
