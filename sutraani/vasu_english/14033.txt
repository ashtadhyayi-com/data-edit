In case of verbs having the signification of the root रुच् 'to like', the person or thing that is pleased or satisfied, is called सम्प्रदान or recipient.
The verbs having similar meaning (<i>artha</i>) as the word <i>ruchi</i> or 'liking' are रुच्यर्थ. A desire or longing caused by something else, is called <i>ruchi</i>. As देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः the sweet meat pleases <i>Devadatta</i>. यज्ञदत्ताय स्वदते ऽपूपः <i>Yajnadatta</i> likes <i>Apupa</i>. Here <i>modaka</i> is the agent that draws out the longing which is latent in <i>Devadatta</i>.

Why do we say 'the person pleased'? Observe देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः पथि. <i>Devadatta</i> likes <i>modak</i> in the way. The word <i>pathi</i> being in the 7th case.
