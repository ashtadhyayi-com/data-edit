In case of verbs श्लाघ् 'to praise', ह्नु 'to take away', स्था 'to stand', शप् 'to curse', the person whom it is intended to inform of or persuade by, these actions, is called सम्प्रदान।
The word ज्ञीप्स्यमान means whom it is desired to make known or inform. As देवदत्ताय श्लाघते he praises <i>Devadatta</i>, i.e., while praising <i>Devadatta</i>, he wishes that he should know this praise. So also with other verbs. As देवदत्ताय ह्नुते he hides from (wishing that <i>Devadatta</i> should know of it) <i>Devadatta</i>, देवदत्ताय तिष्ठते she offers herself to <i>Devadatta</i> (for sexual embrace, wishing that he should know of it). देवदत्ताय शपते he reviles <i>Devadatta</i>.

Why do we say 'the person whom it is intended to inform'? Observe देवदत्ताय श्लाघति पथि. Here <i>pathi</i> is in the Locative case.
