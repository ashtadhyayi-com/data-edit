In the case of the verbs having the sense of क्रद्ध् 'to be angry', द्रुह् 'to injure', ईर्ष्या 'to envy', असूया 'to detract', the person against whom the feeling of anger etc. is directed is called सम्प्रदान।
<i>Krudh</i> means non-tolerance, <i>droha</i> means doing wrong or hurt, <i>irshya</i> jealousy; and <i>asuya</i> means to find out the faults of another. The word <i>kopa</i> includes all the above four sorts of actions. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति-द्रुह्यति-ईर्ष्यति or असूयति he is angry upon, (i. e. with) or bears malice to, or is jealous of, or finds out the faults of <i>Devadatta</i>. Here <i>Devadatta</i> is in the Dative case.

Why do we say 'against whom the feeling of anger is directed.' Be if there be no feeling of anger, then these verbs will not govern the dative case, but the accusative. Thus भार्यामीर्ष्यति he is jealous of his wife, i.e., does not wish her to be seen by others. Here the word <i>bharya</i> is in the accusative case.
