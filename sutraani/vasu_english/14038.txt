But in the case of the verbs क्रुद्ध् and द्रुह् , when preceded by prepositions, the person against whom the feeling of anger etc. is directed is called कर्म कारक or object.
This aphorism is a proviso to the last, and enjoins accusative case, where by the last, there would have been dative. The word <i>upasrishta</i> means having <i>upasarga</i> or preposition. As देवदत्तमभिक्रुध्यति अभिद्रुह्यति. When used simply, those verbs of course govern the Dative case by the last aphorism. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति.
