In the case of the verbs राध् 'to propitiate' and ईक्ष् 'to look to', the person about whose good or bad fortune questions are asked is called सम्प्रदान।
The word <i>viprasna</i> means literally asking various questions; and denotes questioning about the good or bad luck of another. Thus देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते गर्गः <i>Garga</i> is favorable to or looks to <i>Devadatta</i>, the sense is that being casually asked by <i>Devadatta</i>, he reflects upon the good or bad fortune of <i>Devadatta</i>.

Another explanation of this <i>sutra</i> is, the agent that puts various questions is put in the dative case, As शिष्याय राध्नोति or ईक्षते वा गुरुः meaning, the pupil asks the teacher various questions to resolve his doubts, and the teacher answers those questions to the pupil.
