In the case of the verb श्रु preceded by the prepositions प्रति and अङ् and meaning 'to promise', the person to whom promise is made (literally: the person who as the agent of the former verb) is called सम्प्रदान।
The compound verb प्रतिश्रू and आश्रू means to promise. A promise is made on the motion or at the instance of another. The person so proposing who was the agent of the former action becomes the recipient of the promise in the latter case. As देवदत्ताय गां प्रतिशृणोति--आशृणोति he promises a cow to <i>Devadatta</i>.
