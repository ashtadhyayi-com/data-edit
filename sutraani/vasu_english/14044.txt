In the case of hiring on wages, that which is especially auxiliary in the accomplishment of the action of the verb परिक्री 'employing on stipulated wages', is optionally called सम्प्रदान or recipient.
This ordains dative case, where there would otherwise have been Instrumental case. The word परिक्रयणे means to engage for a limited period on payment of wages, and not absolute purchase for all time. As शताय परिक्रीतो ऽनुब्रूहि शतेन परिक्रीतो ऽनुब्रूहि.
