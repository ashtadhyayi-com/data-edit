That which is the site of the verb अभिनिविश् 'to enter', is also called कर्म कारक।
As ग्राममभिनिविशते he resorts to the village. This is an optional rule, as the word "option" of <i>sutra</i> [[1.4.44]] should be read into it. Thus we have the following forms also पापेऽभिनिवेशः resorting to sin. कल्याणेऽभिनिवेशः resorting to good. The rule here is that of <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasa</i>.
