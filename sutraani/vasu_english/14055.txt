That which is the mover thereof, i.e. of the independent source of action, is called हेतु or cause, as well as कर्ता or agent.
Thus कारयति he causes to be made, हारयति he causes to be taken. When <i>hetu</i> is employed as agent the verb is put in the causative form [[3.1.26]].

The force of the word च is to give both names to the mover of an agent, viz., <i>Hetu</i> and <i>karta</i>: otherwise by <i>sutra</i> 1 of this Chapter only one name would have been given.
