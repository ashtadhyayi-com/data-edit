The words प्र etc. are called निपात when not signifying substances.
The following is the list of प्रादयः or 'prepositions:' प्र, परा, अव, सम्, अनु, अव, निस्, दुस्, वि, आङ्, नि, अधि, अपि, अति, सु, उत्, अभि, प्रति, परि, उप ॥

The making of this a distinct aphorism, when it could well have been included in the last, is for the sake of giving the <i>Pra</i> &c., words two names, namely, those of <i>Nipatas</i>, as well as <i>upasargas</i> under certain circumstances, i.e., when they are in composition with verbs. Not so however the <i>cha</i> &c., words. They never get the designation of <i>upasargas</i>.

When these words signifying substances they are not <i>Nipatas</i>. As परा जयति सेना the excellent army conquers. Here the word परा is not a <i>Nipata</i>.
