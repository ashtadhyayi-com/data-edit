A word imitative of sounds is also called गति when it is not followed by the word इति।
The phrase अनितिपरम् is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound; अन्-इति-परम् = 'that which has not the word इति after it.'

As खाट्कृत्य having made the sound <i>khat</i>. खाट्कृतम् [[6.2.49]], यत्खाट्-करोति [[8.2.71]].

Why do we say 'when it has not the word इति after it?' Observe खाडितिकृत्वा निरष्ठीवत्.
