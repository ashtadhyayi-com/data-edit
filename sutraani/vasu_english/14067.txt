The word पुरः 'in front of', when indeclinable and in composition with a verb, is called गति।
The pronoun पूर्व 'front' with the affix असि forms पुरस्, and by [[1.1.38]] it becomes an <i>Avyaya</i>. (See [[5.3.39]] <i>pur</i> being substituted for <i>purva</i>). The object by making it <i>gati</i> is threefold (1) compounding by [[2.2.18]] (2) accent by [[6.2.49]] (3) to change the : <i>h</i> into स् by [[8.3.40]]. As पुरस्कृत्य, पुरस्कृतम् and यत् पुरस्करोति, when not an indeclinable we have पूः, पुरौ, पुरः कृत्वा काण्डंगतः.
