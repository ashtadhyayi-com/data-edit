And the indeclinable word अस्तम् 'at home' is called गति , when in composition with a verb.
The word अस्तम् is an indeclinable as it ends in म् (1.1. 39); and means 'not visible.' As अस्तंगत्य सविता पुनरुदेति the sun having set, rises again अस्तंगतानि धनानि riches that have vanished. यदस्तं गच्छति, when not an indeclinable it is not <i>gati</i> as अस्तं काण्डम् the arrow has been thrown.
