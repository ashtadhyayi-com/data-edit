The indeclinable word प्रध्वम् followed by the verb कृ , is always called गति when in used in the sense of 'binding'.
The word प्राध्वम् ends in म् and means 'favourably suitably.' When however it means 'bound' it is a <i>gati</i>: as, प्राध्वंकृत्य having bound. But when not meaning to bind, we have :- प्राध्वं कृत्वा शकटं गतः having made the carriage agreeable, he is gone.
