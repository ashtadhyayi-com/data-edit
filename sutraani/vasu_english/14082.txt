In the छन्दस् (Veda) these गति and उपसर्ग are also seen separated from the verb by intervening words.
As:-- इन्द्र वायू इमे सुता उप प्रयोभिरागतम् ॥ इन्दवो वा मुशन्तिहि (<i>Rig</i>. I.2.4). "<i>Indra</i> and <i>vayu</i>, here are <i>soma</i> libations for you. Approach, ye with pleasures for us. For the libations are desiring you." Here उप is separated from the word आगत by the intervening word प्रयोभिः.
