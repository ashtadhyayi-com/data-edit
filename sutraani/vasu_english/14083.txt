From this point as far as aphorism [[1.4.97]] treated of, are to be understood as having the name of कर्म-प्रवचनीय।
These particles govern a substantive and qualify a verb and differ from other particles termed <i>upasarga</i> and <i>gati</i>. As सुस्तुतं भवता well praised by you. सु सिक्तं भवता you have sprinkled. Here सु is a <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> and qualifies the sense of the verb, i. e. it is an adverb. It is not an <i>upasarga</i>, for had it been so, it would have changed the स into ष [[8.3.65]]. The term <i>karma</i> <i>pravachaniya</i> is a big term compared with other technical terms such as, टि, घि, घु &c., which generally do not exceed more than two syllables. The word <i>karmapravachaniya</i> is not however merely a technical term; it contains within itself a definition of itself. It means that which qualities or speaks about (प्रोक्तवन्त) an action (कर्म) is so called.
