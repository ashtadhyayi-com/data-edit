The words अप and परि are कर्म-प्रवचनीय when meaning 'exclusion'.
The force of अप and परि is in this case that of 'with the exception of.' As अपत्रिगर्त्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः it rained outside of or with the exception of <i>Trigarta</i>. So also परि त्रिगर्तेभ्यो वृष्टोदेवः. In this sense they govern the noun excluded in the ablative case [[2.3.10]]. When not having these senses, they are not <i>karma</i>-<i>pravachaniya</i>. As ओदनं परिषिञ्चति. He waters the rice. Here it is an <i>upasarga</i>, and hence changes the स into ष.
