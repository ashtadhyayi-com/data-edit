The word आङ् 'as far as', is कर्म-प्रवचनीय when it expresses limit (e.g. when it means 'as far as inclusive of' or 'as far as exclusive of').
The word वचन in the text shows that both sorts of limits are here meant. As आपाटलिपुत्राद् वृष्टो देवः it rained as far as (but excluding) <i>Pataliputra</i> आपाटलिपुत्रं वृष्टो देवः it rained as far as (including) <i>Pataliputra</i> आकुमारं यशः पाणिनेः आसांकाश्यात्, आमथुरायाः when it means 'little' or is a verbal prefix it does not get this name.
