The word प्रति is कर्म -प्रवचनीय when used in the sense of representative ('representative of') or exchange ('in exchange for').
That which is like to the principal is called प्रतिनिधि. Giving in return for what is obtained, is प्रतिदान. As अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति <i> Abhi</i>-<i>manyu</i> is the representative of <i>Arjuna</i>. माषानस्मै तिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति he exchanges <i>Mashas</i> for these sesamum. In these senses <i>prati</i> governs the Ablative [[2.3.11]]
