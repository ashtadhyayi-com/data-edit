The word सु is कर्म-प्रवचनीय when used in the sense of respect, (when it means 'excellently').
As सुसिक्तं भवता, सु स्तुतं भवता excellently sprinkled by your honor. Well praised by your honor. By not ष being an <i>upasarga</i>, it does not change the स into [[8.3.65]].

Why do we say 'when respect is meant'? Observe सुषिक्तं किं तवात्र has this your place been well sprinkled to-day.
