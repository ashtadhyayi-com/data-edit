These three triads of conjugational affixes, which have received the name of Lowest etc. are called (as regard the three expressions in each triad) severally 'the expression for one' (singular), 'the expression for two' (dual) and 'the expression for many' (plural).
Of the six triads thus formed, each is divided according to number into three classes, viz., singular, dual, and plural.
