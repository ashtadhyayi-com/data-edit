The triads of conjugational affixes and case affixes are also called विभक्ति or Inflective affixes.
The word विभक्ति means a complete triad. Thus सप्तमी विभक्ति means the three affixes of the seventh case, i.e., the locative singular, dual, and plural. So प्रथमा विभक्ति means the third person, singular, dual, and plural.
