Thus it will be stated. 'The indeclinable word यया when not meaning like unto.' Here the word समास must be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. • In fact this chapter and the second chapter treat of compounds and therefore the word compound must be read in all those aphorisms. 

The word <i>prák</i> is employed for the same purpose as it was used in [[1.4.56]] that is to give the designation of समास to various technical terms like अव्ययीभाव &c. which otherwise would not have got the name of समास.
