In this aphorism the word ay is understood from <i>sutra</i>, so that it consists of three words vis, सुप्, सह, सुपा. All these three words jointly and severally, one at a time or two at a time, should be understood as governing the succeeding aphorisms, as the contingency of each <i>sutra</i> may require. This aphorism will constantly be applied in translating the <i>sutras</i> that follow.

Why have we used the word सह? Well, without it the <i>sútra</i> would have stood thus: सह सुपा'a noun may be compounded with another noun.' But this overlooks the case of a compounding with a verb. The word is therefore used so that we may be able to break this composite <i>sútra</i> into two separate and simple <i>sútras</i>, namely:-

(1). सह, सुप्, समस्यते समर्थेन' a case-ipflected word may be com. pounded with a word with which it is connected in sense'. Here the word or with the help of the three words सुप् taken from <i>sútra</i> 2, समस्यते from <i>sútra</i> 3, and समर्थेन from <i>sútra</i> i, forms one complete aphorism, and applies to compounds like अनुव्यचलत् अनुप्रावर्षत . The accent will depend upon these being considered as <i>samasa</i>.

(2). सुपा सह समस्यते a case-inflected word is compounded with another sup-inflected word. The compound which does not fall within any of the various sorts of compounds to be treated of hereafter, will fall under this general head of compounds; as, पुनरुत्स्यूतं वासो  देवं पूनर्निष्ठतो स्थः.. This also is for the sake of accents.
