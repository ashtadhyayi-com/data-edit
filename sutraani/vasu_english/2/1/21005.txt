This is also an  <i>adhikara</i> aphorism like the last. As far as <i>sūtra</i> 21, the compounds treated of, will get the designation of <i>Avyayibhava</i>. The word अव्ययीभाव like the word कर्मप्रवचनीय is a self-descriptive term, and not an arbitrary term like डि,धि  &c. When that which was not an indeclinable becomes an indeclinable, it is called stain or 'becoming an indeclinable'. In the <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound the sense of the first of its elements is the main one or the independent one on which the other depends.
