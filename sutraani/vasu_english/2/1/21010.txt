This समास is restricted to terms applicable to gambling. Thus there is a game called <i>panchiká</i> which is played with fire dice or five ivory pieces When all these five pieces fall with faces turned upward, or all with faces turned down, then the thrower wins the game. But when the fall is otherwise, he loses. Thus अक्षपरि 'an unlucky throw of dice. शलाकापरि, an unlucky throw of ivory pieces '; so also एकपरि 'an unlucky throw by one over' द्विपरि, त्रिपरि  and lastly चतुष्परि.' This is the maximum.' But when Eve are of one form, then of course, he wins.
