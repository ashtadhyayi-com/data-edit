The word <i>lakshana</i> means a sign goal. See also (1. 4. 84) and go for a further explanation of this word. As अभ्यग्नि or अग्निमभिलभाः पतन्ति 'the moths fall in the direction of fire.' So also प्रत्यभि or अग्निं प्रति, the sense being, that making the fire their aims (लक्ष्य) they fall towards it.  

Why do we say 'when meaning <i>lakshana</i>'? Observe स्रुग्घ्नं प्रति गतः 'he turned back and went towards <i>Srughna</i> i.e., having torned back he went only towards the direction of <i>Srughna</i> but not to that place itself.

Why do we say the words <i>abhi</i> and <i>prati</i>? Observe येनाग्निस्तेन गतः 'he went in the direction of the fire' .

Why do we say 'when meaning direction towards'? Observe अभ्यङ्का गावः or प्रत्यङ्कागावः 'the recently marked cows.'
