The word वंश means uninterrupted descent of persons from a common source whether through birth or knowledge. A succession of teachers and pupils, of ancestors and descendants, &c., would constitute a वंश 'family.' One born in or belonging to such a वंश is called a वंश्य or descendant.

As, दिमुनि व्याकरणस्य 'of the <i>Vyakarana</i>,' which has two sages as its principal expounders viz., <i>Panini</i> and <i>Patanjali</i>. So, त्रिमुनिव्याकरणस्य 'having three representatives viz., <i>Pånini</i>, <i>Patanjali</i> and <i>Sakatayana</i> or <i>Katyayana</i>.'

When we desire to express their equality as regards knowledge, then both the words are put in the same case: as द्विमुनि or त्रिमुनि व्याकरणम् .

So also when the relationship is by birth: as, एकविंशति भारद्वाजम् Twenty-one <i>Bharadwajas</i>. These a subsequent compounds are like <i>Dvigu</i>.
