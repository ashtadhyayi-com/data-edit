A word ending with the Ablative -5th case-affix is compounded with the words अपेत 'gone away', अपोध 'carried away', मुक्त 'freed', पतित 'fallen', अपत्रस्त 'afraid of', when the event takes place in a gradual manner and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
As, सुखापेतः 'gone away from pleasure.' कलपनापोढः 'carried away by imagination' चक्रमुक्तः 'freed from the wheel.' स्वर्गपतितः 'fallen from heaven.' तरङ्गापत्रस्तः 'afraid of the waves.' This is an expansion of (II. 1. 32.)

By using the word अल्पशः 'in a gradual degree,' is shown the limited range of this kind of compounds. Not every ablative word can be so compounded. Hence there is no compounding at all in the following cases :- प्रासादात् पतितः, 'fallen from the mansion.' भोजनादपत्रस्तः 'afraid of eating.' For here the fall &c., is violent and sudden, and not gradual and slight.
