As स्तोकान्मुक्तः 'loosed from a little distance.'

So also अन्तिकादागतः 'come from near' अभ्याशादागतः 'come from near' दूरादागतः 'come from far, विप्रकृष्टादागतः 'come from a distance.' कृच्छ्रान्मुक्तः 'saved with difficulty.' कृच्छ्रन् लब्धः 'obtained with difficulty.'

By rule [[6.3.2]] the case-affix is not elided in compounds of this kind.

Vart:- The words शत 'a hundred' and सहस्र 'a thousand' are similarly compounded with the word पर. As, शतात्परे = परश्शताः 'beyond a hundred:' So also परसहस्राः 'beyond a thousand.' In these examples the word शत and सहस्र being exhibited in the 1st case and thus being <i>upasarjana</i> ought to have stood as the first member of the compound [[2.2.30]]; But these compounds are supposed to fall under the class of राजदन्त &c, [[2.2.31]] and hence the <i>upasarjana</i> stands as the second member of the compound. Irregularly is also the augment स (सुद्) interposed between these two words.
