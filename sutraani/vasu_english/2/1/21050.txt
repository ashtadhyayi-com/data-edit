- As पूर्वेषुकामशमी 'the town of <i>Ishukamasami</i> -in-the-east.' अपरेषुकामशमी the town of <i>Ishukamasami</i> -in-the-west.' पञ्चाम्राः 'the five mangoes' सप्तर्षयः 'the seven-sages' (the constellation of the Great Bear),

Why do we say 'when the sense is that of an appellative ?' Observe उत्तरा वृक्षाः 'northern trees.' पञ्च ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' See (IV. 2. 107.)
