That by or to which a thing is compared is '<i>upamana</i>' and the '<i>upameya</i>' (the thing compared) is called सामान्य or 'common'. Thus घनश्याम कृष्णः 'cloud-black Krishna' (Krishna black as a cloud). Here श्याम is a quality common to Krishna and cloud: therefore 'cloud' which is the उपमान is compounded with it. So also कुमुदश्येनी 'lily-white.' हंसगदग्दा 'Swan-sounding' न्यग्रोध-पारिमण्डला 'globular as <i>Nyagrodha</i> tree.' For accent see [[6.2.2]].

But not so in देवदत्ता श्यामा 'black <i>Devadatta</i>' or फला इव तन्दुलाः 'the rice are like fruits' पर्वता इव बलाहकाः 'clouds like mountains'.
