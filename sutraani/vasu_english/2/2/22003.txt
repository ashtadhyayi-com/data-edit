This also debars <i>sūtra</i>9. By the force of the word 'optionally' used here, [[2.2.9]]. also applies. The prohibition contained in [[2.2.11]]. as to the compounding of a genitive with an ordinal, does not apply here; for that rule can find its scope in other ordinals than those mentioned here.

As द्वितीयं भिक्षायाः=द्वितीयभिक्षा  'second begging'. When we apply <i>sutra</i> 9. we have भिक्षादितीयं. So also with the words तृतीयभिक्षा, चतुर्थभिक्षा, तुर्यभिक्षा.

Vari: -The word तुरीय 'fourth' should also be included. As भिक्षातुरीय or तुरीयभिक्षा.

But we cannot form compounds, for reasons given in the last <i>sutra</i>, of the phrases द्वितीयं भिक्षाया भिक्षुकस्य or द्वितीयं भिक्षाणाम् .
