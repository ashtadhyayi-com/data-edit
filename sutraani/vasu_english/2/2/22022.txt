This rule provides for <i>avyayas</i> ending in क्त्वा which the last two rules did not provide. Thus we have उच्चैः कृत्य or उच्चैः कृत्वा. Here the affix क्त्वा is added by <i>sutra</i> (III. 4. 59.) In the case when there is composition, the क्त्वा is replaced by the substitute ल्यप्  ; otherwise not. See (VII. I. 37).

The condition of the <i>upapadas</i> being in the 3rd case &c., applies here also. Therefore there is no composition in अलं कृत्वा or खलु कृत्वा.
