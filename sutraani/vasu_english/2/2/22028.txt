Thus सह पुत्रोणागतः=सपुत्रः ( [[6.3.82]], सह changed to स ) 'he has come accompanied by his son'. सच्छात्रः 'accompanied by the pupil.' सकर्मकरः 'accompanied by the servant.'

Why do we say '<i>tulya</i>-<i>yoga</i>'? Witness 'the she-ass carries the whole burden, though there exist her ten sons.'

How do we get the forms like  सकर्मकः, सलोमकः, सपक्षकः &c., in which there is no '<i>tulya</i>-<i>yoga</i>'? It shows that this condition is of limited operation (तुल्य गोगबचनं प्रायिकं).
