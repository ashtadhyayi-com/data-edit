Ex. पुत्रेण सहागतः पिता 'the father has come with the son.'

The same will be the result with the synonyms of सह as, पुत्रेण सार्द्धं 'with the son'. So also when the word सह is understood, as <i>Panini</i> himself uses in [[1.2.65]] वृद्धो युना &c.

Why do we say 'when not the principal.' Observe, शिष्येण सहोपाध्यायस्य गौः.
