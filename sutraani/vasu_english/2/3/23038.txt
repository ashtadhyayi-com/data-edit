This is Genitive Absolute. रुदतः रुदति वा प्राव्राजीत् 'in spite of her weeping, he went away.' The force of this genitive is that of the English word 'not withstanding' 'in spite of' 'for all,' &c., नन्दाः पशव इव हताः पश्यतो राक्षसस्य 'the <i>Nandas</i> were killed like so many beasts <i>Rakshasa</i> looking on,' (not-with-standing that <i>Rakshasa</i> was looking on).
