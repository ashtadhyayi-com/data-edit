Thus गंगाशोणम् 'the Ganges and the <i>Sona</i>. कुरवः + कुरुक्षेत्रं = कुरुकुरुक्षेत्रं 'the country of the <i>Kurus</i> and the <i>Kurukshetra</i>.' उद्ध्यैरावती कुरुकुरु जाङ्गलम् ॥

Why do we say 'of different genders'? Observe गंगायमुने 'the <i>Gangas</i> or and the <i>Yamuna</i>.' Both being feminine gender, so also मद्रकेकयाः ॥

Why do we say 'rivers and countries'? Observe कुक्कुटमयुर्यौ 'the hen and the pea-hen.'

Why do we say 'not of a town'? See जाम्बबशालूकिन्यौ '<i>Jambaba</i> and <i>Salukini</i>, which are the names of two villages or <i>grama</i>.

We have taken the word 'river,' as the word 'country' does not include 'river.' So also 'mountains' are not included; as कैलासगन्धमादने 'the <i>Kailasa</i> and the <i>Gandbamadana</i>.'

Vart:- The prohibition extends to villages and towns (<i>grama</i>) but not to cities, (<i>Nagara</i>), as मथुरापाटलिपुत्रं 'the cities of <i>Mathura</i> and <i>Pataliputra</i>.'

Vart:- When a compound consists of two words, one a town and the other a city, the prohibition applies; as सौर्यकेतवते 'the city of <i>Saurya</i> and the village of <i>Ketavata</i>.'
