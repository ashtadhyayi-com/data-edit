As, सोशमिकन्थम् 'the town of <i>Sausami</i>'; आह्वरकन्थम् 'the town of <i>Ahwara</i>.'

When not an appellative, the form is different; as, वीरणकन्था. So also if the town is not in the country of the <i>Usinaras</i>, as दाक्षिकन्था.

This debars the rule (II. 4. 25.) by which a compound gets the gender of its subsequent term. (For accent see (IV. 2. 124.))
