As, पाणिन्युपज्ञमाकालापकं व्याकरणम् 'the grammars <i>Kalapa</i> &c., had their commencement with <i>Panini</i>'s invention'; व्याड्युपज्ञं दुष्करणं '<i>Vyadi</i>, invented <i>Dushkarana</i>'; आढ्योपक्रम प्रासादः 'the palace is an invention of rich folks'; मन्दोपक्रमाणि मानानि 'the measures are the invention of king <i>Nanda</i>.'

Of course, when it has not this sense, the neuter gender is not employed; as देवदत्तोपज्ञो रथः 'the chariot made by <i>Devadatta</i>,' यज्ञदत्तोपक्रमो रथः 'the chariot commenced by <i>Yajnadatta</i>.' So also the sense may be that of invention &c., but when these words are not employed, the neuter gender is not used; as वाल्मीकिश्लोकाः 'the <i>slokas</i> invented by <i>Valmiki</i>.' N. P. Prof. Bohthlingk gives पाणिन्युपज्ञमकालकं व्याकरणम् 'The Grammar omitting the time of day is the work invented by <i>Panini</i>, [[6.2.14]].
