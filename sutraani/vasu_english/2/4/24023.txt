As इनसभम् 'the King's Court.' ईश्वरसभम् 'Lord's Court.'

But in राजसभा 'the King's Court,' the word is not neuter; for synonyms of राजा are only to be taken and not the word-form राजा; an apparent exception to Rule [[1.1.68]].

So also रक्षःसभम् 'the Court of the <i>Rakshasas</i>' पिशाचसभम् 'the Court of the <i>Pisachas</i>.'

But in काष्ठसभा, दैवदत्तसभा &c, the word is not neuter; for the word non-human has a technical significance meaning <i>Rakshasa</i> or a monster.
