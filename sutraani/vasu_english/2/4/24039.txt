घस्तान्नूनम् । सग्धिश्चने । (<i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i> <i>Vaj</i> <i>S</i>.XVIII. 9). Sometimes it does not take place; as आतामद्य मध्यतो भेद उद्भृतम्

The word बहुलं is used in this <i>sutra</i> and the word अन्यतरस्याम् in the next. There is evidently difference between the senses of these words; otherwise <i>Panini</i> would not have employed them in such juxtaposition, had they been synonymous. For then the anuvritti of बहुलं in the next <i>sutra</i> would have been sufficient. The following verse indicates that difference.

क्वचित् प्रवृत्तिः क्वचिदप्रवृत्तिः, क्वचिदविभाषा क्वचिदन्यदेव ।
विधेर्विधानं बहुधा समीक्ष्य, चातुर्विध बाहुलकं वदन्ति ॥

'Sometimes they are, where there is no express rule for their application; sometimes they are not applied, in spite of an express rule for their application; sometimes they are optionally employed or not, and sometimes there is some other result, licence permitted by the rule.' Thus in घस्ताम् there is not elision of the penultimate.
