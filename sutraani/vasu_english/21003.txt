From this point up to the aphorism कडाराः कर्मधारये [[2.2.38]], all the terms that we shall say, describe will get the designation of समास or compound
Thus it will be stated. 'The indeclinable word यया when not meaning like unto.' Here the word समास must be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. • In fact this chapter and the second chapter treat of compounds and therefore the word compound must be read in all those aphorisms. 

The word <i>prák</i> is employed for the same purpose as it was used in [[1.4.56]] that is to give the designation of समास to various technical terms like अव्ययीभाव &c. which otherwise would not have got the name of समास.
