The indeclinable word यथा when it does not signify 'likeness' is invariably compounded with a word ending in a case-affix which is in construction with it and the compound is called अव्ययीभाव समास।
Thus यथावृद्धम् ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व  invite every old <i>Brahmana</i>. So also यथाध्यापकम्.

Why do we say 'when not signifying likeness?'. For there is no composition when likeness is indicated. As यथादेवदत्तस्तथा यज्ञदत्तः  As is <i>Devadatta</i>  so is <i>Yajñadatta</i>.

This <i>samása</i> could have been included in the last <i>sútra</i> clause to, but making a separate <i>sútra</i>  shows that the word यथार्थवचन there must be limited by the present <i>sútra</i>, to first three meanings of the word यथा given there and not to its fourth meaning. vis. there is no compounding when it means likeness.
