A word ending in a case-affix is compounded with the indeclinable word प्रति , when meaning 'a little' and the compound so formed is called अव्ययीभाव।
The word नाना means a drop,' 'a little,'  'wee bit;' as, शाकप्रति "a little of vegetable,' सूपप्रति 'a little of soup.'

Why do we say 'when meaning a little'? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतते विद्युत् 'it lightens in the direction of the tree.' Here it is not compounded.

Though the word <i>sup</i> was, by <i>anuvritti</i>  from <i>sútra</i> 2, understood in this <i>sútra</i>, its repetition in the text is for the purpose of indicating that the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word अव्यय which began with <i>sútra</i>  6 does not extend further into the subsequent <i>sútra</i>.

The word प्रतिना being exhibited in the 3rd case-affix is not an <i>upasarjana</i> (l.2.43) and therefore, it comes as the last member of the compound [[2.2.30]].
