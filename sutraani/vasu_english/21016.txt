The word अनु 'alongside of' is optionally compounded with the word indicative of that whose length the particle expresses and compound so formed is called अव्ययीभाव।
As, अनुगङ्गं वाराणसी 'the city of <i>Benares</i> extends alongside the river Ganges' अनुयमुनं मथुरा  <i>Mathura</i>, alongside of the <i>Yamuna</i>, the length of <i>Mathura</i> being measured by that of the <i>Yamuna</i>.'

Why do we say 'length'? Observe वक्षमनु विद्योतते विद्युत्.
