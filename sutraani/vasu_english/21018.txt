The words पार 'across' and मध्य 'middle' may optionally be compounded with a word ending in the 6th-Case-affix, when they take forms परे and मध्ये and the compound so formed is अव्ययीभाव।
Ordinarily these words would have formed Possessive <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds. The present <i>sûtra</i> ordains <i>Avyayibhåva</i> instead. The force of वा in the text is that the Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounding also takes place in the alternative. As पारेगङ्गम् or गङ्गापारम् 'across the Ganges.' मध्येगङ्गम् or गङ्गमध्यम् 'middle of the Ganges.'

Of course according to the option allowed by <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.11]], this compounding need not take place at all, the same sense being expressed by a phrase; as पारं गङ्गायाः or मध्यं गङ्गायाः .
