From this sūtra as far as sūtra [[2.2.23]], the word तत्-पुरुष is governing word, and is understood in all the following sūtras.
From this <i>sutra</i> as far as the <i>sutra</i> [[2.2.23]] relating to <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds, the word <i>Tat-purusha</i> should be read into each <i>sutra</i>. This  big term is of older coinage than that of <i>Panini</i>, being, in fact, made by older grammarians. In the <i>Tat-purusha</i> compound, the sense of the last of its elements is the main one, and governs the preceding one. The <i>Karmadhåraya</i> (Appositional Determinative Compound) and <i>Dwigu</i> (Numeral Determinative Compound) are also sub-divisions of this class of compounds. The rest of this chapter and 22 <i>sůtras</i> of the second, deal with this.
