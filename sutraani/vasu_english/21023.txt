And the compound called द्विगु (Numeral Determinative Compound) is all called तत्-पुरुष ।
The object of making <i>Dwigu</i> a sub-division of <i>Tat-purusha</i> Compound is that the समासान्त affixes and rules given in (V. 4.68-160) should apply to <i>Dwigu</i> also. Otherwise we could well have dispensed with this <i>sutra</i>; as <i>sútra</i> 52 of this chapter already defines <i>Dwigu</i>. Thus पञ्चराज्ञ [[5.4.91]] fem. पञ्चराज्ञी [[4.1.15]], [[4.1.21]], 'an aggregate of 5 princes' द्ववहः, '[[5.4.89]], पञ्चगवम् 'an aggregate of 5 cows.' दशगवम् 'an aggregate of ten cows.' [[5.4.92]]
