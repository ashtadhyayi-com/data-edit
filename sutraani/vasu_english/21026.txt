The word खट्वा in the Accusative -2nd case is compounded with a word ending in the affix क्त , when censure is implied and the compound so formed is तत्-पुरुष ।
The word क्षेप means 'censure,' 'blame' and this sense can be connoted only by the compound word as a whole and not by any of its constituent elements. This compound is also, therefore, a <i>Nitya</i> Compound, though it occurs in the sub-division relating to Optional Compounds :-because it is impossible to analyse such a compound and express, by means of sentence, the sense conveyed by the function of the compound word.

As खट्वारूढः or खट्वाप्लुतः (literally lying on a bed); silly, stupid, going wrong or astray.

There is no compounding when 'censure is not meant.' As खठ्वामारूढः 'lying on a bed.'

Why this word should have this opprobrious meaning, will be understood from the consideration of the following facts :-a person under the <i>Aryan</i> social polity, could only then enter the married state or the life of a house-holder, as it was called, when he had completed his <i>Brahmacharya</i> i.e., the prescribed period of bachelor studentship. All <i>Brahmacharis</i> were bound to sleep on ground and not on खट्वा or cots, so long as they were <i>Brahmacharis</i>. A person who without completing his studies, and without obtaining the permission of his teacher, entered into matrimony, was originally called, in reproach, खट्वारूढः 'who had ascended the couch in an improper way.' Then the term was extended to all persons guilty of vile action.
