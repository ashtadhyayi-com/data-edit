The indeclinable word सामि 'half' is compounded with a word ending in the affix क्त and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
The word सामि being an <i>avyaya</i>, and not denoting any substance, cannot take the affixes of the second or any case. Therefore the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्वितीया would be inapposite in this aphorism.

As सामिकृतम् 'half-done.' सामिपीतम् 'half-drunk' सामिभुक्तम् 'half-eaten.'

The object attained by this <i>samása</i> is the same as in [[2.1.25]], namely, making them one word and taking one accent.
