Words denoting time being in the Accusative -2nd case, are optionally compounded with a word ending in a case-affix, when used in the sense of complete connection throughout with the time (i.e. duration of time) and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष।
The word काल is understood in this aphorism; but not so the phrase 'ending with the affix क्त.'

The word अत्यन्तसंयोग means 'uninterrupted connection.' For accent of these words see [[6.2.2]]

As मुहूर्तसुखम् 'a momentary pleasure.' सर्वरात्रकल्याणी, सर्वरात्रशोभना.
