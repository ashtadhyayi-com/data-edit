A word ending with the Instrumental -3rd case-affix, when it denotes the agent or instrument -- [[2.3.18]], is compounded diversely with what ends with a कृत् affix and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
The word बहुलं shows that there is a general relaxation of all the rules and conditions. As अहिना हतः = अहिहतः 'killed by the snake' नखनिर्भिन्नः 'divided by the nails.' परशुच्छिन्नः' cut by the axe.'

Why do we say 'when denoting the agent or the instrument'? Observe भिक्षाभिरुषितः 'dwelt with alms.' Here the force of the 3rd case is that mentioned in <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.21]] and not that of [[2.3.18]]'

Why do we say 'diversely'? Observe दात्रेण लूनवान् 'cutting with the sickle.' परशुना छिन्नवान् 'cutting with the axe. Here there is no compounding. But there is compounding where otherwise there ought not to be, because of the word बहुलः-- as पादहारकः and गले चोपकः .
