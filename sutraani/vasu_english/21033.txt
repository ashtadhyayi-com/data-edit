A word ending with the Instrumental -3rd case-affix when it denotes the agent or the Instrument, is compounded optionally with a word ending in a कृत्य affix, when exaggerated statement (whether of praise or of censure) is implied and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
As काकपेयानदी 'a shallow river' (so shallow that a crow may dip his beak into it and touch the bottom and drink). श्वलेह्य कूपः 'a shallow well' (so that a dog can lick water from the brink of it). वाष्पच्छेद्यानि तृणानि 'thin grass' (so fragile that it can be cut by vapour) कण्टकसञ्चेय ओदनः .

This <i>sūtra</i> is in a way a prolongation of the last .

Vart:-The phrase 'words ending in a <i>kritya</i> affix' must not be taken universally, only the <i>kritya</i> affixes यत् and ण्यत् are meant in the above <i>sutras</i>. The following are the <i>kritya</i> affixes :- तव्य, अनीय, यत्, क्यप्, ण्यत्, (see <i>sutra</i> III.1.95-132). Therefore there is no compounding when the word ends in तव्य as in काकैः पातव्या.
