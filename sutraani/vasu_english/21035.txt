A word ending with the Instrumental -3rd case-affix and denoting a relish giving or refining ingredient, is compounded with a word meaning, victuals and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
Anything eatable, whether hard or soft, is called भक्ष्य; its refinement is called मिश्रीकरणं. As गुडधानाः  'barley prepared with jaggery;' गुडपृथकाः  'flattened parched rice prepared with jaggery.' 
 The connection here also between the two words is established by a verb understood.
