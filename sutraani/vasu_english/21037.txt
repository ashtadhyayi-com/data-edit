A word ending with the Ablative -5th case-affix is optionally compounded with the word भय 'fear' and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
The phrase सुप् सुपा is understood here, and the <i>sutra</i> qualifies it.

 As वृकेभ्यो भयं=वृकभयं 'fear from wolves,'  चौरभयं 'fear from thieves,' दस्युभयं 'fear from robbers.'

Vart:- So also with the words भीत, भीति, and भीः as वृकभीतः, वृकभीतिः, वृकभीः.
This <i>sutra</i> is an expansion of <i>sûtra</i> 32 and an exposition of the word बहुल there. So that we may have the following compounds also: ग्रामनिर्गतः 'gone out of the village.' अधर्म जुगुप्सुः .
