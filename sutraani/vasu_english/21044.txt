A word ending with the Locative -7th-case-affix is invariably compounded with a word ending in a case-affix, when the compound thus formed is used as an appellative and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
A <i>sanjña</i> is expressed by the complete word, hence it is an invariable (<i>nitya</i>) compound; for we cannot express an appellative by a sentence.

As, अरण्ये तिलकाः 'wild sesamum' yielding no oil; anything which does not answer to one's expectation. So also अरण्ये माषाः, वने किंशुकाः' anything found unexpectedly.' So also वने बिल्वकाः, कूपे पिशाचकाः.

The case-affix is not elided, in this case, in accordance to <i>sútra</i> [[6.3.9]] (The 7th case-affix is not elided after words ending in consonants or in short अ when the compound denotes appellative.)
