The word तत्र 'there' which is a word ending with Locative -7th-case-affix सप्तम्यास्त्रल् [[5.3.10]], is compounded with a word ending in क्त and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
Thus तत्रभुक्तम् 'eaten there.' तत्रकृतं 'done there,' तत्रपीतं 'drunk there.' By making this a compound, the same purpose is served as in <i>sútra</i> [[2.1.25]] namely, these two words form one word and get one accent.
