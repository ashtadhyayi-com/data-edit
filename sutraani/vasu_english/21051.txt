In a case where the sense is that of a तद्धित-affix or when an additional member comes after the compound or when an aggregate is to be expressed, then a word signifying a point of the compass or a number, enters into composition with a case-inflected word which is in agreement with it by being in the same case and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
First let us take the case where the sense is that of a <i>Taddhita</i>-affix. Thus when a compound is formed out of the words पूर्वस्यां शालायां भवः 'that which is in the eastern hall' (in which analytical exposition of the compound in question, the word भव [[4.2.107]] serves to represent the force of a <i>Taddhita</i> -affix) the compound having reached the form of पूर्वा+शाला, the feminine termination of the पूर्वा is rejected, because <i>Patanjali</i> declares that the masculine state belongs to a pronominal when exercising any of the five functions belonging to a word; we have :-पूर्व + शाला + अ [[4.2.107]] = पौर्वशालः (VII.2.117 and VI.4.148) 'who is in the eastern hall.'

So also when an additional member comes after the compound (<i>uttarpade</i>) As, पूर्वशालप्रियः or अपरशालप्रियः 'loving the eastern or western hall.' Those <i>Uttarpada</i> Compounds are invariable (<i>Nitya</i>) compounds, so that they can not be resolved into their component elements.

When a समाहार  'aggregate' is to be expressed, it is of course impossible to use a word expressing points of the compass ( दिक् words ). The following compounds are formed with numbers (सङ्ख्या), when employed with the force of a <i>Taddhita</i> affix; as, पाञ्चनापितिः 'relating to five barbers.' पाञ्चकपाल 'relating to an oblation offered in five cups' (कपाल) [[4.1.88]]. So also पञ्चगवधन [[5.4.92]] 'Whose wealth consists of five cows,' दशगवधनः

The following are examples of aggregates:- पञ्चफली 'the collection of five fruits' [[4.1.21]] दशपूली 'an aggregate of ten bundles,'त्रिलोकी 'the aggregate of the three worlds.' पञ्चकुमारि 'an aggregate of five virgins;' this word is neuter by (II.417.)and the long ई is shortened by [[1.2.47]]
