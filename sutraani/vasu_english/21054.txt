The case-inflected words पाप 'sin' and अणक 'insignificant' are compounded with words expressive of vileness and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
Both the words पाप and अणक are words of contempt (कुत्सन) ; by the last <i>sútra</i>, they would have stood as second members in the compound; the present <i>sútra</i>, however, is so framed with regard to <i>sútra</i> [[1.2.43]] and [[2.2.30]], that they will stand as first. As पापनापितः or अणकनापितःः 'a contemptible barber' पाप or अणक-कुलालः 'a contemptible potter.'
