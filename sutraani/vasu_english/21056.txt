A case-inflected word denoting subject of comparison is compounded with the words व्याघ्र 'tiger' etc., the latter being the standard of comparison and in construction with the former and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ; provided that any word expressing the common characteristic (सामान्य) as explained above, is not used.
This is a modification of <i>sůtra</i> 57, by which the objective would have stood first; by the present, the attribute stands second. As पुरुषोऽयं  व्याघ्र इव = पुरुषव्याघ्रः 'a person-tiger' (in strength) पुरुषसिंहः

In the last <i>sutra</i>, the compounding was between the उपमान  and the common quality. In the present, the compounding is between the उपमित  and certain उपमान but never with सामान्य वचन. Therefore we can not form this kind of compound from the following sentence:- पुरुषो व्याघ्र इव शूरः 'a man strong as a tiger.' Similarly मुखपद्मम्, मुखकमलं, करकिसलयम्, पार्थिवचन्द्रम्॥

The words व्याघ्र  &c. are आकृतिगणः  i. e., this is a class of compound words, the fact of a word belonging to which, is known by its form, a posteriori and is not discoverable by any consideration of its constituent parts a priori.

The following is the list of such words:-  1. व्याघ्र  = A tiger. 2. सिंह  = A lion. 3. ऋक्ष = A bear. 4. ऋषभ = A bull. 5. चन्दन = Sandal. 6. वृक = A wolf. 7. वृष = A bull!. 8. वराह = A boar, hog. 9. हस्तिन = An elephant. 10. तरु  = A tree. 11. कुञ्जर = An elephant. 12. रुरु = A kind of deer. 13. पृषत = The spotted antelope. 14. पुण्डरीक = A lotus flower. 15. पलाश  = A tree Butea Frondosa. 16. कितव = A rogue, cheat.
