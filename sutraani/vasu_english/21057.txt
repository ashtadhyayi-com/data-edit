A case-inflected word denoting the qualifier (the Adjective), is compounded diversely with a case-inflected word denoting the thing thereby qualified, (the Substantive), the latter being in agreement (same case) with the former and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
The 'discriminator' is called विशेषण and the 'discriminated' is called विशेष्य as नीलोत्पलं 'a blue lotus,' रक्तोत्पलं 'a red lotus.'

By using in the rule the expression बहुल ' diversely' it is meant that in some cases it is imperative to make a compound (नित्यसमास) as कृष्णसर्पः 'a black snake.' लोहितशालिः 'red rice':-and sometimes it is forbidden; as, रामो जामदग्न्यः '<i>Rama</i> called also <i>Jamadagnya</i>' (as being the son of <i>Jamadagni</i>): अर्जुनः कार्त्तवीर्यः -and in some cases it is optional, नीलमुत्पलं or नीलोत्पलं. 

Why do we say 'qualifier ?' Observe तक्षकः सर्पः 'the <i>Takshaka</i> snake.'

Why do we say 'qualified.' Observe लोहितस्तक्षकः 'the red <i>Takshaka</i>.'
