The case-inflected words श्रेणी 'class' etc. are compounded with words कृत् 'made' etc. which are in agreement (same case), with them and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
Vart:- The words श्रेणि &c., for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i>, are supposed to have the force of the affix च्वि (<i>chvi</i>). Thus अश्रेणयः श्रेण्यः कृताः= श्रेणिकृताः  'made into classes' (those who were not classified before).

The class of words called कृतादि are <i>akriti-gana</i> and cannot be known a priori. This <i>Samasa</i> is also an invariable <i>Samasa</i> by reason of <i>sutra</i> [[2.2.18]], since all words that end in <i>chvi</i> ( च्वि ) are called <i>gati</i> (1.4. 61.)
