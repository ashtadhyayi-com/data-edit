The words कतर 'which or who of two', and कतम 'which or who of many', when used in asking questions about the genus or class, are compounded with the other case-inflected words with which they are in construction and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
As कतरकठः and कतरकालापः 'which of the two is <i>katha</i>, and which <i>kálápa</i>?' कतरकठः and कतरकालापः 'which of these is <i>katha</i> &c.'

It might be objected, 'what is the use of employing the word जातिपरिप्रश्न in the aphorism; since the word कतम is especially employed in asking such questions; (see V, S. 93) and the word कतर will get the same signification by being read along with it?' The very use of this phrase in the aphorism shows that the word कतम has other meanings besides that of an interrogative pronoun, of determining <i>játi</i>; as कतरो भवतोर्देवदत्तः 'which of you two, Sirs, is <i>Devadatta</i>,' and कतमो भवतां देवदत्तः 'which of you, Sirs, is <i>Devadatta</i>.' Here there is no questioning about <i>játi</i>; all belonging to the same genus, hence there is no compounding. (Accent VI.2.57.)
