The word किम् 'what', when implying 'contempt' is compounded with a word ending in case-affix and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
As किं राजा यो न रक्षति 'he is a bad king who does not protect his subjects.' किं सखा योऽभिद्रुह्यति 'he is a bad friend who hates.' किं गौः यो न वहति 'it is a bad ox that does not carry.'

The affix टच् [[5.4.91]] does not come after this compound as in महाराजः मद्रराजः &c., by force of Rule [[5.4.70]]. Otherwise the form would have been किंराज and not किंराजा.

Why do we say 'when censure is implied?' Observe कस्य राजा = किंराजः 'whose king;' किंसखः
