The word युवा 'young' is compounded with the words खलति 'bald headed', पलित 'grey-haired', वलिन 'wrinkled', जरति 'decayed', when they are in agreement (same case) and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
The word जरतीभि is exhibited in the feminine gender, in the aphorism, with the object of indicating the existence of the following maxim of interpretation प्रातिपदिकग्रहणे लिङ्गविशिष्टस्यापि ग्रहणम्।।

'A <i>Prátipadika</i> denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, also such a crude form as is derived from it by the addition of an affix denoting gender.'

As, युवा + खलतिः = युवखलतिः. So also युवतिः खलती - युवखलती in the feminine: 'bald in youth.' So युवपलितः fem. युवपलिता, 'grey-haired in youth' युववलिनः fem. युववलिना 'wrinkled in youth' यवजरन् fem. युवजरती 'appearing old in youth,' (prematurely old.)
