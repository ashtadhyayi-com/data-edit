Words ending with कृत् -affix and the word तुल्य 'equal' and its synonyms are compounded with words which do not denote genus (जाति) being in the same case with them and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष ।
As, भोज्योष्णम् 'hot food,' भोज्यलवणं 'salt food' पानीयशीतलं 'cool drink,' तुल्यश्वेतः 'equally white,' सदृशश्वेतः 'equally white.' सदृशमहान् 'equally great.'

Why do we say 'when not denoting a genus'? Observe भोज्य ओदनः 'eatable rice.' Here the word भोज्य is used as an Adjective and not as a common noun. Hence there is no compounding even under (Il. I.57).
