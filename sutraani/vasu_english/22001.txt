The words पूर्व 'front', अपर 'near', अधर 'lower', उत्तर 'upper', are compounded when in construction with a word signifying a thing that has parts, provided that the thing having parts is distinguished numerically by unity; and the compound is तत्-पुरुष।
The word <i>ekadhikarana</i> (the unity of substance) is the attribute of or qualifies the word <i>ekadesin</i>. This debars the Genitive <i>Tat-purusha</i> compound ordained by <i>sutra</i> 9 ; which would have placed the words <i>purva</i> &c., last in the compound, whereas being here exhibited in the nominative case [[1.2.43]] and [[2.2.30]], they take the precedence.

पर्व+कायस्य = पर्वकायः 'the front of the body'; अपरकायः 'the back of the body'; अधरकायः 'the lower part of the body '; and उत्तरकायः 'the upper part of the body.'

Why do we say 'what signifies a thing that has parts'? Observe पूर्व नाभेः कायस्य. But not so in पूर्वं छात्राणामामन्त्रय 'invite the fore-most of the pupils': because here the substratum (<i>adhikarana</i>) is not unity (<i>eka</i>). But how do we get the compounds like मध्याह्नः 'noon'; सायाह्नः 'evening'? The word <i>ahna</i> is compounded with every word signifying its parts, because we learn this by inference from <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.110]].
