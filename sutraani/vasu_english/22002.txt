The word अर्द्ध when it signifies exactly equal parts i.e. halves, is always neuter and is compounded with a word signifying a thing that has parts, provided that the thing halved is numerically one; and the compound is तत्-पुरुष।
The word अर्द्ध is neuter when it means exactly equal parts or bisection.

The word एकदेशिन् and एकाधिकरण are understood here. This <i>sutra</i> also debars <i>sutra</i> 9; as अर्द्धपिप्पल्याः = अर्द्धपिप्पली 'a half of the pepper'; अर्द्धकोशातकी 'a half of the <i>Kosátaki</i>.'

Why do we say 'when it is neuter'? Otherwise we have ग्रामार्द्धः 'half the village'? नगरार्द्धः 'half the city.'

The word <i>ekadesin</i> must also be taken here. Thus in the sentence अर्द्धं पशोर्देवदत्तस्य 'a half of the animal is of <i>Devadatta</i>'; we cannot compound the word <i>ardha</i> with <i>Devadatta</i>.

The word <i>ekadhikarana</i> must also be taken here. So we cannot compound अर्द्धं पिप्पलीनाम्  'the half of the peppers.'
