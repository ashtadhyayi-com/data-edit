A word ending with a sixth case-affix is compounded with the word याजक 'sacrificer' etc. and the compound is तत्-पुरुष।
The compound which was ordained by the last aphorism, would have been prohibited by Rule 16 in the case of याजक &c.; hence the necessity of the present aphorism to guard against such a prohibition. As ब्राह्मणबाजकः 'a Brahmana's sacrificer.' क्षत्रिययाजकः 'one who sacrifices for Kshatriyas'.

(याजकादि)
1.याजक. 2. पूजक . 3. परिचारक. 4. परिवेषक. 5. परिषेचक. 6.स्नापक or स्नातक. 7.अध्यापक. 8. उत्साहक or उत्सादक. 9. उद्वर्तक. 10. होतृ.  11. नर्तृ . 12. रथगणक. 13. पत्तिगणक. 14. पोतृ.  15. हतृ. 16. वर्तक.

Vart:-A word in the genitive case is compounded with a word expressing a quality which abides in the former word. As ब्राह्मणवर्णः '<i>Brahmana</i>-caste.' चंदनगन्धः 'sandal-scent.' कपित्थरसः 'the wood-apple juice.'

Vart:-So also with an adjective in the comparative degree ; and the sign of comparison तर is elided. Thus सर्वेषां श्वेततरः = सर्वश्वेतः 'the whitest of all.' सर्वेषां महत्तरः = सर्वमहान्  'the greatest among all.' This '<i>vartika</i>' is an exception in anticipation to the next <i>sutra</i> which prohibits composition, when the genitive has the force of specification. Thus सर्वशुक्ला गौः 'a cow whitest among all.'
