A word in the genitive case is not compounded with another, when the force of the sixth case-affix is that of specification (निर्धारण).
With this sutra, begins a series of exceptions to the composition of words in the genitive case. The separation of one from the many, on account of its genus, attribute and action, is called '<i>nirdharana</i>.' As क्षत्रियो मनुष्याणां शूरतमः 'the <i>Kshatriya</i> is the most powerful amongst men.' कृष्णा गवां संपन्नक्षीरतमः 'the black cow is the most milk-giving amongst cows.' धावन्नधगानां शीघ्रतमः 'the runner is the swiftest amongst walkers.' This form of genitive meaning 'amongst,' is ordained by <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.41]].

Vart:- A word taking a genitive-case by force of any rule other than <i>sutra</i> [[2.3.50]], is never compounded. See <i>sutra</i> 8. Thus the following words are never compounded सर्पिषोज्ञानम् , मधुनोज्ञानम्.
