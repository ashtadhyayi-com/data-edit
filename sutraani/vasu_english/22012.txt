A word ending with sixth case-affix is not compounded with a word ending with the affix क्त , when the force of क्त is to denote 'respect' etc.
The affix क्त is added in the sense of inclination, understanding or respect by <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.188]]. The present <i>sutra</i> alludes to that aphorism when it uses the word पूजाः and puja itself is used only as an illustration and includes the other two significations of '<i>kta</i>' also, namely <i>mati</i> 'inclination,' and buddhi 'understanding.'

As राज्ञां मतः -बुद्धः - पूजितः 'the king wishes, understands or respects.'

Why do we say 'when meaning respect'? When '<i>kta</i>' has not this signification there is compounding. As छात्रहसितं 'pupil's laughing.'
