A word ending with a sixth case-affix is not compounded with a word ending with त्रिच् or अक , when the force of the genitive case is that of an agent.
The word '<i>kartari</i>' qualifies the genitive-case. The affix तृच् is taught in <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.133]], and the affix अक is not a single affix; all affixes that have an element वृ are अक such as ण्वुवुल् or वुञ्  ओर् वुन् ( <i>sutra</i> [[7.1.1]] ) Thus भवतः शायिका 'your honor's repose' भवत आशिका 'your eating' भवतोऽग्रगामिका 'your going in front.'

The affix तृच् is employed always in forming nouns of agency; hence there can be no example of a word in a genitive case having the force of an agent, governing another word also having the force of an agent. They therefore serves no purpose in this aphorism, but applies to the <i>sutra</i>s that follow.

The genitive has the force of an agent under conditions mentioned in [[2.3.65]].

Why do we say 'when it denotes agent'? Observe इक्षुभक्षिकां मे धारयसि .
