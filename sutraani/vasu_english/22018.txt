The indeclinable word कु 'bad' , the particles called गति and the prepositions प्र etc. are invariably compounded with other words with which they are in construction and the resulting compound is तत्-पुरुष।
The word <i>ku</i> means 'badness or sin' ; as, कुपुरुषः 'a sinful man' ; (2) <i>Gati</i> [[1.4.60]] as, उररीकृतं 'having asserted'; [[1.4.61]] यदूरीकरोति ॥

So also with the words प्र &c., when they are mere particles and not used as 'upasargas,' or 'gati'; as दूर् meaning 'bad,' in दुष्पुरुषः 'a bad man'; so also सु and अति meaning 'respect' in सुपुरुषः 'honorable man'; अतिपुरुषः 'excellent man' ; आ means 'a little' as आपिङ्कत्नः 'brownish.'

Generally these are attributive words but they are found elsewhere also, as कोष्यं or कदुष्णम् or कवोष्णन् 'tepid.' So also दुष्कृतम्, अतिस्तुतम् and आबद्धम् ॥
