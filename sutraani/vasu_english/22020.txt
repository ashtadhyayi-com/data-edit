When an उपपद is compounded with an indeclinable, then it is compounded only with those अव्ययs which end in the affix अम्।
This makes a restriction, to the general compounding of <i>upapadas</i> with <i>avyayas</i> as ordained by the last rule. As स्वादुकारं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats having made his food sweet.' So also लवणकारं 'having seasoned. The <i>avyayas</i> ending in अम् are formed by the affix ण्मुल् [[3.4.26]] &c.

Why do we say 'with <i>avyayas</i>       ending in अम्'?  Observe कालो भोक्तुम्  'the time of eating.' Here the <i>avyaya</i> ends in उम् of the affix तुमुन् added by rule [[3.3.167]] (the affix <i>tumun</i> may be applied, when the word in construction is not a verb, but काल, समय or वेला 'time.')

The force of the word only is to indicate that this composition takes place in those cases where a rule ordains अम् only, after any root with regard to any upapada; so that no composition will take place where the affix अम् as well as another affix is ordained after a root with certain <i>upapadas</i>. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.24]], declares: "the affixes क्त्वा and णमुल् come after a verb when the words अमे, प्रथम and पूर्व are <i>upapadas</i>." Here the अम् (affix णमुल्) is not the sole affix ordained; but there is a co-ordinate affix with it namely क्त्वा. Therefore in अग्रेभोजम् 'having first eaten' there is no composition because अग्रेभोजम् is not the only form we can have; for, अग्रेभुक्त्वा is also used in the same sense.
