An उपपद ending in third case-affix [[3.4.47]] etc. is compounded optionally with an indeclinable formed by the affix अम् and the compound is तत्-पुरुष।
The term अम् is understood here. The <i>upapadas</i> ending with a third case-affix &c., are given in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.47]] and the sutras that follow. As मूलकोपदंशं मुङ्क्ते or मूलकेनोपदंशं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats after having relished the food with radish.' So also पार्श्वोपपीड or पार्श्वयोरुपपीडम् शेते (Ill. 4.49) 'he lies pressing on his ribs.' For <i>upapadas</i> ending with other cases, see <i>sutra</i>  [[3.4.52]] &c. This being an optional rule, it is not necessary that the <i>upapada</i> should be <i>tulya-vidhana</i> with the अम् ; so that this optional compounding may take place even under rule [[3.4.59]] where अम् is not the only affix enjoined, but there is क्त्वा as well. This <i>vibhasha</i> may therefore be called both प्राप्त and अप्राप्त <i>vibhasha</i>. It is प्राप्त with regard to those rules where अम् is the only affix employed; and it is अप्राप्त with regard to those where श्रम् is not the only affix.
