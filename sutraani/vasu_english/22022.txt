An उपपद ending in third case-affix or any other of the remaining four cases, is optionally compounded with a word ending with the affix क्तवा and the compound is तत्-पुरुष।
This rule provides for <i>avyayas</i> ending in क्त्वा which the last two rules did not provide. Thus we have उच्चैः कृत्य or उच्चैः कृत्वा. Here the affix क्त्वा is added by <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.59]] In the case when there is composition, the क्त्वा is replaced by the substitute ल्यप्  ; otherwise not. See [[7.1.37]].

The condition of the <i>upapadas</i> being in the 3rd case &c., applies here also. Therefore there is no composition in अलं कृत्वा or खलु कृत्वा.
