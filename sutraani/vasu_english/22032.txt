In a द्वन्द्व compound, let a word called घि [[1.4.7]], stand first.
As हरिहरौ  '<i>Hari</i> and <i>Hara</i>.' So also पटुगुप्तौ and मृदुगुप्तौ. Where there are more than one such for words घि in a compound, any one may be fixed upon as first member, and the rest to follow no fixed rulc, As पटुमृदुशुक्लाः or पदुशुक्लमृदव्ः.

Why do we say '<i>Dvandva</i>'? Observe विस्पष्टपटुः which is Tat-purusha.
