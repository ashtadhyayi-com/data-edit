A word with the seventh case-affix and an epithet are to be placed first in the बहुव्रीही compound.
In a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, all words are <i>upasarjana</i>, and hence there is no rule for their arrangement. The present aphorism declares that rule; as कण्ठेकालः 'who is black in the throat'. So also उरसिलोमा, चित्रगुः, शवलगुः.
