The word अनभिहिते meaning 'not being specified' is to be understood as the governing word.
Whatever will be taught from this point forward, should be understood to apply to those cases which have not been specified otherwise. The case-affixes like those denoting 'object' 'instrument' &c., are applied to a noun, only then, when the force of the case-affix is not otherwise denoted or mentioned or exhibited. The force of a case-affix may be so denoted either by first, the conjugational affixes तिङ्; secondly, by the Primary affixes or कृत्, thirdly, by the secondary affixes तद्धित; or lastly by compounds. Thus <i>sutra</i> 2 declares that the second case-affix is applied in denoting the object, as कटं करोति 'he makes the mat'; ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village.' But the object can otherwise be denoted. Thus by the passive conjugational affix, as कृयते कटः 'the mat is made.' Here the termination of the verb denotes the object. See <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.18]]. and [[3.4.69]]. So also by the <i>krit</i> affix, as कृतः कटः 'the mat is made,' see <i>Sutra</i> [[3.4.70]]. So also by a <i>Taddhita</i> affix as शत्य or शतिकः meaning 'purchased with a hundred' = शतेन क्रीतः. Similarly by <i>samasa</i>, as प्राप्तमुदकं ग्रामम् = प्राप्तोदको ग्रामः ॥
