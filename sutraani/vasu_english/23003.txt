In the छन्दस् (Veda), the object of the verb हु 'to sacrifice' takes the affix of the 3rd case and of the 2nd case as well.
This ordains the third case-affix, and by force of the word च 'and' the second case-affix is also employed as यवाग्वाग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he satisfies or pleases <i>Agni</i> with barley-powder,' or यवागुमग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he throws barley-powder into the fire as oblation.'

Why do we say 'in the vedas?' In the classical Sanskrit, the accusative only must be used and not the instrumental.
