The 3rd case-affix is used after the words denoting the duration of time or place, when the accomplishment of the desired object is meant to be expressed.
मासेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the <i>Anuvaka</i> in a month,' क्रोशेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the <i>Anuvaka</i> by going over a <i>kos</i>.

The word अपवर्ग means 'the finishing of an action, on the attainment of the object intended by the action, but not before.' Thus संवत्सरेणानुवाकोऽधीतः means '<i>Anuvaka</i> was persaveringly and effectually read by him in the whole year.'

When the idea of <i>apavarga</i> is not intended, the accusative case is employed, as मासमधीतोऽनुवाकः 'learnt for a month, but not yet completed, the <i>Anuvaka</i>.'
