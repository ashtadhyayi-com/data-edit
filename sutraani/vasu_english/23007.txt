A noun denoting time or place gets the affix of the 7th or the 5th case when the sense applied is that the time or space is the interval between one action and another (or implies an interval of time and space between कारक-s.
Ex. अद्य भुक्त्वा देवदत्तो द्व्यहे द्व्यहाद्वाभोक्ता 'having dined today, <i>Devadatta</i> will dine in or after two days.' Here the 'time' is the interval between the agent and his power of eating. So also इहस्थोऽयमिष्वासः क्रोशात् क्रोशे वा लक्ष्यं विध्येत् 'standing here, he will hit a mark at the distance of one <i>kos</i>. Here <i>kos</i> is the interval between the agent and the object or the object and the ablation, or the object and the location. The rule (1.3. 10) does not apply here.
