When the word denotes 'cause' it takes the 3rd case-affix.
विद्यया यशः 'by learning there is produced fame.' धनेन कुलम् 'by wealth, family;' कन्यया शोकः 'by daughter there is grief.'

The word हेतु here is used in its popular sense and not the grammatical <i>hetu</i> [[1.4.55]]. Any  thing capable of accomplishing a desired object is called <i>hetu</i>.
