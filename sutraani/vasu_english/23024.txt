A word implying 'debt', considered as a 'cause' but not as कर्तृ or agent, takes the 5th case-affix.
Ex. शताद्बद्धः 'he has been bound on account of a debt of a hundred pieces.'

Why do we say 'when not denoting the agent ?' Observe शतेन बन्धितः; 'a debt of hundred has thrown him in prison'; here शत being considered as a <i>prayojaka</i> <i>hetu</i>, is an agent and takes the third case-affix.
