When a noun is joined with words meaning 'other than' or with आरात् 'near or remote', or इतर 'different from' or ऋते 'without', or words indicative of 'directions' (used also with reference to the time corresponding to them) or with words having अञ्चु 'to bend' as the last member of the compound and expressive of direction, or with words ending with the affix आच् -- दक्षिणादाच् [[5.3.36]] or आहि -- आहि च दूरे [[5.3.37]], the 5th case-affix is used.
Ex. अन्यो, भिन्नो, इतरो, अर्थान्तरं, विलक्षणो  वा देवदत्तात् 'different from <i>Devadatta</i>' आराद् देवदत्तात् 'remote from or near to <i>Devadatta</i>.' The word <i>arat</i> meaning 'near or remote' would have taken the sixth case-affix by <i>sutra</i> 34, but this enjoins 5th case-affix. ऋते देवदत्तात्  'excepting <i>Devadatta</i>.' पूर्वो ग्रामात् 'east of the village,' उत्तरो ग्रामात् 'north of the village,' पूर्वो ग्रीष्मात् वसन्तः 'the spring is prior to summer' प्राक् प्रत्यग्वा ग्रामात् 'to the east or west of the village' दक्षिणा दक्षिणाहि वा ग्रामात् 'to the south or in the eastern direction of the village.'

The words like प्राक् &c., formed from the verb <i>anchu</i> are also दिक्शब्दः; their separate enumeration shows that the sixth case-affix ordained by the next <i>sutra</i> does not come after them.
