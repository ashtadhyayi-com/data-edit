When in conjunction with words having the sense of दूर 'distant' and अन्तिक 'near', the 6th-Case-affix is optionally used.
Ex. ग्रामाद् ग्रामस्य वा वनं दूरं विप्रकृष्टं, अन्तिकं, अभ्याशं, निकटं समीपं वा 'the forest is distant or near or to the village.'

The force of the word अन्यतरस्यां is to indicate that the 5th case-affix employed in the alternative, would have run into this <i>sutra</i>, had we not used '<i>anyatarasyam</i>.'
