After the words दूर 'distant' and अन्तिक 'near', the 2nd case-affix is used as well as the 5th and the 3rd.
Ex. दूरं दूराद् दूरेण वा ग्रामस्य and अन्तिकात्, or अन्तिकेन अन्तिकं ग्रामस्य.

This rule applies only when these words have their original signification and do not denote a substance. Otherwise the proper case-affix should be employed, as दूरः पन्थाः, दूराय पथे देहि.
