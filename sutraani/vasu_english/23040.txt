In conjunction with the words आयुक्त 'engaged', and कुशल 'skilful', when meaning entire absorption in an engagement, the 6th and the 7th case-affixes are used after a word.
Ex. आयुक्तः कुशलो वा कटकरणे कटकरणस्य वा 'deeply absorbed in mat-making.'

When not meaning 'deeply absorbed,' the construction is different; as आयुक्तो गौ शकटे 'the cow is slightly yoked to the cart.' Here the seventh case-affix only is employed.
