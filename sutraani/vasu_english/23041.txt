The 6th and the 7th case-affixes are used after those words from which specification is made, (as of an individual from the whole class).
Ex. गवां गोषु वा कृष्णा बहुक्षीराः 'among cows the black one gives much milk,' मनुष्याणां or मनुष्येषु क्षत्रियः शूरतमः.

A <i>nirdharana</i> or specification is made by separating one from the many by reason of its genus, quality and action [[2.2.10]].
