In conjunction with the words साधु 'good' and निपुण 'skilful' when they denote respect, the 7th case-affix is used, provided that the word प्रति is not used.
मातरि साधुः or निपुणः 'good behaved towards his mother'? But साधुर्देवदत्तो मातरं प्रति '<i>Devadatta</i> is good behaved towards his mother.'

Why do we say 'when respect is denoted'? Observe, साधुर्भृत्योराज्ञः 'the servant is good towards the king.' Here it is a bare statement of a fact.

The exception applies not only to प्रति but to other prepositions, like परि, अनु &c., as, मातरं परि साधुर्देवदत्तः ॥
