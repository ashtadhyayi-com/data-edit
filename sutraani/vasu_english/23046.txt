Where the sense is that of the Nominal-stem -- अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम् [[1.2.45]], or of gender only, or measure only or number only, the 1st case-affix is used.
Ex. उच्चैः 'aloft,' नीचैः 'below,' कुमारी 'virgin,' वृक्षः 'tree,' कूंडं 'owl,' द्रोणः 'a measure'. By 'number' grammatical number is meant; as एकः 'one,' द्वौ 'two,' बहवः 'many'.

The sense of a <i>Pratipadika</i> is to denote mere existence. Genders are three, masculine, feminine and neuter. Measures are such as <i>drona</i>, <i>khari</i>, <i>adhaka</i> &c. Numbers are singular, dual and plural. The <i>Nipatas</i> which do not denote anything are also <i>Pratipadika</i>.
