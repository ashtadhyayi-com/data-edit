In the case of Vocative, the singular number of the 1st case-affix is called स्मबुद्धि।
The vocative singular is called <i>sambuddhi</i>, when it is employed in the vocation. Thus [[6.1.69]] declares 'after an inflectien base ending in एङ् or in a short vowel, a consonant is elided if it be that of '<i>Sambuddhi</i>' as हे राम ॥
