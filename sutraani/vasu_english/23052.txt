Of the verbs having the sense of 'remembering', (अधिक्), and of दय 'to give', 'to pity', 'to protect', 'to move' and of ईश 'to rule or be master of', the object takes the 6th-Case-affix.
Ex. मातुः अध्येति 'he remembers the mother,' सर्पिषो दयते 'he gives clarified butter,' नायं गात्राणामीष्टे 'he can not rule his limbs.' But not so here मातुर्गुणैः स्मरति because गुण here is not the object. The word शेष is also understood here. So that the cases not otherwise provided for, take this case. So that मातरं स्मरति is also allowed.
