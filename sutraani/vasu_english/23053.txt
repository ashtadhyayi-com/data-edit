The object of the verb कृ takes the 6th-Case-affix, when it means 'to impart a new quality or virtue' -- गन्धनावक्षेपणसेवनसाहसिक्यप्रतियत्नप्रकथनोपयोगेषु कृञः [[1.3.32]].
Ex. एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the wood gives a new quality to the water' (or he prepares the wood and water for sacrifice). (By [[6.1.139]], स is inserted).

When प्रतियत्न is not meant, the second case-affix is employed: as कटं करोति.

The word शेष is also understood here. So that we have also एधोदकमुपस्कुरुते ॥
