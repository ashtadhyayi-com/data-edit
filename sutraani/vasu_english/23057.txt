The object of the verbs व्यवहृ and पण् when they ae synonymous, that is when they mean 'dealing in sale and purchase transactions' or 'staking in gambling' takes the 6th-Case-affix.
Ex. शतस्य व्यवहरति or पणते 'he deals in, or stakes hundred.'

Why does not the verb पण take the affix आय् ? It takes आय् when meaning 'to praise or honor,' and not in the sense of 'gambling, or bartering' &c. Not so here शलाकां व्यवहरति 'he throws the dice,' ब्राह्मणान् पणायते 'he praises the <i>Brahmanas</i>.' The word शेष is also here understood, so that we have शतं पणते 'he stakes a hundred.'
