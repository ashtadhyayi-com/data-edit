The object of the verb दिव् when having the above-mentioned sense of 'dealing' or 'stalking', takes the 6th-Case.
Ex. शतस्य दीव्यति 'he stakes or deals in a hundred.' But not in ब्राह्मणं दीव्यति 'he jokes with the <i>Brahmana</i>.'

The <i>yoga</i> <i>vibhaga</i> when this root might well have been included in the last aphorism, is for the sake of the succeeding <i>sutras</i>, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of दिव runs, and not of others.
