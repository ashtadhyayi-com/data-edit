The object of the verb दिव् when having the above-mentioned sense of 'dealing' or 'stalking', optionally takes the 6th-Case, when preceded by an उपसर्ग (preposition).
Ex. शतस्य शतं वा प्रति दीव्यति 'he deals in or stakes a hundred.' But no option is allowed when the verb is simple as in the last aphorism; nor does this rule apply when the sense is not that of dealing or gambling. As, शलाकां प्रति दीव्यति 'he throws the missile.'
