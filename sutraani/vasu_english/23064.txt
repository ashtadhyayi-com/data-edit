The 6th-Case-affix is used in denoting location (अधिकरण) after a word denoting time (काल) when used along with a word ending with an affix having the sense of कृत्वसुच् -- संख्यायाः क्रियाऽभ्यावृत्तिगणने कृत्वसुच् [[5.4.17]] 'so many times'.
Ex. पंचकृत्वोऽऽह्नोभुंक्ते 'he eats five times a day.' In short, 'words meaning so many times, or the numeral adverbs of frequency, govern the genitive of time in the sense of locative.' As द्विरह्नोऽधीते 'he studies twice in a day.'

Why do we say 'having the force of कृत्वसुच् ? Observe अह्नि शेते 'he sleeps in the day.'

This rule will not apply when the adverb of frequency is understood, not expressed (<i>prayoga</i>) as in अहनि भुक्तम्. Nor when the time is not meant, as द्विः कांस्यापात्र्यां भुंक्ते 'he eats in two brass vessels.' So also when location is not meant : as द्विरह्नो भुंक्ते. The शेष being understood we have द्विरहन्यधीते.
