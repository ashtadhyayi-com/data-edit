The past participle ending in क्त is used with the Genitive 6th-Case, when the former expresses location -- क्तोऽधिकरणे च ध्रौव्यगतिप्रत्यवसानार्थेभ्यः [[3.4.76]].
This also is an exception to the prohibition about <i>Nishtha</i> contained in [[2.3.69]]. As इदमेषामासितम् 'this is their seat.' इदमेषां शयितं 'this is their sleeping.'

In connection with verbs taking two objects, both take the genitive case, when a word ending in <i>krit</i>-affix denotes the agent, as they would have taken the accusative : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामस्य चैत्रः '<i>Chaitra</i> is the leader of the horse of the village.' When, however, one is the principal, then the object takes the genitive : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामं चैत्रः, '<i>Chaitra</i> leads the horse to the village.'
