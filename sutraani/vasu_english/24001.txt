All affixes after the verb गाङ् 'to study' and the verb कुट् 'to be crooked' and the rest, are as if they had an indicatory ङ् (ङित्), except those affixes which have an indicatory ञ् (ञित्) or ण् (णित्).
The word एकवचन is a genitive <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i> compound meaning 'the expression for one,' that is to say, it expresses the sense of unity. The rule therefore, enjoins that the sense inherent in a <i>Dvigu</i> compound is that of unity.

This is confined to <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i> i.e., an aggregate compound taken in a collective sense. As, पञ्चगवं 'an aggregate of five cows', पञ्चपली (IV.1.21.). The sense of <i>Dvigu</i> being that of one, it follows that it retains the singular number even when further modified by other affixes, and used as an attributive and though no longer a <i>Dvigu</i>, as, पञ्चपूलीयं शोभना ॥
