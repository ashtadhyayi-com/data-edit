A द्वन्द compound of words signifying small animals, is singular.
Thus यूकालिक्षम् 'the louse and the nil'; दंशमशकम् 'the bug and the mosquito.' The word क्षुद्रजन्तु means an animal of a very small size. Some say that animals not having bones are called क्षुद्रजन्तु, (invertebrates); others say, those which are small in size; others say, all below the mongoose are <i>kshudrajantu</i>.
