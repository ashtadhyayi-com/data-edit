A द्वन्द compound of words signifying those animals only among whom there is permanent enmity i.e. natural and eternal antipathy or quarrel, is singular.
The word विरोध means enmity: and शाश्वतिकः means permanent.

Thus, मार्जारमूषकम् 'the cat and the rat'; श्वशृगालम् 'the dog and the jackal'; अहिनकुलं 'the snake and the mongoose.'

Why do we say 'natural and eternal'? Observe गौपालिशालंकायनाः कलहायन्ते '<i>Gaupali</i> and <i>Salankayana</i> are quarrelling.'

The force of the word च in the aphorism is that of एव 'only.' <i>Dvandva</i> compounds of such animals only are invariably singular; no other rule, even if otherwise applicable, would apply to such compounds. Thus rule [[1.4.12]] says that <i>Dvandva</i> compounds of beasts and birds, is optionally singular. That rule (by [[1.4.2]]) would have set aside the present rule. But च prevents that, and no optional plural number is allowed in case of beasts or birds that are naturally at war; as अश्वमहिषम् 'the horse and the buffalo'; काकोलूकम् 'the crow and the owl.'
