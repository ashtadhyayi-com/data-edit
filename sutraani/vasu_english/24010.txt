A द्वन्द compound of words denoting those classes of शुद्रा-s who have not been expelled from the communion of higher classes, is singular.
Thus, तक्षायस्करम् 'the carpenter and the blacksmith'; रजकतन्तुवायम् 'the washerman and the weaver.'

The word अनिर्वासित means one not expelled (from the dish).

A <i>Sudra</i> who can take food from the dish of a higher class, without permanently defiling that vessel, is called an <i>Anirvasita</i> <i>Sudra</i>.

Why do we say 'not expelled'? Observe चण्डालमृतपाः 'the <i>Chandala</i> and the <i>Mritapa</i>.'
