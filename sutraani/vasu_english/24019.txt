A तत्-पुरुष compound, with the exception of that which is formed by the particle नञ् , and or the कर्मधारय compound, becomes neuter gender, in the cases explained in the following sūtras.
This is a governing <i>sutra</i> and regulates the sense of the succeeding aphorisms which show when a <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i> may be neuter. Thus, ब्राह्मणसेनम् or ना [[2.4.25]]; but दृढसेनो राजा (the compound not being <i>Tat</i>-<i>purusha</i>); असेना (it being a compound with नञ् = अ); and परमसेना (it being <i>Karmadharaya</i>).
