When denoting an appellative, a तत्-पुरुष compound ending with the word कन्था 'town', is neuter in gender, provided that it is the name of a town situated in a country of the उशीनर-s.
As, सोशमिकन्थम् 'the town of <i>Sausami</i>'; आह्वरकन्थम् 'the town of <i>Ahwara</i>.'

When not an appellative, the form is different; as, वीरणकन्था. So also if the town is not in the country of the <i>Usinaras</i>, as दाक्षिकन्था.

This debars the rule [[2.4.25]] by which a compound gets the gender of its subsequent term. (For accent see [[4.2.124]])
