The clause 'when the affix is आर्धधातुक is understood in the following sūtras up to sūtra [[2.4.58]].
Thus it will be taught in <i>sutra</i> (2.4. 42),' that वध् is the substitute of हन् when लिङ् follows.' The words 'when the affix is <i>ardhadhatuka</i>' must be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. The result will be that in the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> लिङ् namely the आशीर्लिङ् or the Benedictive mood, हन् is replaced by वध्, but not so in the <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> लिङ् i. e., the Potential mood (विधिलिङ्). Thus, Benedictive वध्यात् 'may he kill'; but Potential हन्यात् 'let him kill.'

The word आर्द्धधातुके is in the 7th case; the force of this case-affix here is not that given in (l. 1.66). i. e., the <i>sutra</i> does not mean 'when an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix follows.' But the 7th case has the force of indicating the subject, the meaning of the <i>sutra</i> being 'when the subject is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix.' The result of this explanation is, that the various substitutions enjoined hereafter should be made first, and then the respective affixes should be applied. Thus whenever we want to affix any <i>ardhadhatuka</i>-affix to अस् 'to be,' we must first substitute भू for it, and then take the proper <i>ardhadhatuka</i>-affix which would come with regard to भू. Thus we can apply यत to भू by rule [[3.1.97]] which says: 'after verbs ending in vowels यत is applied.' But this affix could never have been applied to अस् which ends in a consonant. Thus we have भव्यम्. So the substitution does not depend upon any particular affix, but <i>ardhadhatuka</i>-affixes as a class.
