बध् is the substitute of हन् 'to kill' when the आर्धधातुक लिङ् (Benedictive) follows.
वध्यात् 'may he kill,' वध्यास्ताम् 'may they two kill,' वध्यासुः 'may they all kill.'

The substitute वध्, ends with short अ this अ is elided. This elision being like the original (<i>sthanivat</i> [[1.1.56]]), in forming the Aorist, लुङ्, we have अवध् + ० + ईत् = अवधीत्. Here zero being <i>sthanivat</i> prevents the <i>vriddhi</i> of अ of व which otherwise would have take place by [[7.2.7]].
