गा is the substitute of the root इण् when लुङ् (Aorist) follows.
अगात् 'he went' [[2.4.77]] अगाताम् 'they two went' जगुः 'they all went.' The repetition of the words लुङ् in this <i>sutra</i> though is <i>anuvritti</i> was coming from the last aphorisms, indicates that there is no option allowed even in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, गा being the invariable substitute in all the <i>Padas</i>. Thus अगायि भवता 'you, went.' The form अगात् is thus evolved आ + गा + सिच् + त् =, जगात् [[2.4.77]]

Vart:- गा is the substitute of इक् 'to remember' in the Aorist as it is of इण्. Thus अध्यगात् 'he remembered.' अध्यागाताम्, अध्यगुः. The root इक् belongs to <i>Adadi</i> class.
