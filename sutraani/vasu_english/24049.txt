गाम् is the substitute of इङ् when लिट् (Perfect Tense) follows.
The substitute being like its original [[1.1.68]] गाङ् would have been <i>Atmanepadi</i>, even without the indicatory, ङ्. Why has then this ङ् been added to it? The object is that in the <i>sutra</i> (1.2. 1.) गाङ् there should mean this substitute गाङ् and not the verb 'to go.'

Thus we get अधिजगे 'he studied'. अधिजगाते, अधिजगिरे. See [[6.4.64]] and [[3.4.8]].
