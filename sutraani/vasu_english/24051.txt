गाङ् is optionally the substitute of इङ् is the causative णि , when that causative takes the affix सन् (Desiderative) and चन् (Aorist).
अधिजिगापयिषति or अध्यापिपयिषति 'he desires to teach.' The form is thus evolved : गा + णिच् = गापि [[7.3.36]]; then by the rules already stated, we get the above form with the affix सम्. अध्यजीगपत् or अध्यापिपत् 'he taught.' The ई is changed into आ by [[6.1.48]]. Thus इ + णिच् = आ + णिच् = आ + प् + इ = आपि. This rule applies to the desideratives of causatives and aorist of causatives.
