वचि is the substitute of ब्रू 'to speak' when any आर्धधातुक affix is to be supplied.
वक्ता 'he will speak,' वक्तुम् 'in order to speak.' The इ of वचि is for the sake of articulation only. The substitute being like the principal, वच् is <i>Atmanepadi</i> when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, as ऊचे 'he spoke,' वक्ष्यते 'he will speak.'
