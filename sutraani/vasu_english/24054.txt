ख्याञ् is the substitute of चक्षिङ् 'to perceive, to tell', when any आर्धधातुक affix is to be applied.
आख्याता 'he will perceive or tell'; अख्यातुम् 'in order to tell;' अख्यातव्यम् 'must be told.' The substitute being like the principal, चक्षिङ् being always <i>Atmanepadi</i> [[1.3.12]], ख्याञ् would have also been always <i>Atmanepadi</i>. But in that case the letter ञ् would have no scope; it therefore follows that ख्याञ् is not always <i>Atmanepadi</i>, but under conditions mentioned in [[1.3.72]].

Vart:- This substitute is also said to begin with क्श instead of ख्य. Thus अक्शाता, आक्शातुम्, आक्शातव्यं.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated when meaning 'exclusion'; as दुर्जनाः संचक्ष्याः 'bad men should be excluded.'

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated when the affixes अस and अन follow : as नृचक्षा राक्षसः 'the <i>Rakshasas</i> are cruel.' This is Vedic Sanskrit; modern नृचक्षः. The meaning of the root चक्ष् here, is 'to injure.' So also निचक्षणः पण्डितः; here the affix is अन.

Vart:- Substitutes are made diversely in denoting appellatives and not qualities and in the Vedic Sanskrit; as अन्नम् 'food' (here the substitute जग्धि does not replace अद); वधकम् 'killer' (वध being substituted for हन् before ण्वुल्); गात्रं 'body' (गा is substituted for इण before the <i>unadi</i> affix ष्टन्); विचक्षणः (here चक्ष is not replaced by ख्या before अन); अजिरम् 'a court yard' (here अज is not replaced by व्यै as the next <i>sutra</i> 56 requires.)
