ख्याञ् is optionally the substitute of चक्षिङ् when लिट् (Perfect Tense) follows.
The लिट् also is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix and by the last <i>sutra</i> ख्या would always have been the substitute of चक्ष्; the present <i>sutra</i> makes this substitution optional, as आचख्यौ, आचख्यतुः and आचख्युः. In the alterative we have आचचक्षे, आचचक्षाते and आचचक्षिरे 'he told &c.'
