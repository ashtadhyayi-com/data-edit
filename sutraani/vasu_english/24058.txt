After a word ending with the गोत्र affix ण्य -- कुर्वादिभ्यो ण्यः [[4.1.151]] and after a गोत्र word denoting the descendant of a क्षत्रिय or a ऋषि 'seer' and after a word ending with a गोत्र affix having an indicatory ञ् , the affix ञ् , the affix अण् and इञ् employed in the forming युवन् -- जीवति तु वंश्ये युवा [[4.1.163]], descendants, are elided by the substitution of लुक्।
1. Thus by <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.151]] (the affix ण्य comes after कुरु &c., in denoting descendent) we get कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः [[7.2.117]] 'a grandson of <i>Kuru</i>.' This is a <i>Gotra</i> word [[4.1.162]]. Now in forming a word denoting a lower descendent than grandson, we add a <i>Yuvan</i> affix. Thus कौरव्य + इञ् [[4.1.95]]. Now this इञ् is elided by the present <i>sutra</i>, and we get the form कौरव्यः which thus means both a <i>Gotra</i> and a <i>Yuvan</i> [[4.1.163]] descendent of <i>Kuru</i>. So that कौरव्यः is the name both of the father and the son.

Now it may be objected : 'the word कौरव्यः belongs to the तिकादि class and by [[4.1.154]], it will take the affix फिञ्. Do we, what we may, the form will be कौरव्यायणिः (VII.1.2.') To this we reply, the word कौरव्यः which we see in that list of तिक् &c., is not the word कौरव्यः which we formed by adding ण्य under rule [[4.1.151]]; that <i>Tikadi</i> word is formed by adding ण्य under rule [[4.1.172]], and is confined to <i>Kshatriya</i>. The कौरव्यः which we have taken, denotes a <i>Brahmin</i> <i>Gotra</i> formed by [[4.1.151]].

2. Now to give an example of a word denoting the descendent of a <i>Kshatriya</i>. We take [[4.1.114]] which tells us that 'the affix अण् may be added to the words which are the names of <i>Rishis</i>, or of persons belonging to the family of <i>Andhaka</i>, or <i>Vrishinis</i> or <i>Kuru</i>.' The <i>Andhaka</i> family, is a <i>Kshatriya</i> family, and श्वफल्कः is a person of that family. Then श्वफल्क + अङ् = श्वाफल्कः 'a descendent of <i>Svaphalka</i>' This is a <i>Gotra</i> descendent. In forming <i>Yuvan</i> descendent we have श्वाफल्क + इञ्. Now this इञ् must be elided by the present <i>sutra</i>. So that श्वाफल्कः means both father and the son.

3. Now to give an example of <i>Rishis</i> family. The <i>sutra</i> last mentioned [[4.1.114]] will also hold here. We take the word वसिष्टः; and वसिष्ट + अण् = वासिष्ठः; the <i>Yuvan</i> affix इञ् will similarly be elided after his; and thus the word वासिष्ठः means both the father and the son.

4. Then to take the example of <i>Gotra</i> word formed by affixes having indicatory ञ्. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.104]] declares 'the affix अञ् comes after the words विद् &c., in denoting <i>Gotra</i> descendents.' Thus विद + अञ् = वैदः; Then add इञ् to denote <i>Yuvan</i> descent, and we have वैदः + इञ्. By the present rule this इञ् is elided and thus we have वैदः both for the father and the son.

The above examples show the elision of the affix इञ्. Now we shall give example of the elision of the affix अण्. Now rule [[4.1.154]] says 'the affix फिञ् comes after the words तिक् &c., in denoting descendent.' Thus तिक + फिञ् = तैकायनिः [[7.1.2]] Then to form the <i>Yuvan</i> descended we add अण् by [[4.1.83]]. Thus तैकायनि + अण्. By the present <i>sutra</i>, this अण् is elided, and we have तैकायनिः both applicable to the father and the son. Other examples can be multiplied.

Why do we say 'there is elision only after these words'? The <i>Yuvan</i> affix will not be elided after other words. Thus rule [[4.1.112]] says:- 'The affix अण् comes after शिव &c., in forming <i>Gotra</i>. कौहड + अण् = कौहड. Now this is neither a word formed by ण्य nor is it the name of a <i>Kshatriya</i> or a <i>Rishi</i>; nor any affix having ञ goes to form it. Therefore the <i>Yuvan</i> affix इञ् will not be elided after this. Thus कौहड + इञ् [[4.1.95]] कौहडिः 'son of <i>Kauhada</i>.'

Why do we say 'affix denoting <i>Yuvan</i> descendent is elided'? An affix not denoting a <i>Yuvan</i> descendent will not be elided. Thus the pupils of वामरथ्य are called वामरथ्याः which word is thus formed: वामरथ + ण्य = वामरथ्यः 'a descendent of <i>Vamaratha</i>' [[4.1.115]]. Then to denote pupils we add अण् by [[4.2.111]]. Thus वामरथ्य + अण् = वामरथ्यः 'a pupil of <i>Vamarathya</i>.'

Why do we say '<i>Yuvan</i> affix अण् and इञ् are elided'? The other <i>Yuvan</i> affixes under similar circumstances are not elided. Thus the <i>Yuvan</i> descendent of दाक्षि (grandson of दक्ष) will be दाक्षायणः Here the affix फक् [[4.1.101]] is not elided.

Vart:- All <i>Yuvan</i> affixes are elided after <i>Gotra</i> words not denoting Brahmin <i>Gotras</i>; as वौधिः applies equally to father and son; जाबालिः father, जाबालिः son; औदुम्बरिः father, औदुम्बरिः son; भाण्डीजङ्घेः father, भाण्डीजङ्घेः son. Here, first इङ् is added by [[4.1.173]], then फक् to denote <i>Yuvan</i> descendent. Then this फक् is elided by the present <i>Vartika</i>.
