There is लुक् elision of तद्राज -- ते तद्राजाः [[4.1.174]], affix, when the word is used in the plural number, provided that the plural number is taken by the base itself and not by its standing as a compound epithet dependent upon another word and provided that the base is not used in the feminine.
आङ्गः = अंग + अण् [[4.1.170]] 'a prince of <i>Anga</i>'; अङ्गाः 'the princes of <i>Anga</i>.' The affix अण् is elided by present rule, and the <i>Vriddhih</i> vanishes with it too [[1.1.63]]; but आङ्ग्यः 'the princesses of <i>Anga</i>,' plural of आंगी 'a princess of <i>Anga</i>.' But प्रियवांगः 'he to whom the prince of <i>Vanga</i> is beloved' forms its plural प्रियवांगाः 'they whose beloved is the prince of <i>Vanga</i>,' there being no elision.
