There is लुक् elision of the गोत्र affixes अण् and यञ् of the words अगस्त्य , and कौणडिन्य , when they take the plural and the words अगस्ति and कण्डिनच् are the substitutes of the bases so remaining after the elision.
The plural of आगस्त्य is अगस्तयः (as if it was the plural of अगस्ति) and of कौण्डिन्यः is कुण्डिनाः. The affix अण् [[4.1.114]] after आगस्त्य and the affix यञ्  [[4.1.105]] after कौण्डिन्य are elided.

The च in कुण्डिनच् is indicatory and regulates the accent [[4.1.163]]; the word कुण्डिन has <i>udatta</i> on the middle vowel; and its substitute will also have the same accent. There is no elision however in आगस्तीयाश्छात्रा [[4.1.89]] कौण्डिनाश्छात्राः (IV. 2. III).
