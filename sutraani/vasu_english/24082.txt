There is लुक् elision of आप् (the feminine termination) and सुप् (the case-affixes) after an अव्यय or indeclinable.
Thus, तत्र शालायाम् 'in that hall'. Here the Indeclinable तत्र 'there,' does not take the feminine termination, although it is equivalent to तस्याम् 'in that.' So also कृत्वा 'having done' हित्वा &c. Here the case affix is elided.
