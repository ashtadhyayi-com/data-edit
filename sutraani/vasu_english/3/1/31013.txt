Thus लोहितायते or लोहितायति 'he becomes red'; पटपटायते or पटपटायति 'he makes a noise like <i>patapata</i>'; (लोहित + य = लोहिता + य = लोहिताय, [[7.4.25]]).

The word पटपटायते is formed by adding the affix <i>dach</i> to the word पट which is first reduplicated, and then takes the denominative affix <i>kyash</i>. The affix <i>dach</i> is added to express inarticulate sounds.

There is no special class called <i>lohitadi</i>. The <i>Vartika</i>, therefore, proposes that the <i>sutra</i> should read without the word <i>adi</i>, as लोहितादिभ्यः क्यष्; 'the affix <i>kyash</i> comes after <i>lohita</i>, and words ending in <i>dach</i>'.

This rule applies to words other than भ्रिशादि which are always invariably <i>Atmanepadi</i> owing to the ङित्, affix क्यङ्, while क्यष् is optionally both. [[1.3.90]]. Thus वर्मायति or वर्मायते, निद्रायति or निद्रायते, करुणायति or करुणायते, कृपायति or कृपायते. The <i>lohitadi</i> is an आकृतिगण, the following being some of the words of this class; लोहित, नील, हरित, पीत, मद्र, फेन and मन्द.

The indicatory क in क्यष् is not for the sake of prohibiting <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> [[1.1.5]]. For <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> takes place in a <i>dhatu</i> followed by a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> or <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. The affix क्यष् is not added to a <i>dhatu</i> but to a nominal stem : hence there is no scope for the operation of <i>guna</i> &c. The क is for the sake of grouping क्यच्, क्यङ् and क्यष् in one class as क्य; as in <i>sutra</i> नः क्ये [[1.4.15]]. There is, however, no word ending in न among those enumerated above.

The affix डाच् [[5.4.57]] comes when the verb following is one of the three अस्, भू, or कृ; as पटपटाकरोति, -भवति or -स्यात्. The present <i>sutra</i> teaches by implication that when क्यष् follows डाच्, the above restriction, that the verb should be कृ, भू or अस्, is not applicable. Here डाच् comes without the addition of कृ, भू or अस्ति.

The <i>anuvritti</i> of अच्वेः comes from the last <i>sutra</i>; and hence the affix मयप् is added in the sense of अभूततद्भाव i.e. something becoming that which it was not before.
