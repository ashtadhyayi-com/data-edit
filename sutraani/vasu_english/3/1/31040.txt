After the above verbs formed by taking the augment आम् the perfect tense of कृ is added to form their Perfect. This has already been illustrated in the above examples. The word कृ includes also the verbs भू and अस्. All these three may be used as auxiliaries. The verb अस् when used as an auxiliary, is not replaced by भू [[3.4.52]] before the लिट् affixes which are <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes. Thus पाचयाञ्चकार, पाचयाम्बभूव, पाचयामास.
