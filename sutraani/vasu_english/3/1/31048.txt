The ङ prevents <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i> and च is to distinguish it from अङ्. When चङ् is added, there is reduplication (VI. I. II). The usual terminations of the Imperfect are employed after the root, when चङ् is used; as अचीकरत् 'he caused to make'; अशिश्रियत् 'he served or went'; अदुद्रुवत् 'he ran'; असुस्रुवत् 'it flowed'. This form is not used in Passive; as, अकारयिषाताम्.

The root कम् 'to love' should also be included in this rule. कम्, when it takes the affix णिङ् (III. I. 30) will of course be included in this <i>sutra</i>, by virtue of its ending in णि; the <i>Vartika</i> makes the additional statement that even when the root कम् does not take the affix णिङ्, the present aphorism must apply to it. Thus we have अचकमत् 'he loved'; when it takes णिङ्, the Aorist will be अचीकमत् (VII. 4. 93, 79, 94.)
