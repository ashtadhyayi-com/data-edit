In forming Impersonal and Passive verbs, this affix is employed in the conjugational tenses. Thus in Impersonal verbs आस्यते भवता 'you sit', शय्यते भवता 'you lie'. So in passive verbs; as क्रियते कटः and गम्यते ग्रामः. The क of यक् is servile, and prevents <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i>. This affix is also used in reflective voice (कर्म्मकर्त्तरि); as क्रियते कटः स्वयमेव 'the mat becomes made of itself'.
