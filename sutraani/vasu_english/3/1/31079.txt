This debars शप्. As तन् + उ + ति = तनोति 'he expands'; कृ + उ + ति = करोति 'he makes'. Though the root कृ is included in the list of the <i>Tanadi</i>verbs, for which see <i>Dhatupatha</i>, yet its separate enunciation in the present <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of making a restrictive rule with regard to this verb; that is to say, the root कृ is a <i>Tanadi</i>root only for the purposes of taking the affix उ; all the other operations of <i>Tanadi</i>verbs are not to be performed upon it. Thus the rule (II. 4.79.) does not apply to कृ. Thus अकृत and अकृत्याः; the सिच् elision being compulsory and not optional.
