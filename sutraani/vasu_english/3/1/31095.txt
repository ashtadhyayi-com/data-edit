From this sūtra up to ण्वुल्तृचौ [[3.1.133]] all the affixes treated will get the name कृत्य।
This defines the class of affixes known as <i>kritya</i>, a subdivision of <i>krit</i> affixes. These are certain affixes like तव्य, अनीय &c, which may be treated as declinable verbal terminations. [[3.4.70]]. The following 38 <i>sutras</i> treat of these affixes. These verbal adjectives correspond in meaning to the Latin participles in <i>udus</i> conveying the idea that the action expressed by the verbs ought to be done or will be done. The word formed by them may be called Passive Potential Participles or Future Passive Participles. The illustrations will be given hereafter under each affix as taught. The word <i>kritya</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> (II. I. 33), [[2.3.71]] &c.
