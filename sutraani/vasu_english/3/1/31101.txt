The words अवद्य , पण्य , वर्या are irregularly formed, having the sense of 'condemnable', saleable' and unobstructable', respectively.
Thus, अवद्यं पापं 'censurable sin'. Another and regular form is अनुद्यम्. This is formed by adding the affix क्यप् to the root वद् by (III. I. 106). So also पण्यः कम्बलः 'saleable blanket'; पण्याः गौः 'saleable cow'. The other and regular form is पाण्यम्, formed by the addition of ण्यत्. So also शतेन वर्या 'unobstructed by hundred'; सहस्रेण वर्या 'unobstructed by thousand'. The other and regular form is वृत्या from the root वृ 'to choose'. वर्या means a girl choosing her own husband and is non-obstructable by any body. The word वर्या in the <i>sutra</i> is in the feminine gender, and it is in this gender only that the word is so formed. In the masculine gender, the word is regularly formed; thus वार्या ऋत्विजः.
