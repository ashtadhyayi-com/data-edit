Thus खन् + क्यप् = ख + ई + य = खेयम् 'to be dug'. The long ई is used in the <i>sutra</i> for the sake of euphony. The same purpose would have been served by using short इ, thus 'इ च खनः'. But the long ई indicates that the rule [[6.4.43]] does not apply here. By that rule the अ of खन् would have been lengthened into आ before the affix क्यप्.
