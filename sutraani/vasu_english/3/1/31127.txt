The word आनाय्यः is irregularly formed when meaning 'impermanent'.
This word is thus formed:- आङ् + नी + ण्यत् = आ + नै + य = आनाय्य, (the ऐ being changed into आय् by the analogy of (VI. I. 79)).

As आनाय्यो दक्षिणाग्निः. This is a species of <i>Dakshiņagni</i> fire. As this fire is brought from the <i>Garhapatya</i> fire and is not permanently kept alive, therefore it is called <i>anayya</i>. This however, is not co-extensive with <i>Dakshiņagni</i>. It is that fire which is brought from the <i>Garhapatya</i>, and has the same source with the <i>Dakshiņagni</i> and <i>Ahavaniyagni</i>. A <i>Dakshinagni</i> fire may be taken from different sources, as from the family of a well-to-do <i>Vaishya</i>, or from a frying place, or from <i>Garhapatya</i> fire. When it is taken from the last i. e. from <i>Garhapatya</i> fire, it is <i>anayya</i> <i>Dakshiņagni</i>. <i>Ahavaniya</i> is also taken from <i>Garhapatya</i>.

It is not everything, that is not lasting, which is called <i>anayya</i> ; for a fragile pot will not be called so. It applies only to the consecrated fire. When it has not this sense, the form is आनेय meaning 'what ought to be brought'.
