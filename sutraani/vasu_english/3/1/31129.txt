These words are supposed to be formed thus:- मा (to measure) + ण्यत् = पाय्यम्, the म being changed into प and another य being added by [[7.3.33]]. The regular form is मेयम् 'to be measured' (मा + ण्यत् = मे + य [[6.4.65]] = मेय). सम् + नी (to lead) + ण्यत् = सान्नाय्यम् 'the oblation'. It being a crude form applies to a particular kind of oblation. The regular form is सन्नेयम् । नि + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् = नि + चै + य = नि + चाय + य = निकाय्यः 'a dwelling'. The regular form is निचेय । धा (to put) + ण्यत् = धाय्या (fem.). The <i>samadheni</i> is the name of certain <i>Rik</i> hymns used as supplemental verses in a Litany. The other form is धेय ।
