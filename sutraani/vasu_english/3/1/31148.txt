The verb हा denotes two verbs हाक 'to abandon' and हाङ् 'to go' both belonging to the Third Conjugation, forming जहाति and जिहीते as 3rd per. sing. Thus हा + ण्युट् = हायनः 'a kind of rice' (that which <i>jahati</i> 'leaves off' all water) हायनः 'a year' (that which jihite 'goes through' all conditions.)

The accents are however different in the two. In one case the <i>udatta</i> is on the middle; in the other, on the last.
