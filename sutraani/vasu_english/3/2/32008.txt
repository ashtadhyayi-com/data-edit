The phrase <i>anupasarga</i> is to be read again into this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> 3, though this <i>anuvritti</i> had temporarily lain dormant in <i>sutra</i> 6 and 7. as being unnecessary. This debars क; of this affix ट् and क are indicatory the ट् showing among others that the feminine is formed by the affix ङीप् [[4.1.14]]

As, शक्रं गायति = शक्र + गा + टक् =शक्रगः [[6.4.64]] 'who sings <i>Sakra</i> hymns'. सामगः 'singer of <i>Sama</i>'. fem. शक्रगी and सामगी ।

Vart:- The affix टक् comes after the verb पा when it means to drink and only when it is in composition with the words सुरा and शीधु as its object. This is an important modification of the general <i>sutra</i>. Thus सुरापः fem. सुरापी 'wine-bibber'; शीधुपः fem. शीधुपी 'spirit-drinker'.

Why do we say 'when in composition with <i>sura</i> and <i>sidhu</i>'? Observe क्षीरपा ब्राह्मणी 'the milk-drinking <i>Brahmani</i>'; formed by the affix क and the feminine, therefore, not formed by the affix ई but by आ.

Why do we say 'when पा means to drink'? When पा means 'to protect' this affix is not used; as सुरापा 'who protects wine'.

When these words are compounded with an <i>upasarga</i> they do not take टक् but अण्; as शक्रसङ्गायः, सामसङ्गायः ।

Vart:- There is diversity in the <i>Chhandas</i> as to the employment of these affixes; as या ब्राह्मणी सुरापी or सुरापा भवति नैनां देवाः पतिलोकं नयन्ति 'the gods do not carry that <i>Brahmani</i> to the regions of her husband who drinks wine'.
