The word फलेग्रहिः is formed by adding the affix इन् to the verb ग्रह and making the <i>upapada</i> end in the vowel ए. Thus फलानि गृह्णाति = फलेग्रहिः 'the fruit-bearing i. e. a tree'.

The word आत्मम्भरिः is formed by adding the augment मुम् (म) to the <i>upapada</i> आत्म, and the affix इन् to the verb भृञ्. Thus आत्मानं बिभर्ति = आत्मम्भरिः 'selfish' (one who feeds his own self).

The word 'and' indicates that there are other such irregularly-formed words. As कुक्षिम्भरिः 'gluttonous, selfish' (caring to feed his own belly). उदम्भरिः 'gluttonous, selfish'.
