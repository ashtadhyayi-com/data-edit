The word 'and' denotes that the affix खच् is also to be included.

Thus क्षेमकारः or क्षेमकरः 'propitious'; प्रियकारः or प्रियङ्करः 'showing kindness'; मद्रकारः or मद्रङ्करः 'causing delight'. 

The repetition of the affix अण्, when its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been read into this <i>sutra</i> by using the word वा 'optionally', indicates that these words never take the affix ट of <i>sutra</i> 20 though cause, habit, &c., may be denoted; so that the feminine of those words is formed by आ and not by ई; as अल्पारम्भाः क्षेमकराः 'small beginnings lead to or cause prosperity'.
