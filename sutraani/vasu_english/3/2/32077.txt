Why has this aphorism been made, when by rule (III. I. 4), स्था would have taken क and by rule [[3.1.75]], it would have taken क्विप् also? This repetition is for the purpose of prohibiting the prohibition, that is to say, the <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.14]] prohibited the <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.4]], and the present <i>sutra</i> removes that prohibition. Thus शंस्थः and शंस्थाः । But for this <i>sutra</i>, this form could not have been evolved; for, with the <i>upapada</i> शम्, the verb स्था would have taken the affix अच् by [[3.2.14]].
