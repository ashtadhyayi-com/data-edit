The word आभीक्ष्ण्य means continued repetition, that is to say, zealous practice or assiduous performance of anything, but does not mean habit. As कषायपायिणो गान्धाराः 'the people of <i>Gandhara</i> are <i>kashaya</i>-drinkers'. कषाय + पा + णिनि = कषाय + पा + युक् + णिनि [[7.3.33]]. So also क्षीरपायिण उशीनाराः 'the people of <i>Usinara</i> are milk-drinkers'. सौवीर-पायिणो बाह्लीकाः 'the people of <i>Bahlika</i> are <i>sauvira</i>-drinkers'.
 
By using the word 'diversely' in the <i>sutra</i>, this affix is not applied in other places, as in the following :- कुल्माषखादः 'a grain eater'.
