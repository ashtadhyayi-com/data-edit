The word '<i>supi</i>' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. As दर्शनीयमानी 'who thinks himself handsome'; शोभनम्मानी 'who thinks himself beautiful'.

The verb मन् belonging to the 4th conjugation is taken here and not that belonging to the 8th conjugation; because the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'diversely' is understood here. In the present aphorism, whether we take the <i>Divadi</i> or <i>Tanadi</i> मन् the resulting form would be the same, namely मानिन्. But not so in the next aphorism, where before the affix खश् there would be difference of form owing to the <i>vikarana</i> i. e., in the 4th conjugation श्यन् would be added, but not so if the verb belonged to the 8th class.
