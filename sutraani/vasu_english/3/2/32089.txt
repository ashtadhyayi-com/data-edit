The phrase 'in the accusative case' is understood in this aphorism, and applies to all the above-mentioned words, except सु, which being an attributive word, of course, cannot take any case-terminations. As सुकृत् [[6.1.71]] 'who has done well'; कर्मकृत् 'who has done all works'; पापकृत् 'who has committed sins'; मन्त्रकृत् 'who has made a mantra'; पुण्यकृत् 'who has done virtuous actions'.

This <i>sutra</i> also ordains a restrictive rule or <i>niyama</i>. Three-fold restriction is intended here: namely, restrictions with regard to time, <i>upapada</i>, and affix; but not with regard to verbs. See [[3.2.87]]. There being no restriction with regard to the root, this affix is employed when words other than these are <i>upapadas</i>. As, शास्त्रकृत् 'who has made Scriptures'; भाष्यकृत् 'who has made a commentary'. The त् is added to the root by [[6.1.71]].
