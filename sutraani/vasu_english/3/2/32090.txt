As, सोमसुत् 'who has pressed the <i>soma</i> juice, or <i>soma</i>-distiller'; 1st. dual सोमसुतौ; 1st. plural सोमसुतः ।

This <i>sutra</i> is also for the sake of making a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule. The four-fold restriction is here intended. i. e. as regards the verb, the tense, the <i>upapada</i> and the affix.
