The repetition of the word कर्मणि in the <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> might have been drawn from the last aphorism, indicates that when the object carries with it a sense of censure on the agent, then only this affix is employed and not with every and any object. As सोमविक्रयिन् 'the seller of <i>soma</i> plant'; रसविक्रयिन् 'the seller of liquors'; employing disapproval of the action of those persons who carry on these mean professions. But not so in धान्यविक्रायः 'the seller of paddy'.
