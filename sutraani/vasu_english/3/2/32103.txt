The affix ङ्वनिप् comes after the verbs सु 'to press out or extract juice' and यज् 'to sacrifice', with a past signification.
As सु + ङ्वनिप् = सुत् + वन् (VI. I 71) = सुत्वन् 1st. sing. सुत्वा 'who has pressed out or extracted juice'; यज्वन्, 1st. sing. यज्वा 'who has sacrificed'. The त् is added by [[6.1.71]]. See <i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. [[1.3.1]].
