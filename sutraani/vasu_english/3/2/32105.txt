In the छन्दस् (Vedas), the affix लिट् (Perfect Tense) comes after a verb with a past signification.
As अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श 'I saw the sun from both sides'; अहं द्यावापृथिवी आततान 'I stretched the heaven and the earth'. Here the words ददर्श and आततान have the force of <i>nishtha</i>. See <i>Yaj</i>. <i>Ved</i>. (VIII. 9).

Why this separate <i>sutra</i>, when by aphorism [[3.4.61]], in the <i>Chhandas</i> the <i>lun</i>, <i>lan</i> and <i>lit</i> come in all tenses ? That rule is made with regards to two or more verbs when in syntactical relation (धातुसम्बन्ध) with each other [[3.4.1]]. The present rule is general, and without any such limitations.

<i>Lit</i> is the affix of the Present Perfect and will be fully treated of in the conjugation of verbs.
