This prohibits लृट् which the verb वस् obtained from the last <i>sutra</i>. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत् कश्मीरेष्ववसाम 'thou rememberest <i>Devadatta</i> how we did dwell in <i>Kashmir</i>'. Here the mere fact of dwelling is recollected, there being no other idea implied; therefore the subsequent aphorism has no scope here. That aphorism has its scope, when with recollection, is added another dependent idea or action, without which the sentence is not complete.
