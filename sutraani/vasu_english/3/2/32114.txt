The word साकाङ्क्षा means the relation between the sign and the thing signified, wished for or wanted by the speaker, or in other words, when the first verb is related to another verb used in the same sentence, as a sign is to that which is indicated by the sign. As अभिजानासि देवदत्तः कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः, तत्र सक्तून् पास्यामः or अभिजानासि देवदत्तः कश्मीरान् गच्छामः, तत्र सक्तून् पिबामः 'do you remember <i>Devadatta</i> we went to Kashmir and there did drink <i>Saktu</i>'.

This option is allowed whether the particle यत् is or is not used. As अभिजानासि देवदत्तः यत् कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः (or यत् कश्मीरान् गच्छाम,) यत् तत्रौदनं भोक्ष्यामहे (or यत् तत्रौदनमभुञ्ज्महि) 'Do you recollect, <i>Devadatta</i> how we went to <i>Kashmir</i> and how we ate rice there'.

In the above examples, the verb 'to go' is the sign, and the 'eating' or 'drinking', in the second sentence, is the thing really signified; the first verb is necessary as an introduction to the thought of the speaker which dwells more upon the second verb. Here the second sentence or proposition is used as completion or complement of the first proposition.
