As पवमानः 'purifier (fire or air)'; यजमानः 'sacrificer'.

It might be asked 'is the शानन् with others that follow, an affix suo generis, or is it merely a substitute of ल, as शतृ and शानच् ? Why we ask this question is this. If they are affixes and not substitutes of ल, then they should govern genitive case by rule (II. 3. 65.) instead of nominative or the accusative. If, on the other hand, they are substitutes of ल, then by rule (II. 3. 69.) they should not govern the genitive case. But evidently they are not the substitutes of ल, as they are not so taught. How is it then that we have such forms as सोमं पवमानः 'drinking <i>Soma</i>'; and नडमाघ्नानः? These forms can be explained on other grounds than supposing that शानन् &c. must be the substitutes of ल. The term तृन् in <i>sutra</i> (II 3. 69.) is not the affix तृन् taught in this Chapter <i>sutra</i> 135; but it is a <i>pratyahara</i> including several affixes. It is a <i>pratyahara</i> formed by taking the तृ of शतृ in <i>sutra</i> 124; and न् of तृन् in 135; and thus it means all the affixes from शतृ in 134 down to तृन् in 135. Thus though शानन्, चानश् &c. are not substitutes of ल, still the rule (II. 3. 69.) applies to them, as they are included in the term तृन्.

Vart:- The rule (II. 3. 69.) applies only optionally when the verb द्विष् takes the affix शतृ. As चोरस्य or चोरं द्विषन् 'hating the thief'.
