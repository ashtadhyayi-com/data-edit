The word अकृच्छ्र means that which is accomplished by the agent with ease and facility. As अधीयन् पारायणम् 'the facile reading of the <i>Purana</i>'; धारयन्नुपनिषदम् 'easily mastering the <i>Upanishad</i>'. The root धारि is causative of धृ and means here 'to master'.
 
Why do we say 'when facility is indicated'? Otherwise कृच्छ्रेणाधीते 'he reads with difficulty'; कृच्छ्रेण धारयति 'he remembers with difficulty'.
