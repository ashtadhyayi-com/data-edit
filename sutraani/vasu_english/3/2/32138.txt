Thus भविष्णुः 'becoming'.

The <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> or the division of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, with which it could well have been read, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>.

The word 'also' indicates the existence of other verbs not included in the above two <i>sutras</i>; as, भ्राजिष्णुना लोहितचन्दनेन ।
