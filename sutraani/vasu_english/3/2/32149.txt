The affix युच् comes, in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit etc.' after intransitive verbs as are आत्मनेपदि and begin with a consonant and are अनुदात्त i.e. have a gravely accented vowel as as indicatory.
As वर्त्तनः 'being'; वर्द्धनः 'growing'.

Why do we say '<i>Anudattet</i>'? Observe भविता.

Why do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe एधिता, which though <i>Atmanepadi</i>, takes तृन्.

Why have we used the term आदि 'beginning' in the <i>sutra</i>? Observe जुगुप्सनः 'censuring'; मीमांसनः 'an investigator'. For without the word आदि, the rule would have stood thus:- अनुदात्तेतश्च हलः which by (I. I. 72.) would mean 'the affix युच् comes after the verbs which end with a consonant'; so that even after एध् we shall have युच्; and there would be no युच् after जुगुप्स which ends with a vowel.

This rule will not apply if the root is transitive; as वसिता वस्त्रं ।
