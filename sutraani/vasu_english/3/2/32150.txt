The affix युच् comes after the following verbs in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit etc.' - 1. जु 2. चङ्क्रम्य 3. दन्द्रम्य 4. सृ 5. गृध 6.ज्वल 7. शुच 8. लष 9. पत 10. पद।
The verb जु is not to be found in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, and is taught in the aphorisms and is hence called a <i>sautra</i> <i>dhatu</i>. It means 'to go', 'to be quick'. As जु + युच् = जो +अन (VII. 1. 1.) and [[7.3.84]] = जवनः (VI. I. 78), [[2.3.46]] 'a courser, a swift horse'. चङ्क्रम्य + युच् = चङ्क्रम् + अन् [[2.4.74]] = चङ्क्रमनः 'moving about'; so also दन्द्रमणः 'wandering'; सरणः 'flowing'; गर्द्धनः 'greedy'; ज्वलनः 'burning'; शोचनः 'grieving'; लषणः 'desiring'; पतनः 'falling'; पदनः 'moving'.

The enumeration of the word पद in the above, indicates that this <i>sutra</i> applies to the transitive verbs; otherwise the <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.148]] would have been sufficient, as पद is a चलनार्थ verb. Others say that the inclusion of पद् in this aphorism indicates the existence of the <i>paribhasha</i> already given under <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.146]] i.e. the rule of [[3.1.94]] has no concern with affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'. The affix इष्णुच् which by [[3.2.136]] is added to अलङ्कृतम्, supersedes therefore not merely the addition of तृन् to अलङ्कृतम् [[3.2.135]], but also the addition of ण्वुल् to the same. If a <i>tachchhilika</i> <i>apavada</i> were to supersede only an <i>atachchhilika</i> <i>utsarga</i>, it would have been superfluous for <i>Panini</i> to teach in this <i>sutra</i> the addition of युच् to पद्, because in that case the addition of युच् to पद् by [[3.2.154]] would not have debarred the addition of युच् to पद् by [[3.2.149]]. The repetition is for the sake of <i>jnapana</i>, therefore, and it indicates the existence of the above-mentioned maxim. The <i>jnapaka</i> is not, however, of universal application; for sometimes both affixes are applied concurrently; as, गन्ता खेटं विकत्थनः ।
