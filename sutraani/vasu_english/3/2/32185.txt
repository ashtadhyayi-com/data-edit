The verb पू includes two verbs पूङ् and पूञ् both meaning 'to purify', but belonging to two different conjugations; as पवित्रं an instrument for cleansing or purifying, such as a sieve or a strainer; and in this sense it means 'two blades of <i>Kusa</i> grass used at sacrifices in purifying and sprinkling <i>ghee</i>'. It also means 'the sacred thread, the clarified butter, &c'.
