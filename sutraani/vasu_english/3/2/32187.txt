The <i>Nishtha</i> affix क्त, as a general rule, is a past participial affix and denotes past time; and is so ordained by rule (III 2.102). The present <i>sutra</i> thus makes an exception in case of those verbs which are marked with an indicatory ञि in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>; as ञिमिदा 'to be affectionately inclined'; मिन्नः (मिद् + क्त = मिङ् + त = मिन् + न [[8.2.42]] 'being affectionately inclined'. So ञिक्षिवदा — क्ष्विणः 'sounding inarticulately'; ञिधृषा — धृष्टः 'bold'. The <i>anuvritti</i> of वर्तमाने 'in the sense of the present', is read into this <i>sutra</i> from [[3.2.123]].
