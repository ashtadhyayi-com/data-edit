All the conditions of the last <i>sutra</i> apply here also, namely 'when the action denoted by the verb is related to another action denoted by another verb in the imperative, as a sign is to the thing indicated'. By force of the word च we read the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>lat</i> also into this aphorism. The word ऊर्ध्वमौहूर्त्तिक is a secondary derivative from ऊर्ध्वमुहूर्त्त, meaning 'that which exists in time above a <i>muhurta</i>'. This is an irregular compound; and the <i>vriddhi</i> takes place irregularly of the उ of मु and not of ऊ as the general rule required. The whole word thus formed qualifies the word 'future'. Thus ऊर्ध्वं मुहूर्त्तादुपरि मुहूर्तस्य उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छेत् (आगच्छति, आगमिष्यति or आगन्ता), अथ त्वं छन्दोऽधीष्व 'If the teacher comes after an hour (of 48 minutes), you had better read the Prosody'.
