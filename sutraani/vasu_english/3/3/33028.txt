The affix घञ् comes after the roots 1. पू 'to purify' 2. लू 'to cut' when निर् and अभि are respectively in composition.
The word पू refers to both पूङ् and पूञ्. The rule (I. 3. 10.) must be applied here, and thus निर् comes before पू, and अभि before लू । As निष्पावः 'winnowing'; अभिलावः 'moving'. But पवः and लवः, without these prepositions.
