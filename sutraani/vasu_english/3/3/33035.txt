This debars the affix अप्. As उद्ग्राहः 'lifting up'.

Vart:- In the Vedas this affix is applied even when the word  ग्रह is preceded by नि; and the ह is changed into भ; the sense of the two words being 'to lift up' and 'throw down' respectively of the sacrificial ladle; as, उद्ग्राभं च निग्राभं च ब्रह्मदेवा अवीवृधन् ।
