The words within brackets are to be supplied from <i>sutras</i> 18 and 19: and these words are to be supplied in every subsequent <i>sutra</i> as far as <i>sutra</i> 113 of this chapter. This debars घञ्. The च in अच् is qualitative, in <i>sutras</i> like [[6.2.144]].

Thus, चयः 'collecting'; अयः 'going'; जयः 'victory'; क्षयः 'wasting'.

Vart:- In this connection the words भय &c. should also be enumerated. As भी + अच् = भयम् 'fear'; वर्षम् 'rain'. These being neuter words, otherwise would have taken the affix क्त &c. but for this <i>Vartika</i>.

Vart:- The words जव and सव are formed by this affix, and occur in the Vedas. As ऊर्वोरस्तु मे जयः, पञ्चोदनसवः । These roots जु and सु would have otherwise taken the affix अप्. The form would have been the same, but there would be difference of accent. See <i>Rig</i>. I. 112. 21, and <i>Yaj</i>. XI. 2.
