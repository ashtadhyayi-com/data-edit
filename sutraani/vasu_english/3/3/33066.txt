The word नित्यं 'invariably' is used in the aphorism in order to stop the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word optionally. Thus मूलकपणः 'a handful of radishes'; शाकपणः 'a handful of vegetable'. These words secondarily have come to mean 'a measure equal to a handful', irrespective of any thing.

When not meaning measure, we have पणः 'trade'.
