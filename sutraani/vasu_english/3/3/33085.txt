It is formed by adding अप् [[3.3.76]] to the verb हन् preceded by the <i>upasarga</i> उप, then eliding the penultimate अ of ह; this is the irregularity. Then by <i>sandhi</i> rules हन् is changed into घ्नः । This form would have been given by the affix क also, without any irregularity.

The word आश्रय refers to 'proximity, contiguity'. Thus पर्वतोघ्नः 'the declivity of the mountain'; so also ग्रामोपघ्नः 'bordering the village'.

Why do we say 'when meaning support'? Observe पर्वतोपघातः ।
