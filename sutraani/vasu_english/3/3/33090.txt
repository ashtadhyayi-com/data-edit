The conditions of <i>sutras</i> 18 and 19 are understood here also. The ङ् of नङ् is for the sake of prohibiting <i>guna</i> or <i>vriddhi</i> (I. I. 5); as यज्ञः 'sacrifice'; याच्ञा 'solicitation'; यत्नः 'effort'; विश्नः [[6.4.19]] 'lustre'; प्रश्नः 'a question'; रक्ष्णः 'protection.

 The root प्रच्छ, by [[6.1.16]], ought to have changed its र into ॠ before the ङित् affix नङ्. Its not doing so must be taken to be an irregularity countenanced by <i>Panini</i>, as we know from the fact that <i>Panini</i> himself uses the form प्रश्नः in (III. 2. II7).
