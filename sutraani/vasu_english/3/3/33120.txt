This supersedes घ । The ञ् is indicatory and causes the <i>vriddhi</i> of ॠ [[7.2.115]] and is also for the sake of regulating the accent [[6.1.195]], [[6.1.197]]. The indicatory घ् is useful in the subsequent aphorism where it changes the palatals into gutturals. Thus अवतारः 'the descent (or incarnation of a diety); अवस्तारः 'a screen round a tent'.

How do we apply अवतार also in phrases like अवतारो नद्याः 'the descent of rivers', for here the word <i>avatara</i> is not an appellative? This use is also allowed, because the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word प्राय is understood here also; so that those words <i>avatara</i> &c. may be employed in senses other than appellative.
