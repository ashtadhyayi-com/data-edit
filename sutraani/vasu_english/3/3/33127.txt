The affix खल् comes after the verbs भू 'to be' and कृ when the उपपद-s in composition with them are 'agent' and 'object' respectively, preceded by the words ईषद् etc. in combination with them, meaning 'hard or light'.
Thus ईषदाढ्यं भवं 'being enriched easily'; दुराढ्यं भवम् 'to be enriched with difficulty'; स्वाढ्यङ्करो देवदत्तो भवता '<i>Devadatta</i> can be made rich by you easily'.

Vart:- It should be stated that the agent and object in composition should be, as if they ended in the affix च्वि [[5.4.50]]. Compare [[3.2.56]] and (III. 2. 57.) &c. Therefore we do not have it here स्वाढ्येन भूयते or आढ्येन सुभूयते ॥
