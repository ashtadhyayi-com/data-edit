All the words within brackets must be supplied from the previous <i>sutras</i> to complete the sense. This <i>sutra</i> consists of three words वा 'optionally', आ 'as far as' and उताप्योः (the <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.152]]). The words वा + आ + उ form वो by the rules of conjunction. The particle आ in this aphorism has the force of limit exclusive and not that of limit inclusive. The optional use of the conditional tense will be illustrated in the following aphorisms, where, in addition to the special tenses to be employed by those rules, we may employ the conditional also under those very circumstances, in the alternative, provided that the non-completion of the action is understood. Prof. Bohtlingk translates this aphorism thus: "optionally so, in connection with उत् and अपि, the conditional tense may be employed".
