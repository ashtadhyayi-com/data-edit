The word 'capability' qualifies the root so that the sense of capability must be inherent in the root; Thus भवता खलु भारो वोढव्यः, वहनीयः, वाह्यः (<i>kritya</i>), or भवान् खलु भारं वहेत् 'you can carry the load'.

Though <i>kritya</i>-affixes would have come in this sense, even without any special rule, for they are general affixes, their special mention in this <i>sutra</i> is to guard against their being superseded by लिङ्, for rule [[3.1.94]] is not universally valid.
