Thus ओदनं भुङ्क्ष्व, सक्तून्पिब, धानाः खादेत्येवायमभ्यवहरति 'he takes his meals, eating rice, drinking <i>saktu</i>, and tasting fried corn'. Here the verb अभ्यवहरति has a sense common to all the verbs in the Imperative mood. The object of taking the second verb, having the senses common to all the antecedent verbs, is to prevent the repetition of all the previous ones. In the secular vernacular, the brevity, however, is often not approved.
