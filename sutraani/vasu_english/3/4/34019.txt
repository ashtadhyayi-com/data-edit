Thus अपमित्य याचते 'having offered an exchange, he asks' अप + मे + क्त्वा = अप + मा + ल्यप् = अप + मि + तुक् + य [[6.1.45]] and [[6.1.71]] = अप + मित्य [[7.4.40]]. This is an optional rule, as the phrase 'according to the northern' indicates. So we have in the alternative, याचित्वाऽपयमते 'having asked he exchanges'; and this is the more general use of <i>ktva</i>; namely, it comes after that verb which is concerned about a time anterior to that of the other; see rule 21. The present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[3.4.21]].

The root मेङ् has been exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> as माङ्, with the vowel आ instead of ए. This indicates the existence of the following <i>Paribhasha</i>:--

"A root, which, when destitute of <i>anubandhas</i>, ends in either ए, ओ or ऐ, must not be considered to have ceased to end in either ए, ओ, or ऐ, when an <i>anubandha</i> has been attached to it." By this <i>Paribhasha</i> दैप् must be regarded as ending in ऐ, and as therefore आ may be substituted for the vowel ऐ [[6.1.45]], even while प् remains, दैप् does assume the form दाप् and is consequently; by the prohibition अदाप् in <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.20]], forbidden to be termed घु ।
