Of the affix  खमुञ्, the efficient portion is अम्; the indicatory ख introduces the augment मुम् [[6.3.67]]. Thus चोरं कारमाक्रोशति 'he reviles him as thief, i. e. he calls out in abuse 'thou art a thief., thou art a robber, &c.' The person is not really made a thief, but making him a thief is to express one's indignation.
