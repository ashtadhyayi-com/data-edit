The word परीप्सा means 'haste, hurry'. Thus शय्योत्थायं (or शय्याया उत्थायं) धावति 'having risen from bed, he runs away'. That is to say, he runs with such a haste that he does not perform even the necessary ablutions &c, but as soon as he rises from the bed, he runs off. Similarly रन्ध्रापकर्षम् पयः पिबति 'he drinks milk from a hole in the vessel', he being in such a haste, that he does not care to drink from the proper aperture. भ्राष्ट्रापकर्षमपूपान् भक्षयति 'he eats cakes hot from the frying pan', not waiting till they are placed on a dish.

Why do we say 'when meaning hurry'? Observe, आसनादुत्थाय गच्छति 'having risen from the seat, he goes'. Here 'haste' not being intended, the affix क्त्वा (ल्यप्) is employed. See [[2.2.21]].
