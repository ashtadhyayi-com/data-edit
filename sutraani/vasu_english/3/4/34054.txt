Thus ध्रुविक्षेपं कथयति 'he narrates, throwing his eye-brows (glances) about in all directions'. अक्षिनिकाणम् जल्पति 'he prattles, having closed the eyes'.

The स्वाङ्ग word is "a word denoting a thing which not being liquid or gaseous, and being capable of being perceived by the senses, and not being one produced by a change from the natural state, exists in a living being, or though found elsewhere actually or at any particular time, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually, (not figuratively) the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being."

The word अध्रुव means 'non-vital organ', or a limb which even being cut off, does not necessarily destroy life. Therefore, we cannot use the affix णमुल् in the following, as head is not an अध्रुव limb:- उत्क्षिप्य शिरः कथयति 'he narrates, having thrown the head on one side'. Compare [[6.2.177]].
