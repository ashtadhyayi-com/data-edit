The word दाश comes from the root दाशृ 'to give' by adding  affix अच् under rule [[3.1.134]]. This being a कृदन्त word would have otherwise denoted the agent by rule [[3.4.67]] of this chapter. The present <i>sutra</i> makes it denote the recipient or have the force of the dative case. Thus दाश means 'to whom something is given i. e. a servant'. Similarly <i>goghna</i> does not mean 'the killer of cow' but 'he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest'. It is this irregularly-formed word <i>goghna</i> which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law &c, and not the regularly-formed word <i>goghna</i> which means 'a killer of cow' or a '<i>Chandal</i>'. Thus दाशः = दाशन्ति तस्मै; गोघ्नः = तस्मै दातुं गां घ्नन्ति ॥
