This is an अतिदेश <i>sutra</i>; as in the लङ् there are the affixes ताम्, तम्, त, व and म, so also in the लोट् । Thus पचताम्, पचतम्, पचत, पचाव, पचाम ।

Q -- If लोट् is like लङ्, why have we not the augment अट्, आट्, or the substitution of जुस् or झि (see [[3.4.111]]) in the case of लोट् also ?

A. -- The वा of <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.83]] is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also, so that the analogy between लोट् and लङ् is a limited analogy and does not make all the rules which are applicable to लङ्, equally applicable to लोट् also.
