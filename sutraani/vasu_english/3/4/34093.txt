This relates to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affix. Thus करवै, करवावहै, करवामहै ।

But the ए resulting from <i>sandhi</i>, is not to be changed into ऐ । Thus पचाव + इदम् = पचावेदम्, पचाम + इदम् = पचामेदम् । Here, no doubt, the ए belongs to the Imperative by [[6.1.85]], being the substitute of अ of म and व. But this is not to be changed into ऐ on the maxim that this ए is the result of a बहिरङ्ग rule, for the rule of <i>sandhi</i> [[6.1.87]], is a बहिरङ्ग rule, while the present <i>sutra</i> is an अन्तरङ्ग rule; because of the following <i>Paribhasha</i>, असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे 'that which is <i>Bahiranga</i> is regarded as not having taken effect, when an <i>Antaranga</i> rule is to be applied.
