The सिच् is elided by rule [[2.4.77]]. Thus अदुः, अधुः, अस्थुः । In other words, in those cases, where सिच् is elided by rules [[2.4.77]], [[2.4.78]] and [[2.4.79]], only जुस् is the substitute of झि where the verbs end in long आ । In other words, this <i>sutra</i> restricts the scope of the last <i>sutra</i>, by which after every सिच्, जुस् was to replace झि ।

The Present <i>sutra</i> says that after verbs in which सिच् has been elided, जुस् does not replace झि in the case of any other verb than that which ends in long आ; it is thus a <i>niyama</i> rule.

Thus, by rule [[2.4.77]], सिच् is elided after the verb भू, but as भू does not end in long आ, its 3rd person plural Aorist will not be in जुस् । Thus, अनुभवन् । Here, by the last rule, and on the maxim that 'though सिच् is elided, yet its force remains [[1.1.62]]', जुस् would have replaced झि; but the present <i>sutra</i> prohibits that. But where the सिच् is not elided, there, of course, जुस् does come. Thus अकार्षुः, अहार्षुः ।
