The remainder i.e. the affixes other than तिङ् (Personal Endings) and those with an indicatory श् sub-joined to a verbal root are called आर्द्धधातुक।
Thus the affixes तृ, तुम्, तव्यम् &c. are आर्धधातुक affixes as in the following words- लविता, लवितुम्, लवितव्यम् । Here the augment इट् is added, because of these affixes being called <i>ardhadhatuka</i> by [[7.2.35]].

The word धातोः whose <i>anuvritti</i> began with <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.91]], is understood here also. So that the affixes in relation to the verbal roots get the name of <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardhadhatuka</i>; the affixes applied to nouns do not get these names. Thus the case-affix भ्याम् when added to the noun लू, is not called an <i>arthadhatuka</i> affix, and therefore we have लूभ्याम्, लूभिः &c. Had these affixes been <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, they would have caused the <i>guna</i> of the base [[7.3.84]]. Similarly the affixes त्वं and ता in the words वृक्षत्वं and वृक्षता are not <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes. Had they been so, there would have been the insertion of the augment इट् [[7.2.35]].

Similarly in <i>sutra</i> (III. I. 5), the affix सन् is used without changing the sense, after the roots गुप्, तिज् and कित् । But as this affix is added without the enunciation of the word धातोः as it is in <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.7]], this सन् is not called <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, and does not take the augment इट्, as जुगुप्सते ।
