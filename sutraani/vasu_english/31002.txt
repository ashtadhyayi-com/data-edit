And subsequent.
This is also an '<i>adhikara</i>' or regulating sutra, and is understood in all subsequent aphorisms; or it might also be called a '<i>paribhasha</i>' or interpreting aphorism. That which is called an affix comes after, or is placed after, the '<i>dhatu</i>' or root, or the '<i>pratipadika</i>' or crude form; as कर्त्तव्यम् and तैत्तिरीयम्.

The force of the word च 'and' in this <i>sutra</i> is to indicate that the affixes here treated of, are to be placed after a root &c.; not so, however the affixes, may sometimes, be placed in the beginning or the middle of a word.
