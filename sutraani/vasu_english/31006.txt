The affix सन् comes after the verbs मान 'to honour', बध् 'to bind', दान् 'to cut', and शान् 'to whet', and long ई is the substitute of इ -- सन्यतः [[7.4.79]] of the re-duplicate -- पूर्वोऽभ्यासः [[6.1.4]] syllable.
The सन् is to be added only then, when the sense of the desiderative verb is as below: मीमांसते 'he investigates', बीभस्सते 'he loathes', दीदांसते 'he  straightens', शीशांसते 'he sharpens'. The verbs given in this and the preceding <i>sutra</i>, are Desiderative in form, but not in meaning. The word 'optionally' in the next <i>sutra</i>, may be read into this also, whereby the addition of सन् becomes optional. Thus मानयति, बाधयति, दानयति and निशानयति are also valid forms.
