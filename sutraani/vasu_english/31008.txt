The affix क्यच् is optionally employed, in the sense of wishing after a word ending in a case-affix expressing the object wished as connected with the wisher itself.
This forms the Denominative verbs, i.e., verbs derived from nominal bases. As, पुत्र 'son', पुत्रीयति 'he wishes for a son of his own' (पुत्र + क्यच् = पुत्री + य = पुत्रीय) [[2.4.71]], [[7.4.33]].

Why do we use the word सुप् ? The affix should not come after a whole sentence, but only after the particular word ending in the case-affix. Thus in महान्तं पुत्रमिच्छति, the affix comes only after पुत्रम् and not महान्तं पुत्रं.

Why do we say <i>atmanah</i> ? Observe राज्ञः पुत्रमिच्छति 'he wishes a son for the king'. Here there is no affixing as the wishing is for another and not for one's own self.

The क in क्यच् is for the sake of classing <i>kyach</i>, <i>kyan</i> and <i>kyash</i> in one common group by simply using the word क्य, as in <i>sutra</i> तः क्ये [[1.4.15]]; while च् distinguishes <i>kyach</i> from <i>kyan</i> &c., and is not for the sake of accent, the affix will be <i>udatta</i> by [[3.1.3]].

Vart:- In affixing <i>kyach</i>, prohibition must be stated of pronouns in म् and of Indeclinables. Thus in इदमिच्छति, उच्चैरिच्छति, there is no affixing.

Vart:- In the Vedas, the affix is added even when the wish is with regard to another. As मा त्वा वृका अघायवो विदन्. Here अघायु (pl. अघायवः) is formed by <i>kyach</i>, अ being added by [[3.2.170]], and आ is added by [[7.4.37]]. See Rig Veda (I.120.7.27.3) &c.
