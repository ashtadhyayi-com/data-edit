And the affix काम्यच् is also used in the sense of 'wishing' after a word ending in a case-affix, expressing the object wished as connected with the wisher's self.
Thus, पुत्रकाम्यति 'he wishes for a son of his own'.

The making of this a separate <i>sutra</i> instead of adding it with the last aphorism and making one <i>sutra</i> of them both, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, where the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>kyach</i> only runs, and not that of <i>kamyach</i>. The क of <i>kamyach</i> is not indicatory, but is a part of the real affix. Here, therefore, rule [[1.3.8]] which would have made the letter क indicatory, does not apply; because no particular purpose would be served by making indicatory. Or the affix <i>kamyach</i> may be considered to have an indicatory च before it i.e. the affix being <i>chakamya</i>.
