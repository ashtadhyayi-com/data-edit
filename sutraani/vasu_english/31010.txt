The affix क्यच् is optionally employed, in the sense of treatment after a word ending in a case-affix denoting the object of comparison.
Thus, पुत्रमिवाचरति छात्रं = पुत्रीयति छात्रम् 'he treats the pupil as a son'

Vart: So also in a locative case. As प्रासादीयति कुड्ये 'he dwells in hut as if it were a palace'. पर्यङ्कीयति मञ्चके 'in a cot he lies down as if he were on a royal bedstead; he treats a cot as a royal bedstead'.
