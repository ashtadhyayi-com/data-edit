The affix क्यङ् is used after the words रोमन्य 'ruminating' and तपस 'austerity', when they are used as the objects of the action of repeating and performing respectively.
Thus, रोमन्थं वर्तयति = रोमन्थायते गौः 'the cow ruminates'.

Vart: This is restricted to the word signifying movements of the jaws. Therefore there is no affixing here; as, कीटो रोमन्थं वर्तयति.

Vart:The <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes are used after the word तपस्; as तपश्चरति = तपस्यति, 'he performs austerity'.
