The affix णिङ् , in the sense of making, comes after these words as the object of the action, viz. पुच्छ 'tail', भाण्ड 'pot' and चीवर 'rag'.
Thus उत्पुच्छयते 'he lifts up the tail', (the sense must be that of lifting or throwing about); सम्भाण्डायते 'he collects pots in a heap'; सञ्चीवरायते भिक्षुः 'the beggar collects or wears rags'. Of the affix णिङ्, the effective portion is इ, the other letters are servile. The ङ indicates <i>Atmanepada</i> [[1.3.12]]and ण serves the purposes of the application of the rule [[6.4.51]] which applies generally to all affixes containing णि, such as णिङ्, णिच् &c.

Vart:- After the word पुच्छ् the sense of the affix is that of lifting or throwing about.

Vart:- After भाण्ड the sense of the affix is that of accumulation in a heap.

Vart:- After चीवर the sense of the affix is that of acquiring or wearing.
