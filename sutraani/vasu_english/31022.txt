The affix यङ् , in the sense of repetition of the act, comes after a root, having a single vowel and beginning with a consonant.
The phrase <i>kriya-samabhihara</i> means repetition of the act or its intensity. As पच् 'to cook', पापच्यते 'he cooks again and again'; जाज्वल्यते 'he shines with great intensity'. The root must be a simple root, and not compounded with any <i>upasarga</i>. We cannot therefore make Intensives of verbs like प्राट् 'to go', (because the root अट्, is preceded by the <i>upasarga</i> प्र); or जागृ 'to be awake,' (because it contains two vowels); or ईक्ष् 'to see' (because it begins with a vowel).

Vart:- The intensive affix यङ् comes after सुचि, सूत्रि, मूत्रि, अटि, अर्ति, अश and अर्ण, though some of these contain more than two vowels and others begin with a vowel.

As, सोसूच्यते, सोसूत्र्यते, मोमूत्र्यते, अटाट्यते, अरार्यते, अशाश्यते, and पोर्णोनूयते.

The affix is not added in these cases भृशं शोभते or भृशं रोचते, as it is against usage to make Intensive forms of these verbs on the sense of intensity, though in the sense of repetition we have रोरुच्यते and शोशुभ्यते.

In making the Intensives, the root is reduplicated and it takes the terminations of the <i>Atmanepada</i> as the root is ङित्.
