The affix वङ् invariably comes in the sense of 'crookedness' after a simple verb expressing motion.
Thus क्रम् 'to move', चङ्क्रम्यते 'he moves crookedly'. So also दन्द्रम्यते. After a verb of motion, the यङ् never expresses intensity or repetition; so if the latter sense is to be expressed, a phrase must be employed; as भृशं क्रामति 'he wanders much'. This is inferred from the word नित्य used in the <i>sutra</i> i. e. यङ् always has the sense of crookedness and no other sense after a verb of motion.
