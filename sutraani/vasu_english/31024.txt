The affix वङ् when it is intended to convey the sense of contempt (गर्हा) in respect of the sense of the root (भाव) comes always after the following roots - लुप् 'to cut off', सद् 'to sit', चर् 'to walk', जप् 'to mutter silently any sacred formula', जभ 'to gape or yawn', दह् 'to burn', दश् 'to bite' and गृ 'to swallow'.
Thus लोलुप्यते 'he cuts off badly'; सासद्यते 'he sits badly'; चञ्चूर्यते 'he walks badly'; जञ्जप्यते 'he recites badly' ; so also जञ्जभ्यते, दन्दह्यते, दन्दश्यते, निजेगिल्यते. The affix यङ्, does not come in the sense of repetition &c. after the above verbs, but only in the sense of censurable performance of the action denoted by the verbs. Separate words must be used to express the intensive or the frequentative meaning. As भृशं लुम्पति 'he cuts off much'.

Why do we say 'when contempt in regard to the sense of the root is meant'? Observe साधु जपति 'he recites well'. There is no affixing as no contempt is denoted. Why do we say 'in regard to the action denoted by the root'? When the contempt is not with regard to the sense of the root, but with regard to the action as accomplished, the affix is not employed. Thus मन्त्रं जपति वृषलः 'the <i>Sudra</i> recites the sacred <i>mantras</i>'. The word नित्य of the last aphorism is understood here also.
