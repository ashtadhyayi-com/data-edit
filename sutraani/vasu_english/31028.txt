The affix आय comes after गुपू 'to protect', धूप 'to heat', विच्छ 'to approach', पण 'to contract or praise' and पन 'to praise'.
Thus गोपायति 'he protects'; धूपायति 'he heats'; so also, विच्छायति, पणायति, and पनायति.

The verb पण् being read along with पन् 'to praise,' has here the sense of praise only; so that the affix does not come after the verb पण् when it means 'to make a contract'; as शतस्य पणते, सहस्रस्य पणते.

The verbs in आय do not take <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes, as there is no indicatory letter to show that.
