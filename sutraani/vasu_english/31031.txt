The affixes आय and those that follow it i.e. आय , ईयङ् and णिङ् are optionally added, when it is desired to express one's self with an आर्धधातुक affix.
Thus ता 3rd. sing. of the Future is an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix. It is optional to retain the <i>aya</i> of <i>gopaya</i> before this affix. So we have गोपायिता or गोप्ता 'he will protect'. So also अर्तिता or ऋतीयिता; कमिता or कामयिता.

But for this <i>sutra</i>, the affixes आय &c. would have come always even when <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes were to be applied. This makes it optional. Therefore proper <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes should be applied when we retain आय &c. and when we do not retain them. Thus the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> क्तिन् [[3.3.95]] will be employed in forming the feminine noun from the simple root, but the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> अ [[3.3.102]] will be employed in forming the feminine when आय &c. are retained. Thus गुप्तिः or गोपावा.
