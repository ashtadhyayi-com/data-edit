All the roots ending with the affixes सन् and others are called धातु ।
This extends the sphere of <i>Dhatu</i> or roots already defined in <i>sutra</i> [[1.3.1]]. These roots may be called derivative roots. They are separate independent roots, and have all the functions of a root, as taking tense-affixes &c. as shown in the above examples. Thus चिकीर्षा 'to wish to do', कारि 'to cause to do'; चेक्रिय 'to do repeatedly' are separate roots and not the same as कृ 'to do' and thus take शप् &c.
