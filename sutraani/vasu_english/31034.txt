सिप् is diversely the affix of a verbal root when लेट् follows.
The tense called लेट् or subjunctive is found in the <i>Vedas</i> only. When the subjunctive tense is employed, the affix सिप् is diversely added.

Thus जोषिषत्, तारिषत्, मन्दिषत्. Sometimes this augment is not employed; thus पताति दिद्युत् उदधिं ज्यावयाति. Thus in <i>Rig Veda</i> [[1.1.2]], वक्षति is an example of लेट् with सिप् ॥
