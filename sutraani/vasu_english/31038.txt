The affix आम् is optionally used after these - उष् 'to burn', विद् 'to know' and जागृ 'to wake', when लिट् (Perfect Tense) follows.
Thus ओषाञ्चकार or उवोष, विदाञ्चकार or विवेद, जागराञ्चकार or जजागार. As there is an agreement in the present instance to regard the verb विद as ending in a short अ, <i>guna</i> is not substituted, as it would otherwise have been by rule [[7.3.86]].
