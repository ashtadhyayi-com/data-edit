When लुङ् (Aorist) follows, the affix च्लि is added to the verbal root.
The इ of च्लि is for the sake of articulation, the च is for the sake of accent (VI.I.162.) showing that an affix which has an indicatory च has <i>udatta</i> on its final. Then remains only लि, which after all, is to be replaced by other affixes, as we shall show below. In fact च्लि is the common name for all Aorist affixes.
