After the roots धे 'to suck' and श्वि 'to grow', चङ् is optionally the substitute of च्लि , when लुङ् (Aorist) follows signifying an agent.
As, अदधत्, 'he sucked'. When it takes the alternative सिच्, then rule [[2.4.78]] comes into operation, and we have अधात् and अधासीत् 'he sucked'. So also of श्वि, we have अशिश्वियत् 'he grew'. It also takes the अङ्, [[3.1.58]] and then its form is अश्वत् or अश्वयीत्.
