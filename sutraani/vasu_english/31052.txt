After the verbs अस् 'to throw', वच् 'to speak' and ख्या 'to speak', अङ् is the substitute of च्लि , when लुङ् (Aorist) follows signifying an agent.
वच् may be either the root, or the substitute of ब्रू [[2.4.53]] and so also ख्या may be the root, or the substitute of चक्ष् [[2.4.54]]. The root अस् belonging to the दिवादि or the Fourth conjugation, falls under the subdivision पुषादि, and therefore it would have taken अङ् in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> by rule [[3.1.55]]. The repetition is to indicate that it takes अङ्, in the <i>Atamanepada</i> also; as पर्यास्थत [[7.4.17]], अवोचत् and आख्यत्. In the Passive, we have पर्यासिषाताम्.
