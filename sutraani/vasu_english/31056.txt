After the words सृ 'to go', शास् 'to order' and ऋ 'to go', अङ् is the substitute of च्लि in the परस्मैपद as well as the आत्मनेपद ।
Thus असरत् 'he went'; अशिषत् 'he ordered'; आरत् 'he went'. This <i>sutra</i> has been separately enunciated in order to make the rule applicable to <i>Atmanepada</i>; as समरन्त [[1.3.29]]. The च in the text is for the sake of drawing the <i>anuvritti</i> of the phrase 'in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>' of the last <i>sutra</i>, into the present and its <i>anuvriti</i> will extend to future <i>sutras</i> also.
