चिण् is not the substitute of च्लि after the verb तप् 'to suffer' when used reflexively and when the sense of experiencing remorse.
This prohibition applies even to the passive and impersonal voices of the verb तप्; as अतप्त तपस्तापसः 'the ascetic performed austerity'; अन्वतप्त पापेन कर्मणा 'he repented from evil deeds'.
