चिण् is the substitute of च्लि when त -3rd Person Singular आत्मनेपद follows, denoting the action (भाव) or the object कर्म्म।
A verb is said to denote an action when it is used impersonally; and it is said to denote an object when used in the Passive sense. As अशयि भवता 'it was lain by you i.e. you lay'; अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन; the mat was made by <i>Devadatta</i>'. The repetition of चिण् here is for the sake of distinctness.
