As far as the end of the Third Chapter reckoning from the present sūtra, the affixes treated of are to be understood as coming after some verbal root. (Note: This is an अधिकार सूत्र। All these verbal affixes are broadly classified as कृत् and कृत्य affixes)
This is an <i>Adhikara</i> <i>Sutra</i>. All these verbal affixes are broadly divided into two parts कृत् and कृत्य् affixes, which will be described later on.
