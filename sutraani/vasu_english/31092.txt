In the Third Chapter of Grammar, referring to verbal roots, the word implied in a term exhibited in the Locative -7th-case, is called उपपद or dependant word.
Thus in <i>sutra</i> (III.2.) कर्म्मण्यन् the word कर्म्मणि is exhibited in the 7th case; therefore the word implied by the word कर्म्मणि, namely, the word having the accusative case, will be called उपपद. Thus कुम्भम् + कृ + अण् = कुम्भकारः 'a potter'; here the word कुम्भम् is an <i>upapada</i>.
