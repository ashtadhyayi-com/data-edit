After the root भू 'to be', in construction with a case-inflected word as its उपपद and when used without a preposition, the affix क्यप् is used to denote condition - भाव।
The words सुपि and अनुपसर्गे of previous <i>sutras</i> are understood in this. The <i>anuvritti</i> of यत् does not cover this aphorism. As ब्रह्मभुवं गतः = ब्रह्मत्वं गतः 'gone to or arrived at <i>Brahma</i>hood'; देवभुवं = देवत्वं गतः 'gone to divinity'.

The word <i>bhava</i> of this <i>sutra</i> governs the succeeding ones.

Why do we say 'in construction with a case-inflected word'? Otherwise it will take यत्; as भू + यत् = भो + यत् = भव्यम् (VI.I.79).

Why do we say 'not taking a preposition'? Observe प्रभव्यम् ।
