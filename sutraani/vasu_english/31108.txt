After the root हनु 'to kill' when in construction with a case-inflected word as its उपपद and when used without a preposition comes the affix क्यप् in denoting condition and the letter त is the substitute of its final.
The phrases सुपि अनुपसर्गे and भावे are understood in this <i>sutra</i>.

As ब्रह्म + हन् + क्यप् = ब्रह्म + हत् + य = ब्रह्महत्य, [[6.1.71]] ब्रह्महत्या '<i>Brahman</i>- murder'. So also अश्वहत्या 'killing a horse'.

When not in construction with a noun, the form is घातः 'a blow' (हन् + णिच् +घञ्). This verb does not take the affix ण्यत् in denoting condition, there being no example of such formation.

Why do we say 'when not taking a preposition'? Observe प्रघातो वर्तते 'there is a combat'.
