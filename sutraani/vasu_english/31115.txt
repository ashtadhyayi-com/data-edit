The words भिद्य and उद्ध्यौ are irregularly formed by the affix क्यप् , when meaning 'river'.
Thus भिद् + क्यप् = भिद्यः 'a river that breaks its banks by the rush of its water', the name of the <i>Bhidya</i> river.

ऊज्झ् + क्यप् = उद्ध्य 'a river whose waters overflow the banks', name of the <i>Uddhya</i> river; the झ is changed into ध.

When not meaning or qualifying the river, the regular forms are used; thus भेत्ता and उज्झिता.
