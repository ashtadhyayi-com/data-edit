The words पुष्य and सिद्ध्य् are irregularly formed by the affix क्यप् , when used as names of asterisms.
Thus पुष् + क्यप् = पुष्यः 'the <i>Pushya</i> asterism'. It is so called because objects are nourished under the influences of this asterism. सिध् + क्यप् = सिद्ध्यः 'the asterism <i>Siddhya</i>' another name of <i>Pushya</i>, so-called because things are accomplished under the influence of this star.

When not the names of asterisms, the forms are पोषणं 'nourishing', सेधनम् 'accomplishing'.
