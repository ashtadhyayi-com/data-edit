When the words विपूय , विनीय and जित्या are irregularly formed they mean 'the मुञ्ज grass', 'the sediment' and 'the plough', respectively.
Thus वि + पू + क्यप् = विपूयः etymologically 'that which has to be purified to make rope'; वि + नी + क्यप् =विनीय 'a sediment or sin'; जि + क्यप् = जित्य 'a plough that which is to be conquered by strength'.

The regular derivatives are विपाव्यम्, विनेयम् and जेयम्.
