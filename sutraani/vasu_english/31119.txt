The root ग्रह 'to seize' takes the affix क्यप् when it means a 'word', a 'dependent', 'outside' or a 'partisan'.
Thus प्रगृह्यम् 'the <i>Pragrihya</i> words that do not admit of <i>sandhi</i>, already defined in <i>sutra</i> (I.I.II). So also अवगृह्यं.

The word अस्वैरि means dependent upon others, not free to provide for himself. Thus गृह्यकाः शुकाः 'the captive parrots'.

The word बाह्य means 'situated outside'. Thus ग्रामगृह्या सेना 'an army lying outside the village'. The word बाह्या being in the feminine gender indicates that the derivative word formed from ग्रह must also be feminine in gender to have this sense.

The word पक्ष्य is derived from पक्ष 'a side, a party', and means a partisan, follower or friend. Thus वासुदेवगृह्याः 'siding with or being the partisans of <i>Vasudeva</i>'. So also अर्जुनगृह्याः 'belonging to the party of <i>Arjun</i>'.
