The word युग्यम् is irregularly formed meaning 'a vehicle'.
The word पत्र means that by which a thing is carried. Thus युग्यो गौ 'the carrier bull or the yoked bull'. युग्यो हस्ती 'the harnessed elephant ready to carry'. युज् + क्यप् = युग्यम्. The ज is changed into ग. When not meaning a carrier or a carriage, it has the form योग्यं.
