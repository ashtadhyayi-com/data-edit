The words कुण्डपाय्यः and संचाय्यः are irregularly formed meaning 'a sacrifice'.
These words are thus formed: कुण्ड + पा (to drink) + यत् = कुण्ड + पा + य + य [[7.3.33]] = कुण्डपाय्यः 'the sacrifice in which <i>Soma</i> is drunk with a bowl'. The accent falls on the first syllable by [[6.1.213]]. सम् + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् = सञ्चाय्यः 'the sacrifice in which <i>Soma</i> is collected'.

If not applied to sacrifices, the forms will be कुण्डपानम् and सञ्चेयः.
