The words चित्य and ग्निचित्य are also irregularly formed.
The word चित्यः comes from the root चि 'to collect', and means fire i. e. that which is collected. As चित्योऽग्निः 'the funeral pile fire'. The word अग्निचित्या means, arranging the fire. The affix य has been added to denote condition, together with the augment तुक् (त्). These words have <i>udatta</i> accent on the last vowel. The regular form is चेयम् 'to be gathered'.
