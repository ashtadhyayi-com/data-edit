After the verbs beginning with ज्वल 'to shine' and ending with कस 'to go', when used without a preposition, the affix ण is optionally used.
The word इति in ज्वलति indicates beginning. These are about 56 verbs, all belonging to the <i>Bhvadi</i> class. See No. 804 to 860 in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, Bombay Edition in the Appendix to <i>Sidhanta Kaumudi</i>.

This debars the affix अच्; as ज्वालः or ज्वलः; चालः or चलः.

The affix ण (अ) having an indicatory ण्, causes the <i>vriddhi</i> of the penultimate अ. When the affix ण is not used, then अच् is used and we have the other form. But compound verbs take अच्; as प्रज्वलः 'luminous'.

Vart:- The verb तन 'to stretch' must be included in this list, and it takes the affix ण; as अवतान. The conditions 'option' and 'without preposition' do not apply in this case. The verb तन् necessarily takes this affix, though compounded with an <i>upasarga</i>.
