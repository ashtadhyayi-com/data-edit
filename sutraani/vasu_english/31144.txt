The affix क is used after the verb ग्रह 'to seize' when the agent so expressed denotes a house.
Thus ग्रह + क [[6.1.16]] = गृहम् 'a house'. The र is changed into ॠ by the rule of <i>samprasarana</i>. The plural form गृहाः means 'wife', as she is especially the person that constitutes the house; while the plural of गृहं meaning 'house' will be गृहाणि.
