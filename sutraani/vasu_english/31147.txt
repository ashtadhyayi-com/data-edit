The affix ण्युट् is also used after the verb गै 'to sing' when the agent so expressed denotes an artist.
By the word च 'also', the word गा of the last <i>sutra</i> is drawn into this. Thus गै + ण्युट् = गा + अन (VII.I.I) = गायनः fem. गायनी; the य is added by [[7.3.33]].

The separation of these rules (<i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> ) relating to गै is for the purpose of the <i>sutras</i> that follow. Had गस्थकन् and ण्युट् च been made one aphorism, the <i>anuvritti</i> of both these affixes would have run into the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. But it is intended that the <i>anuvritti</i> of ण्युट् should only run, and hence this <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> or division of one <i>sutra</i> into two.
