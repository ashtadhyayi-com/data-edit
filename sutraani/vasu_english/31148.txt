After the verb हा , also the affix ण्युट् is used when the agent so expressed denotes 'rice' and 'time'.
The verb हा denotes two verbs हाक 'to abandon' and हाङ् 'to go' both belonging to the Third Conjugation, forming जहाति and जिहीते as 3rd per. sing. Thus हा + ण्युट् = हायनः 'a kind of rice' (that which <i>jahati</i> 'leaves off' all water) हायनः 'a year' (that which jihite 'goes through' all conditions.)

The accents are however different in the two. In one case the <i>udatta</i> is on the middle; in the other, on the last.
