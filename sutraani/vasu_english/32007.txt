The affix क comes after root ख्या 'to tell', when preceded by the preposition सम् and when the object is in compsition with it.
The verb ख्या ends in long आ and by [[3.2.3]] when compounded with an <i>upasarga</i>, it would have taken the affix अण्. This debars अण्; as गोसङ्ख्या [[6.4.64]] 'a cowherd' (गा सञ्चष्टे).
