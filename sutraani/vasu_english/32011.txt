The affix अच् comes after the verb हृञ् (when the object is in composition with it) the root taking the preposition आञ् and the sense of the word to be formed in inclination or accustomed occupation.
The word ताच्छील्यं means a natural inclination or habitual occupation; as पुष्पाहरः (पुष्प + आहरति = पुष्प + आहर) 'he who has a natural tendency towards fetching flowers or whose habitual occupation is to collect flowers'; so also फलाहरः ।

Why do we say 'when denoting inclination'? Otherwise the affix will be अण्; as भारमाहरति = भाराहारः 'who brings load'.
