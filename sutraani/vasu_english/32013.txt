The affix अच् comes after the verb रम् 'to sport' and जप् 'to whisper' when the case-inflected words स्तम्भ 'a clump of grass' and कर्ण 'ear' are in composition with them respectively.
The verb रम् is intransitive and the verb जप् can take an object under very limited circumstances, only namely when the object denotes <i>Sabda</i> ; therefore in the case of both these verbs, the object cannot be in composition as an accusative case; therefore, the <i>upapada</i> here must be a general case-inflected word. Hence we have read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word सुप् from <i>sutra</i> 4 into this, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word कर्म्म being inapplicable here.

Vart:- The words to be formed must have the sense of 'elephant' and a 'tale-bearer'. Thus स्तम्बेरमते = स्तम्बेरमः 'an elephant (lit. who sports in cluster of grass)' कर्णे जपति = कर्णेजपः 'a slanderer (lit. who whispers in the ear)'.

The affix अच् is not employed when the words to be formed do not mean an 'elephant' and a 'traducer'. Thus स्तम्बे रन्ता 'who plays in clusters of grass'. कर्णे जपिता मशकः 'the mosquito that hums near the ear'.
