The affix अच् is used after the verbal roots when शम् 'well' is in composition and the word to be formed denotes a name.
As शम् + कृ + अच्  = शङ्करः lit. 'who does good'. So also सम्भवः संवहः । All these are proper nouns.

Why have we repeated the word <i>dhatu</i> in this aphorism, when it was understood by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[3.1.91]]? To this the reply is, that the repetition of the word <i>dhatu</i> shows that there is prohibition of the affix ट, that comes after the verb कृ in certain senses [[3.2.20]], when the word शम् is in composition. The affix अच् will be employed after the verb कृ and not the affix ट्, when शम् is an <i>upapada</i>, even when the sense to be indicated is that of cause, habit &c. [[3.2.20]]. The result is that the feminine of शङ्कर will be शङ्करा, and not शङ्करी, which, had the affix been ट, would have been the proper feminine (See [[4.1.14]]). शङ्करा means 'a female-ascetic', 'a vulture' and 'one having the habit of doing good'.
