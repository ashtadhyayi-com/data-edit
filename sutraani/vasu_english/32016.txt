The affix ट comes after the verb चर् 'to go' when a case-inflected word in composition with it denotes a location.
The word <i>adhikarana</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood in this. As कुरुषु चरति = कुरुचरः 'who goes among the <i>Kurus</i>'. मद्रचरः 'who goes among the Madras'.

Of the affix ट the real affix is अ, the letter ट being indicatory, showing that the feminine of these words is formed by the affix ङीप्. (See. [[4.1.14]]), as कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी ।
