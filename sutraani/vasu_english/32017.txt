The affix ट is used after the verb चर् 'to go' when the words in composition with it भिक्षा 'alms', सेना 'army' and आदाय 'having taken'.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words 'in the locative case' does not extend to this aphorism, and hence the necessity of making a distinct and separate <i>sutra</i>.

Thus भिक्षाचरः 'a beggar' (who goes for alms); सेनाचरः 'one who goes with an army'; आदायचरः 'one who goes after having taken'.
