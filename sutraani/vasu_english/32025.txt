When the agent indicated is an animal, the affix इन् comes after the verb हृ 'to take', the object in composition with it being the words ददृति 'a leather bag' and नाथ 'a master'.
Thus दूतिहरिः 'a dog' (a carrier of skin); नाथहरिः 'a beast' (that carries its master).

When the words formed do not denote an animal, the affix अण् is employed; as दूतिहारः 'a water-carrier' (a carrier of a leather-bag for holding water). नाथहारः 'a carrier of his master'.
