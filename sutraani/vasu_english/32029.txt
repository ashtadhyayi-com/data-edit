The affix खश् comes after the verbs ध्मा 'to blow' and धे 'to suck' when नासिका 'nose' and स्तन 'breast' are in composition with them as object.
The rule of <i>yathasankhya</i> as given in [[1.3.10]] does not however, apply here. For स्तन is compounded with धेट्; as (स्तन + धे + खश् = स्तन + मुम् + धे + शप् + खश् = स्तन + म् + धय् + अ + अ) = स्तनन्धयः 'an infant' (sucking the breast).

But नासिका is compounded with both ध्मा and धे; as नासिका + ध्मा + खश् = नासिक + म् + धम + अ [[6.3.66]] and (67); [[7.3.78]] = नासिकन्धमः 'blowing and breathing through the nose'. So also नासिकन्धयः 'drinking through the nose'.

That the rule of <i>yathasankhya</i> does not apply here, is indicated by the irregular construction of the <i>Dvandva</i> compound नासिकास्तनयोः. By rule [[2.2.84]] the word स्तन containing fewer syllables ought to have stood first; one irregularity lets in another.

The feminine of स्तनन्धयः is स्तनन्धयी, as the verb धे has an indicatory ट् ।
