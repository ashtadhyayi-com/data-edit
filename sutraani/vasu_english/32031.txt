The affix खश् comes after the verbs रुजि 'to break into pieces' and वह् 'to carry', when preceded by the उपसर्ग उत् and the word कूल 'bank' is in composition with them as the object.
Thus कूलमुद्रुजति = कूलमुद्रुजः 'breaking down banks' (such as a chariot, river, elephant, &c.); कूलमुद्वहः 'tearing up or carrying away the bank'.
