The affix खश् is used after the verb पच् 'to cook' when मित 'a measured partition' or नख 'a nail' is the word in composition with it as an object.
The aphorism has its scope when the words formed do not denote measures, which was the case in the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus मितम्पचा ब्राह्ममणी 'the <i>Brahmani</i> who cooks a little i. e. niggardly <i>Brahmani</i>'; नखम्पचा यवागूः 'the nail-scorching barley gruel'.
