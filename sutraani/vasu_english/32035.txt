The affix खश् comes after the verb तुद् 'to strike' when विधु 'the moon' or अरुस् 'a wound' is the word in composition with it as object.
As विधुन्तुदः राहुः 'the <i>Rahu</i> that eclipses the moon; अरुन्तुदः 'corrosive, wounding the vital parts'. For the addition of the augment मुम् after the word अरुस्, see [[6.3.67]].
