The affix खच् comes after the verb वद् 'to speak' when प्रिय or वश is the word in composition with it as an object.
Thus प्रियं वदति = प्रियंवदः 'who speaks kindly'; वशंवदः 'who professes submission'.

Of the affix खच्, the letters ख् and च् are indicatory; ख् indicates the insertion of the augment मुम् [[6.3.67]], and च् shows that there is shortening of the vowel in certain cases [[6.4.94]].

In the case of प्रिय and वश with वद्, the affix खश् would have given the same result as the affix खच्. Making a separate affix in this <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of the aphorisms that follow, where this affix will produce different effects than खश्.

Vart:- The affix खच् comes after the verb गम् 'to go' when a word ending in a case-affix is in composition with it. As मितङ्गमो हस्ती 'the slow moving i. e. an elephant'; मितङ्गमा हस्तिनी 'the slow-moving i. e. a she-elephant'.

Vart:- This affix comes under similar circumstances when the word in composition with गम् is विहायस्; and the letter is then replaced by the word विह. As विहायसा गच्छति = विहङ्गमः 'a bird (that which goes through the sky)'.

Vart:- In the <i>Vartikas</i> above given, the affix खच् may optionally be considered as if it had an indicatory ड. The force of ड is to cause elision of the final vowel with what follows it. As विहङ्गः or विहङ्गमः 'a bird'. So also भुजङ्गमः or भुजङ्गः 'a serpent' (what goes crookedly).

Vart:- विहायस् is replaced by विह when the affix ड [[2.2.4]] comes after the verb गम्; as विहङ्गः 'a bird'. Thus we have three forms: विहग, विहङ्ग, विहङ्गम ।
