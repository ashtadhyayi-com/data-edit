The affix खच् comes after the verb ताप् 'to heat' when द्विषत् or पर is the word in composition with it as an object.
The verb तप् belongs both to <i>Bhu</i> and <i>Chur</i> classes. Both are meant in the <i>sutra</i>. In the case of <i>Bhvadi</i>, the verb तापि is the causative ending in णि of तप्; while in <i>Churadi</i>, all verbs take णि.

Thus द्विषन्तं तापयति = द्विषन्तपः [[6.4.94]] 'one who destroys his enemies', so also परन्तपः 'one who subdues his enemies, a hero'.

This affix however, will not apply when the above <i>upapadas</i> are in the feminine gender. In this case the general affix अण् will be employed; as द्विषतीं तापयति = दिषतीतापः ।
