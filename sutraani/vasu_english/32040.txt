The affix खच् comes after the verb यस् 'to curb' when the word वाक् 'speech' is in composition with it as an object and the sense indicated is that of a vow.
The word व्रत means a vow taken according to the rules of <i>Dharma</i> <i>sastra</i>. Thus वाचंयम आस्ते 'he has taken the vow of rigid silence'.

Why do we say 'vow'? Otherwise the form is वाग्यामः 'restraining speech' [[6.3.69]].
