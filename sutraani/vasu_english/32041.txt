The affix खच् comes after the verb दारि 'to split' and सह् 'to bear' when respectively in composition with the words पुर् 'a city' and सर्व 'all', as objects.
As पुरं धारयति = पुरन्दरः 'name of <i>Indra</i> (who splits asunder cities)' [[6.3.69]] and [[6.4.94]]; सर्वंसहो राजा 'the king who is all-forbearing'.
Vart:- So also when the word भग is in composition with the verb दारि; as भगन्दरः 'a fistula in the anus'.
