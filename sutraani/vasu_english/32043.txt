The affix खच् comes after the verb कृ 'to make' when the words मेघ 'cloud' अर्ति 'misfortune' and भय 'fear' are in composition as objects.
As मेघङ्करः 'producing clouds'; ऋर्तिकरः 'giving pain'; भयङ्करः 'frightful'.

Vart:- The <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> applies in the case of <i>upapadas</i> like भय. &c. This is an exception to the <i>vartika</i> under (1.1. 72.) by which, in the case of affixes, <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> was prohibited. Thus we have अभयङ्करः 'who causes security'.
