And the affix अण् as well as खच् come after the verb कृ 'to make' when the words क्षेम 'happiness', प्रिय 'pleasant' and भद्र 'joy' are in composition as objects.
The word 'and' denotes that the affix खच् is also to be included.

Thus क्षेमकारः or क्षेमकरः 'propitious'; प्रियकारः or प्रियङ्करः 'showing kindness'; मद्रकारः or मद्रङ्करः 'causing delight'. 

The repetition of the affix अण्, when its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been read into this <i>sutra</i> by using the word वा 'optionally', indicates that these words never take the affix ट of <i>sutra</i> 20 though cause, habit, &c., may be denoted; so that the feminine of those words is formed by आ and not by ई; as अल्पारम्भाः क्षेमकराः 'small beginnings lead to or cause prosperity'.
