The affix खच् comes after the verb भू 'to be' when in composition with the case-inflected word आशित 'satisfied by eating' and the sense is that of instrument or condition.
The word 'सुपि' of <i>sutra</i> 4 is understood here.

Thus आशिसम्भवः meaning 'food', literally that by which one is satiated. आशिती भवती अनेन. Here the word denotes instrument. And आशितसम्भवः also means 'satiety', which denotes condition.
