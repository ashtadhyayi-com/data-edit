The affix ड comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when it is compounded with the preposition अप् and when the object in composition with it, is the word क्लेश 'pain' or तमस् 'darkness'.
As, क्लेशापहः पुत्रः 'the pain-allayer i. e. the son'; तमोपहः सूर्यः 'the darkness-destroyer i. e. the sun'.

This aphorism has its scope when the sense is not that of benediction.
