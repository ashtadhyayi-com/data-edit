The affix क्विन् comes after the verb स्पृश् 'to touch' when it is in composition with a case-inflected word other than उदक 'water'.
By <i>sutra</i> 4 of this chapter, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word सुपि is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. It might be objected 'why do we not read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word कर्म instead of सुपि, because the verb स्पृश् is a transitive verb, and after such verbs, the <i>anuvritti</i> of कर्म ought to come by <i>sutra</i> 4'? To this we say there is no harm in reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of सुपि in this case; because the word कर्तरि of the last <i>sutra</i> is also, in a way understood here, and indicates the collection of all sorts of agents whether objects, instruments &c., and this can only be when the first member of the compound is a word in general.

Thus घृतं स्पृशति = घृतस्पृश्, nom. sing. घृतस्पृक् 'he who touches clarified butter'. स्पृश् + क्विन् + सु = स्पृश् + वि + ० [[6.1.68]] = स्पृक् + ० [[6.1.67]] and [[8.2.62]]. So also मन्त्रेण स्पृशति = मन्त्रस्पृक् 'who touches with hymns'; जलेन स्पृशति = जलस्पृक् 'who touches with water'. But उदकेन स्पृशति = उदकस्पर्शः; here we have the general affix अण्.

The न् of क्विन् is to distinguish this affix from affixes like क्विप् &c. For, had it been merely क्वि, then in <i>sutra</i> [[8.2.62]] we should have used क्वि प्रत्ययस्य कुः, and it would have been ambiguous, for क्वि might be explained as meaning both क्वि and क्विप्, as क्य means क्यष्, क्यप् &c. To remove this ambiguity, न् is added to make a distinctive affix. The न् cannot be for the sake of accent. [[6.1.117]], the verb being monosyllabic would of itself have taken that accent.
