The words - 1. ऋत्विक् 'a domestic priest' 2. दधृक् 'impudent' 3. स्रक् 'a garland' 4. दिक् 'direction' and 5. उष्णिक् 'a quatrain', are irregularly formed by adding the affix क्विन् and also after the verbs 6. अञ्चु 'to worship' 7. युजि 'to join' 8. क्रुञ्चु 'to approach', the affix क्विन् is used.
The first five words are irregular forms. Thus ऋतु + यज् + क्विन् = ऋत्विक् 'he who performs sacrifice in the season (ऋतौ) or to the season (ऋतुम्). This word, however is a रूढि word in which it is fruitless to search for its etymological meaning. धृष् + क्विन् = दधृक्. Here there is reduplication and the final has acute accent. सृज् + क्विन् = स्रक्. Here there is augment अस्. दृश् + क्विन् = दिक्. So also उत् + स्निह् + क्विन् = उष्णिक्. All these are in fact crude nouns, their current meaning having little traces of their root meaning.

The affix क्विन् comes after the three roots युज्, अञ्चु, and क्रुञ्च. Being read along with the five above-mentioned irregularly-formed words, there is some irregularity in the application of क्विन् to these verbs. Thus the affix क्विन् comes after अञ्चु only when a word ending with any case-affix precedes it in composition. As प्र + अञ्चु + क्विन् = प्राञ्च् nom. sing. प्राङ् [[6.4.24]]; [[7.1.70]], (VIII.2.23 and 62) 'east'; so also प्रत्यङ् 'west'; उदङ् 'north'.

The affix क्विन् comes after युजिर् and क्रुञ्च् when these are uncombined. Thus युज् + क्विन् = युज्. In nominative singular, युज् + सु = युञ्ज् + स् [[7.1.71]] = युञ्ज् + ० [[6.1.68]] = युङ् [[8.2.62]] 'who joins'. When the root युज् is in composition with an <i>upapada</i>, it takes the affix क्विप् (see <i>sutra</i> 61). As अश्वयुक् 'yoked with horses'.

So also क्रुञ्च् + क्विन् = क्रुञ्च्, nom. sing. क्रुङ्, 'a curlew'. The non-elision of the ञ [[6.4.24]] of क्रुञ्च् is an irregularity, as this word has been taught in connection with other irregular words.
