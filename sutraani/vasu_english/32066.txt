The affix ञ्युट् comes in the छन्दस् (Vedas) after the verb वह् 'to carry' when it is in composition with the word हव्य 'an oblation to gods', provided that the word so formed does not occur in the middle of a पाद (4th part of a stanza).
As अग्निश्च हव्यवाहनः 'fire, the carrier of oblation to the gods'. (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. I.44.2).

When this word occurs in the middle of a <i>pada</i>, or at the beginning, the form is हव्यवाट्, which is derived by adding the affix ण्वि (<i>sutra</i> (64)). As हव्यवाडग्निरजरः पिता नः 'the never-decaying <i>agni</i> or fire that carries oblation to the gods, is our father'. (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. III.2.2.)
