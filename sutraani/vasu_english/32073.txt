The affix विच् comes after the verb यज् 'to sacrifice' when उप precedes it, in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
As उपयङ्भिरूर्ध्वं वहन्ति 'they carry it up with the उपयज् formulas'. उपयज् is the name of eleven formulas at a sacrifice.

The word '<i>Chhandas</i>' has been repeated here though the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word '<i>mantra</i>' was present in it, in order to include the <i>Brahmana</i> literature also.

The च् is indicatory and is useful in including the affix विच् in the larger group called वि (which includes क्विन्, क्विप्, ण्वि, विट्), as in the <i>sutra</i> येरपृक्तस्य [[6.1.67]].

Why has this <i>sutra</i> been made, since the affix विच् would have been valid even by aphorism 75? The <i>sutra</i> has been separately made to show that it is a restrictive rule here. The form उपयज् is found in the <i>Chhandas</i> only, and not in the ordinary literature.
