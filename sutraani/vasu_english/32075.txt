These affixes i.e. - मनिन् (मन्), वनिप् (वन्), विनय (वन्) and विच् are seen after other verbs also besides those ending in long आ।
The word छन्दसि is not understood here. As सु + शृ 'to injure' + मनिन् = सुशर्मन्, 1st. sing. सुशर्मा 'who destroys well i.e. destroys sin or ignorance'. प्रातर् + इ 'to go' + क्वनिप् = प्रातर् + इत् + वन् [[6.1.71]] = प्रातरित्वन्, 1st. sing. प्रातरित्वा 'who goes early'. वि + जन् + वनिप् = वि + जा + वन् [[6.4.41]] = विजावन्. 1st. sing. विजावा 'who brings forth'. अग्रेगावा 'who goes before'. रिप् + विच् = रेष् [[7.3.86]] 1st. sing. रेड् 'who injures'; as in रेडसि पर्णं नयेः (<i>Yajur</i>. <i>Ved</i>. VI.18).

The word 'also' in this aphorism has the force of removing all conditions under which these affixes were employed in the previous aphorisms, that is to say, these affixes come even when there is no <i>upapada</i>. As पीवा, धीवा.

The words 'are seen' in this <i>sutra</i> show that all verbs do not admit of these affixes indiscriminately. It is only when we see a particular form that we can infer the existence of these affixes.
