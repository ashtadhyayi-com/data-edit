When habit is to be expressed, the affix णिनि comes after a verb, provided the word with a case-affix in composition with it does not mean a genus.
Thus उष्ण + भुज् + णिनि = उष्णभोजिन्, 1st. sing. उष्णभोजी 'who eats his meal hot'. So also शीतभोजी &c.

Why do we say 'when it does not mean a genus'? Witness ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयिता 'the inviter of <i>Brahmanas</i>'. We cannot form ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयी

Why do we say 'when habit is to be expressed'? Witness उष्णं भुङ्क्ते कदाचित् 'he sometimes eats hot'.

Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word '<i>supi</i>' was understood in this aphorism, its repetition here declares that <i>upasargas</i> are not included. This is contested by the author of the <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>. According to him this affix comes even with <i>upasargas</i>. As अनुनायित्, अनुजीविन्, उपजीविन् &c.

Vart:- The verb आसृ in composition with the prepositions उत् or प्रति should be enumerated as taking this affix. As उदासारिन्, fem. उदासारिणी, 1st. plural उदासारिण्यः. So also प्रत्यासारिणी, pl. प्रत्यासारिण्यः ।

Vart:- So also when the sense is 'having skill in such and such action'. As साधुकारी 'excellent worker'; साधुदायी 'giving liberally'.

Vart:- So also after the verb वद preceded by ब्रह्म. As ब्रह्मवादिन्, in ब्रह्मवादिनो वदन्ति 'the knowers of <i>Brahma</i> say'.
