The affix णिनि comes after a verb diversely when continued repitition of an action is to be expressed.
The word आभीक्ष्ण्य means continued repetition, that is to say, zealous practice or assiduous performance of anything, but does not mean habit. As कषायपायिणो गान्धाराः 'the people of <i>Gandhara</i> are <i>kashaya</i>-drinkers'. कषाय + पा + णिनि = कषाय + पा + युक् + णिनि [[7.3.33]]. So also क्षीरपायिण उशीनाराः 'the people of <i>Usinara</i> are milk-drinkers'. सौवीर-पायिणो बाह्लीकाः 'the people of <i>Bahlika</i> are <i>sauvira</i>-drinkers'.
 
By using the word 'diversely' in the <i>sutra</i>, this affix is not applied in other places, as in the following :- कुल्माषखादः 'a grain eater'.
