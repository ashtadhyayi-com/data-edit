All the affixes to be treated of hereafter should be understood to come in the sense of past time.
The phrase 'with the sense of past time' is an <i>adhikara</i> or governing aphorism and exerts its influence up to aphorism 123 of this chapter; that is to say, these affixes give a signification of the past tense to the verb whose <i>anuvritti</i> is also understood throughout the subsequent <i>sutras</i>; see [[3.1.91]].

Thus it will be taught in the next aphorism: 'after the verb यज्, when the word in composition is in the instrumental case, the affix णिनि is employed'. Here to complete the sense we must read into the <i>sutra</i>, the words 'with the sense of past time'. As अग्निष्टोमेनेष्टवान् = अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् 'who has sacrificed with an <i>Agnishtoma</i> or a five-day series of offerings'.

Why do we say 'with the sense of past time' ? Otherwise these affixes will not be employed. As अग्निष्टोमेन यजति 'he sacrifices with <i>Agnishtoma</i>'.
