The affix णिनि comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' with the sense of past time, when the word in composition is in the Accusative -2nd case.
As पितृव्यघातिन् 'who has killed his paternal uncle'; मातुलघातिन् 'who has killed his maternal uncle'; हन् + णिनि = घन् + णिनि [[7.3.54]] = घत् + णिनि [[7.3.32]] = घातिन् [[7.2.116]].

This affix is employed only when censure is implied. Therefore it is not employed in चोरं हतवान् 'he has killed the thief'.

The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word कर्मणि of this aphorism extends up to <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.96]].
