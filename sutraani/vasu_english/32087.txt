The affix क्विप्comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' with the sense of past time when the following words in the Accusative -2nd case ae in composition - 1. भ्रूण 'a foetus' 2. वृत्र ।
As ब्रह्महन्, 1st. sing. ब्रह्महा 'who has killed a <i>Brahmana</i>'; भ्रूणहा 'who has killed a foetus'; वृत्रहा 'who has killed <i>Vritra</i>, a name of <i>Indra</i>'.

Since by <i>sutra</i> 76 <i>ante</i>, the affix क्विप् was ordained to come after all verbs, and therefore would have come after the verb हन् also, where is the necessity of the present aphorism? This aphorism makes a <i>niyama</i>. i.e. the verb हन् takes the affix क्विप् only when it is in composition with the words ब्रह्म &c. Four-fold restriction is here intended.

(1) When हन् has <i>upapada</i>, the words ब्रह्म &c., and not any other word; as पुरुषं हतवान् 'he has killed the man'.

(2) When the words ब्रह्म &c. are <i>upapadas</i> of any other verb than हन्, then this affix is not employed; so that the verb must be हन्; thus ब्रह्माधीतवान् 'he has read the <i>Veda</i>'.

(3) The क्विप् is the only affix to denote past time in the case of हन् preceded by ब्रह्म &c., and no other affix can be employed in this sense.

(4) This is employed only in the past tense and not in any other tense; as ब्रह्माणं हन्ति or हनिष्यति 'he kills or will kill the <i>Brahmana</i>'. This <i>sutra</i> anticipates the diversity taught in the next <i>sutra</i>, and is an example of बहुलं use of the affix.
