In the छन्दस् (Vedas) the affix क्विप्diversely comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' with the sense of past time,ending with the word even when the word in composition with it is other than those mentioned in the last sūtra.
This aphorism ordains क्विप् in cases which are not governed by the restrictive rule contained in the last aphorism. As मातृहा सप्तमं नरकं प्रविशेत् 'may the matricide enter the seventh hell'; so also पितृहा 'patricide'.

Diversely we find also मातृघातः and पितृघातः।
