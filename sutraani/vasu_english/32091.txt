The affix क्विप्comes after the verb चि 'to collect' with the sense of past time, when the word अग्नि , in the Accusative -2nd case, is in composition.
As, अग्निचित् 'one who has kept the sacred fire'; 1st. dual अग्निचितौ; 1st. plural अग्निचितः ।

Here also, as in the last aphorism, four-fold restriction is intended.
