The affix क्वनिप् comes after the verb दृश् 'to see' in the sense of past time, when in composition with a word in the Accusative -2nd case.
As मेरुदृश्वन्, 1st. sing. मेरुदृश्वा 'who has seen the Meru'. परलोकदृश्वा 'who has seen the hereafter.'

Though the affix क्वनिप् was valid by <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.75]] its repetition here shows that no other affix comes in this sense after this verb.
