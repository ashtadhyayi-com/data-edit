The affix क्वनिप् comes after the verbs युध 'to fight' and कृ 'to make' with a past signification when the word राजन् 'king' is in composition, in the Accusative -2nd case.
How can the verb युध्, which is an intransitive verb, govern an object ? It is a transitive verb, in as much as it is taken to be a causative verb, with the णिच् affix latent. As राजयुध्वन्,1st. sing. राजयुध्वा [[8.2.7]] 'who has caused the king to fight'; राजकृत्वन्, 1st. sing. राजकृत्वा (VI.1.71.) 'who has made a king'.
