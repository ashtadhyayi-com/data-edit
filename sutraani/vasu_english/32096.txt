The affix क्वनिप् comes after the verbs युध 'to fight' and कृ 'to make' with a past signification when the word सह 'with', is in composition.
The word सह, being a particle, and not denoting a substance, is incapable of taking any case. As सहयुध्वन् 'who has made to fight with'; सहकृत्वन् 'who has done any thing along with another'.
