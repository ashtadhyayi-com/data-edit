The affix ड comes after the verb जन् 'to be produced', with a past signification, when an उपसर्ग is in composition and when the sense is simply appellative.
The term here being simply appellative, and not descriptive, cannot be explained by giving the signification of its component elements. As प्रजाः 'people', or 'a son'; as in the sentence अथेमा मानवी प्रजाः ।
