In the छन्दस् (Vedas), the affix लिट् (Perfect Tense) is optionally replaced by the affix कानच्।
As अग्निं चिक्यानः 'he consecrated the fire'; सोमं सुषुवाणः 'he pressed the <i>soma</i> juice'. This being an optional affix, is sometimes not employed; as in the examples in the last aphorism.

Why has the word <i>lit</i> been repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, when its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been drawn from the last <i>sutra</i> ? The substitute कानच् replaces not only the special लिट् of <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.105]], but the general लिट् which comes after the roots in forming the perfect tense; so that the affix कानच् forms verbal adjectives as well as the perfect tense.

This affix comes after those verbs only which take <i>Atmanepada</i> terminations. See [[1.4.100]]. तूतुजान (<i>Rig</i>. <i>Ved</i>. [[1.3.6]]).
