In the छन्दस् (Vedas) the affix क्वसु is optionally the substitute for लिट् ।
As जक्षिवस् 1st. sing. जक्षिवान् 'eaten' (<i>Yaj</i>. (VIII.19)); पपिवस् 1st. sing. पपिवान् 'drunk'.

Sometimes it does not come, as in the example under <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.105]]; अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श.

The division of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, in which it could well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>, into which the <i>anuvritti</i> of क्वसु only runs.
