The affix लुङ् (Aorist) comes after a verbal root used in the sense of past before the commencement of the current day.
The word अनद्यतन is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound, meaning that which has not occurred during the course of the current day (<i>adyatana</i>). The whole of this affix is replaced by conjugational terminations, and the affix लङ् by itself denotes the Imperfect tense. As अकरोत् 'he did'; अहरत् 'he took'.

Why have we explained <i>anadyatana</i> as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound? Because when there is a doubt as to the time, whether it was to-day or yesterday, there the Imperfect should not be used. As अद्य ह्यो वा अभुञ्ज्महि 'we ate to-day or yesterday'. In such a case the affix is लुङ्.

Vart:- The affix लङ् is also employed in signifying what is not witnessed by the narrator, when it relates to a well-known public event which can form the object of perception by the narrator. Thus in speaking of a recent public occurrence we may say :-अरुणद् यवनः साकेतम् 'the <i>Yavanas</i> have besieged <i>Saketa</i>'; अरुणद् यवनः माध्यमिकान् 'the <i>Yavanas</i> have besieged <i>Madhyamika</i>'.

Why do we say 'not witnessed by the speaker'? Observe उदगात् आदित्यः 'the sun arose'. Why do we say 'a popular public event' ? Observe चकार कट देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> has made the mat'. Why do we say 'which is the object of perception by the speaker'? Observe जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः '<i>Vasudeva</i> killed <i>Kansa</i>'.
