When a word implying 'recollection' is in connection with it, a verb takes the affix लृट् (2nd Future) in the sense of the past before the commencement of the present day.
The word अभिज्ञा means 'recollection'. This rule sets aside the affix लङ्. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामः 'rememberest thou, <i>Devadatta</i>, we were dwelling (lit. we will dwell) in <i>Kashmir</i>'.

The word वचन meaning 'signification' in the <i>sutra</i>, denotes that the construction is the same when the synonyms of अभिज्ञा are used; as स्मरसि 'dost thou remember'; बुध्यसे 'dost thou know'; चेतयसे 'dost thou reflect'; and the like.
