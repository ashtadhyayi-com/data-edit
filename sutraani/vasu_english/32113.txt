The affix लृट् (2nd Future) is not applied in the sense of the past when the उपपद denoting recollection has in connection with it the particle यत्।
This prohibits लृट् which the verb वस् obtained from the last <i>sutra</i>. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत् कश्मीरेष्ववसाम 'thou rememberest <i>Devadatta</i> how we did dwell in <i>Kashmir</i>'. Here the mere fact of dwelling is recollected, there being no other idea implied; therefore the subsequent aphorism has no scope here. That aphorism has its scope, when with recollection, is added another dependent idea or action, without which the sentence is not complete.
