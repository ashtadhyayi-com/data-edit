And the affix लङ् (Imperfect Tense) comes after the verb when the particles ह and शश्वत are in connection with it and when the verb denotes past action unperceived by the speaker and before the commencement of the current day.
The force of च 'and' is that the affix लिट् (perfect) may also be employed in similar construction. As इति हाकरोत् (imperfect), or इति ह चकार (perfect) 'Alas ! he did it'. शश्वदकरोत् or शश्वच्चकार 'again and again he did it'.
