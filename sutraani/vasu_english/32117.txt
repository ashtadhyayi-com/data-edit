The affixes लङ् (Imperfect Tense) and लिट् (Perfect Tense) come after a verb (in expressing a past time not belonging to the current day and unperceived by the speaker) when the past referred to is recent and the sentence is interrogative.
This <i>sutra</i> also qualifies the words भूत, अनद्यतन and परोक्ष understood in this <i>sutra</i>. The word प्रश्न means 'what should be asked'; and आसन्नकाल 'time close at hand': As, some one may ask another, अगच्छत् देवदत्तः, or जगाम देवदत्तः 'did <i>Devadatta</i> go or has <i>Devadatta</i> gone (just now)'? अयजद् देवदत्तः or इयाज देवदत्तः 'Did <i>Devadatta</i> sacrifice or has <i>Devadatta</i> sacrificed'?

Why do we say 'in asking question'? Otherwise there would be Perfect tense only. As, जगाम देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> has gone'.

Why do we say 'when the past time referred to is imminently recent'? Observe भवन्तं पृच्छामि, जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः 'I ask you, did <i>Krishna</i> indeed kill <i>Kansa</i> in days of yore'.
