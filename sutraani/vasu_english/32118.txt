The affix लट् (Present Tense) comes after a verb when the particle स्म is in connection with it (and denotes a past time not belonging to the current day and unperceived by the speaker). Note : This debars लिट् (Perfect Tense) .
All the words within brackets are understood in this aphorism. This debars लिट् or the perfect tense. Thus यजति स्म युधिष्ठिरः '<i>Yudhishthira</i> sacrificed'; so also नलेन स्म पुराधीयते । उर्णया स्म पराधीयते ॥
