The affix लट् (Present Tense) is used after a verb in denoting a past action when the word ननु is in connection with it and an answer is given to the question.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words '<i>anadyatana</i>' and '<i>paroksha</i>' does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. This declares a rule with regard to past time in general. This debars लुङ् (the Aorist tense). As अकार्षीः कटं देवदत्त ? -- ननु करोमि भोः '<i>Devadatta</i>, did you make the mat? O, yes, I did make it'. अवोचस्तत्र किञ्चिद् देवदत्त,- - ननु ब्रवीमि भोः '<i>Devadatta</i>, did you speak there anything? O, yes, I did speak'.

Why do we say 'in reply to an interrogation'? Observe नन्वकार्षीन्  माणवकः 'certainly, <i>Manavaka</i> did it'.
