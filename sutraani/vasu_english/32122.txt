Optionally the affixes लुङ् (Aorist) and लट् (Present Tense) come after a verb in denoting past time not belonging to the current day, when the word पुरा is used in the sentence, provided that the word स्म is not used.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>anadyatana</i> which had come to a stop with [[3.2.120]] manifests itself again in this <i>sutra</i> by a process of jumping over the two intermediate aphorisms. This sort of <i>anuvritti</i> is technically called <i>manduka</i>-<i>pluti</i> 'the leap of a frog' i. e. skipping of several <i>sutras</i> and supplying a word from a previous <i>sutra</i>.

This is an optional rule, so that when <i>lat</i> and <i>lun</i> are not used, the proper tenses, as the case may be, must be employed. As वसन्तीह पुरा छात्राः 'the pupils lived here formerly'. So also, Aorist, अवात्सुः पुरा छात्राः; Imperfect, अवसन्निह पुरा छात्राः; Perfect, ऊषुरिह पुरा छात्राः ।

Why do we say 'when the word स्म is not used'? Observe यजति स्म पुरा युधिष्टिरः '<i>Yudhishthira</i> did perform a sacrifice formerly'. Here rule 118 <i>ante</i> exerts its influence.
