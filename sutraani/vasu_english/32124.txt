The affixes शतृ and शानच् are substitutes of लट् (Present Tense) when agreeing with what does not end with the 1st (Nominative Case) case-affix.
As पचमानं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold <i>Devadatta</i> who is cooking'; पचता कृतम् or पचमानेन कृतम् 'done by one who is cooking'. पच् + शानच् = पच् + शप् + शानच् [[3.4.113]], [[3.1.68]] = पच् + अ + मुक् + आन [[7.2.82]] = पचमान । So also पच् + शप् + शतृ = पच् + अ + अत् = पचत् ।

Why do we say 'when agreeing with what does not end with the first case-affix' ? Observe देवदत्तः पचति '<i>Devadatta</i> cooks'.

Since the term लट् might have been supplied from the last aphorism, its double citation is for the sake of larger application of this rule; that is to say, this rule applies sometimes even when the word is in concord with a nominative case. As सन् ब्राह्मणः 'who is a <i>Brahmana</i>' = अस्ति ब्राह्मणः; so also विद्यते ब्राह्मणः and विद्यमानो ब्राह्मणः; जुहुत् and जुहोति; and अधीयानः and अधीते ।

Vart:- These affixes are employed after a verb, when the particle माङ् is in composition, and censure or curse is implied. As मा पचन् and मा पचमानः 'may he not cook'; मा जीवन् यः परावज्ञादुःखदग्धोऽपि जीवति  'cursed be he (lit. may he not live) who though smitten by the pain of the contempt of others, still lives'. Some commentators read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word 'option' from <i>sutra</i> 121 into this. That option, however, is a limited option (<i>vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>) and not of universal application. Whenever a particular form is found as differing from the general form, there it should be understood that the option has been allowed, and not everywhere.
