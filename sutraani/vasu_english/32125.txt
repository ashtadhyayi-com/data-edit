The affixes शतृ and शानच् are substitutes of लट् (Present Tense) even when agreeing with what ends with a 1st (Nominative Case) case-affix, provided that it is in the Vocative Case.
This aphorism declares when these participles may be employed even in the first case; as हे पचन् or हे पचमान 'O thou who art cooking'.
