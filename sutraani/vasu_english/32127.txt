These two - शतृ and शानच् are called सत्.
These participial affixes get collectively this name; and as such they are not limited by the conditions enumerated above; so that they replace not only the affixes of the Present tense but sometimes of Future also [[3.3.14]], as well as other tenses. Thus ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वन्, करिष्यन्, कुर्वाणः, करिष्यमाणः ।

The word सत् occurs in <i>sutra</i> [[2.2.11]] &c.
