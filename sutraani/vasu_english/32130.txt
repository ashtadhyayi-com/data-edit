The affix शतृ comes after the verb इङ् 'to go' and धारि 'to hold' in denoting that the agent does the action without trouble.
The word अकृच्छ्र means that which is accomplished by the agent with ease and facility. As अधीयन् पारायणम् 'the facile reading of the <i>Purana</i>'; धारयन्नुपनिषदम् 'easily mastering the <i>Upanishad</i>'. The root धारि is causative of धृ and means here 'to master'.
 
Why do we say 'when facility is indicated'? Otherwise कृच्छ्रेणाधीते 'he reads with difficulty'; कृच्छ्रेण धारयति 'he remembers with difficulty'.
