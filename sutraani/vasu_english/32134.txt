From this sūtra as far as क्विप् in sūtra [[3.4.177]] (inclusive), the affixes that we shall treat of, are to be understood in the sense of agents having such a habit or nature or having skill in such and such action.
The force of आ in this <i>sutra</i> is limit inclusive, and includes क्विप् also. The term तच्छील means 'the natural inclination towards an action not prompted by a contemplation of its fruit or result'. The term तद्धर्म means 'who enters upon an action not from habit but thinking that it is his duty'. The term तत्साधुकारि means 'who does the action expressed by the verb in an excellent way'. Illustrations of these will be given under the subsequent aphorisms.
