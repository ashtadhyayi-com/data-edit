The affix क्स्नु comes after the following verbs in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit etc.' viz. - 1. ग्ला 'to be weary' 2. जि 'to conquer' 3. स्था 'to stand', as well as after भू 'to be'.
As, ग्लास्नुः 'languid'; जिष्णुः 'victorious'; स्थास्नुः 'disposed to stand firm, immoveable'; भूष्णुः 'being'.

The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>Chhandasi</i> does not extend to this <i>sutra</i>. The indicatory letter of this affix is really ग and not क, and therefore, there is no substitution of long ई for the आ of स्था, which would otherwise have taken place, had the affix been कित् [[6.4.66]].

In the <i>sutra</i> (l. 1.5.) (क्ङिति च) the letter ग is also included; for ग coming before क, is changed by the rules of <i>sandhi</i> into क and is not therefore visible. This affix therefore does not cause <i>guna</i>.

So also in <i>sutra</i> (VII.2. II) (श्रयुकः किति), the augment इट् does not come after the verb स्नु, or a monosyllabic verb ending in the <i>pratyahara</i> उक, when an affix having an indicatory क follows. Here also क includes ग; and therefore in भूष्णु we have no intermediate augment इट्.

Vart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> this affix comes after the verb दंश 'to bite'; as दङ्क्ष्णवः पशवः 'the beasts that bite'.
