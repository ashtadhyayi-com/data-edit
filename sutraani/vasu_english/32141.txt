The affix घिनुण् comes after the 8 verbs beginning with शम् 'to be calm' in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit etc.'.
The word इति in the aphorism indicates beginning. These eight verbs begin with शम् and end with मद in the list of verbs. Of the affix घिनुण् the real affix is इन्, the other letters are servile; the घ is for the sake of substituting guttural for the final palatals; उ is for the sake of euphony, or for the sake of rule [[6.3.45]]; and the letter ण् causes <i>vriddhi</i> [[7.2.116]]: which in the case of roots ending in म is prohibited by the rule [[7.3.34]], the only verb taking '<i>vriddhi</i>' being मद् ।

As शमिन् Ist. sing. शमी 'calm'; likewise तमी 'desiring'; दमी 'taming'; श्रमी 'laborious'; भ्रमी 'whirling', 'moving round'; क्लमी 'fatiguing'; क्षमी 'forbearing'; प्रमादी 'mad' and उन्मादी 'mad'. Though by rule 136, the verb उन्मद takes the affix इष्णुच्, it also takes the affix घिनुण् by the rule of वाऽमरूप [[3.1.94]].

All these verbs belong to the <i>Divadi</i> class. After other verbs than these eight, we have other affixes; as असिता.
