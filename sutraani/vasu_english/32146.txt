The affix वुञ् is added to the following verbs in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit etc.' - 1. निन्द् 2. हिंस् 3. क्लिश् 4. खाद् 5. विनाश् 6. परिक्षिप् 7. परिरट् 8. व्याभाष् and असूय।
In this <i>sutra</i> the whole phrase ending with असूय has taken the termination of the first case; which, however, has the force of the ablative here.

As निन्द् + वुञ् = निन्दकः (VII.I.I) 'blaming'; so also हिंसकः 'injuring'; क्लेशकः 'tormenting or troublesome'; खादकः 'eating'; विनाशकः 'destroying'; परिक्षेपकः 'surrounding'; परिराटकः 'who cries aloud'; परिवादकः 'a plaintiff'; व्याभाषकः 'detracting'; and असूयकः 'detracting'.

The same forms as the above would have been obtained by adding the affix ण्वुल taught in [[3.1.133]], as by adding वुञ्; its separate enunciation indicates the existence of this <i>paribhasha</i> :-

"The rule of [[3.1.94]] by which an <i>apavada</i>-affix which is not uniform with an <i>utsarga</i>-affix should supersede the latter only optionally, has no concern with <i>apavada</i>-affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit' i. e. with the affixes taught in (III.2.134-177)". Therefore the affixes तृच् &c, are not added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'.
