The affix ऊक comes in the sense of 'agent having such a habit etc.' after the verbs 1. यज् 2. जप् 3. दश् when they end in the affix य्।
The intensives of these verbs take ऊक. As यायजूकः 'a performer of frequent sacrifices'; जञ्जपूकः 'a mutterer of prayers repeatedly'; दन्दशूकः 'a snake (what bites frequently)'.
