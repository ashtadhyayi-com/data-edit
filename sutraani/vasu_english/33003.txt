The words गामि etc. are valid forms having the sense of the future time.
The force of the future time is in the affix, and is so ordained, and not in the original word which takes the affix. Thus we see that the <i>Unadi</i> affixes, in a way, do come with the force of not only present, but past and future also, though in the latter two cases its scope is very limited. As गमी ग्रामम् 'intending to go to the village'; आगामी 'that which has to come' So also प्रस्थायी 'departing'; प्रतिरोधी 'an opponent', (who is going to obstruct). प्रतिबोधी 'going to be awakened'. So also प्रतियोधी 'an adversary'; प्रतियोगी 'an enemy'; प्रतियायी; आयायी; भावी, &c.

Vart:- The Future, for the purposes of this rule, must be <i>anadyatana</i> future i. e. the affix should come in the sense of what will happen but not in the course of the current day. In other words, the force must be of the first future लुट्, and not of the second future लृट्. As श्वो गमी ग्रामम् 'he intends to go to the village tomorrow'.
