And when the success, that would accrue to another by fulfilling the desire of the speaker, is indicated in a sentence, the present tense may optionally be used with the force of the futurity.
The word 'optionally' is also understood here. The word लिप्स्यमानसिद्धिः is equal to लिप्स्यमानात् सिद्धि, an Ablative-<i>Tatpurusha</i> Compound, signifying <i>siddhi</i> or success, that would be acquired by another by complying with the request of the speaker. The difference between this and the last <i>sutra</i> is, that whereas the last related to interrogative sentences having किम् in construction, the present relates to sentences in general. As यो भक्तं ददाति, स स्वर्गं गच्छति 'he who gives food, goes to heaven'; यो भक्तं दास्यति or दाता, स स्वर्गं गमिष्यति or गन्ता.

Here the speaker encourages the giver to the act of charity by holding out the hope, that from rice which is the object desired (लिप्स्यमान) the success (सिद्धि), in the shape of <i>svarga</i>, will accrue to the giver.

In other words, 'the present is sometimes used for the future in conditional sentences, i.e., it is employed in connection with a sentence declaring the compensation or reward which follows from the granting of the wish'.
