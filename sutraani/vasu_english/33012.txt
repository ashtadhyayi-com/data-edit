The affix अण् comes after a root with the force of the future when the word in construction with it is in the Accusative -2nd case and when the action is performed for the sake of another action.
The word 'future' is understood here. The force of च is merely that of a connective particle. By rule [[3.2.1]] the affix अण् comes after a root when the word in composition is in the accusative case. That is a general injunction; and the rule of वाऽसरूप not applying, the affix ण्वुल would have debarred it as already said; hence this repetition. This rule being an <i>apavada</i> rule (an exception or a special rule with regard to those verbs which have the accusative case in composition) will thus, within its own jurisdiction, prevent the application of ण्वुल् of [[3.3.10]]; and by the rule of परत्व given in [[1.4.2]], it will debar the affixes like क &c. Therefore this अण् comes after even those verbs also which were especially exempted from its operation by rules like [[3.2.3]]. Thus by rule [[3.2.3]] the अण् of (III.2. I) could not have come after simple verbs ending in long आ, such as दा 'to give' &c. But the present अण् with a gerundial force will come even after such verbs. As गोदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give cows', and not गोदः । So also कम्बलदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give blanket'; अश्वदायो व्रजति । दा + अण् = दायः [[7.3.33]].

So also काण्डलावो व्रजति 'he goes to cut wood'. In this case अण् would have been applied even by [[3.2.1]].
