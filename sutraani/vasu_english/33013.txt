The affix लृट् (2nd Future) is used after a verb in the remaining cases where futurity pure and simple is indicated and also where there is construction with it another verb denoting an action performed for the sake of the future action.
This is what is well-known as the Second Future. As करिष्यामि इति व्रजति 'he goes that I will do'; हरिष्यामि इति व्रजति 'he goes that I will take'. So also, करिष्यति 'he will do'; हरिष्यति 'he will take'. Thus the Second Future is used both in dependent sentences as well as to denote simple Future.
