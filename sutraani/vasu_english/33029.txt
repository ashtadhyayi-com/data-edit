The affix घञ् comes after the root गॄ when the उपसर्ग-s उत् and नि are in composition.
The verb गृ here refers to both the verbs गृ 'to make sound', and गृ 'to swallow'. As उद्गारः समुद्रस्य 'the roaring of the sea'; निगारो देवदत्तस्य 'the swallowing of <i>Devadatta</i>'. But when without these prepositions, we have गरः ।
