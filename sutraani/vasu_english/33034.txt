The affix घञ् comes after the verb स्तॄ 'to cover' with the उपसर्ग वि when the word so formed is the name of a metre.
The word छन्द here means prosodial metre such as <i>Gayatri</i> & c; and not the Vedas; otherwise the word नाम would not have been used. Thus वि + स्तृ + घञ् = वि + स्तृ + घञ् [[8.3.94]] = विष्टारः 'the name of a metre called <i>Vishtara</i>-<i>Pankti</i>'.

The whole word विष्टारपङ्क्ति is the name of a metre, and is not a word ending with the affix <i>ghan</i>; only a member of this word, i.e. the first part ends with <i>ghan</i>. The seventh case-affix in the word छन्दोनाम्नि has the force of location i.e. when the word so formed occurs in a portion of a name of a metre; it is not the full name, but it is in the name i.e. forms a portion of the name.
