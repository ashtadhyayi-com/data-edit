The affix घञ् comes after the roots 1. नी 'to lead' 2. इ 'to go' when the prepositions परि and नि respectively in composition with them and when the words so formed respectively mean 'a game' and 'propriety or arrangement or law'.
Here again we take help of [[1.3.10]] in interpreting this <i>sutra</i>. The verbs परि + नी and नि + इ, take घञ् when respectively meaning 'gambling' and 'fitness'. As परिणायेन शारान् हन्ति 'he kills (or takes) many pieces by moving a chessman.' Here परिणायेन = समन्तान्नय means 'the moving of chess-pieces from every side, and so winning the game'. So also नि + इ + घञ् = नि + ऐ + अ = नि +  आय = न्यायः 'justice', 'propriety', 'logic'.

But when not having these senses, we have परिणयः 'marriage', and न्ययं 'decay'; as न्ययङ्गतः पापः 'the sin has been destroyed'. The word अभ्रेष means पदार्थानामनपचारो यथापापकरणम् ।
