The affix घञ् comes after the roots चि 'to collect' and क is the substitute of the initial च in the sense of 'a multitude or assembly' (of living beings possessing some common characteristics) but not merely a confused crowd of men.
The word सङ्घ means a collection or assembly of living beings. It is of two sorts:- either by collection of persons possessing common qualifications, or a mere confused crowd of men. The collection denoting a confused crowd is here excepted and by <i>paryudasa</i> negation the other is taken. Thus भिक्षुकनिकायः 'the assembly of beggars'; ब्राह्मणनिकायः 'the assembly of <i>Brahmanas</i>'; वैयाकरणनिकायाः 'the assembly of Grammarians'.

But सूकरनिचयः 'a herd of hogs'; because it is a mere collection. So also कृताकृतसमुच्चयः 'the collection of what is done and not done'; प्रमाणसमुच्चयः 'the collection of proofs'. Here there is no सङ्घ in either of the two senses, it not being a collection of living animals, the affix <i>ghan</i> is not employed.
