The affix णच् comes after a root in denoting reciprocity of action and the word so formed is in the feminine gender.
The word कर्म means 'action' and is not the technical '<i>Karma</i>' meaning the accusative case. व्यतिहार means reciprocity or interchange of action. The word so evolved is feminine in form and denotes mere 'action' (भाव) also. The <i>anubandha</i> च in णच् is qualitative and is added to distinguish this affix from other affixes: thus in <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.14]] this particular affix is meant.

Thus वि + अव + क्रुश् + णच् + अञ् + ङीष् = व्यावक्रोशी [[5.4.14]] and [[7.3.6]] 'mutual abuse'. So also व्यावहासी, व्यावलेखी. The affix णच् forms only an imaginary stem; for this stem must take the affix अञ् by [[5.4.14]], which even does not form the complete word until the affix ङीष् of the feminine is added.

Why do we say 'in the feminine'? Observe व्यतिपाको वर्तते ।

The making of this a separate <i>sutra</i> by itself and not reading it in the subdivision of feminine affixes beginning with क्तिन् [[3.3.94]] is for the sake of removing the obstructing aphorisms that would otherwise have prevented the application of this rule.

For, had it been taught in connection with क्तिन् &c, then the affixes that would have debarred क्तिन् &c, would a fortiori have debarred this also. But by keeping it separate from that class, it is indicated that those obstructive affixes which debar क्तिन् &c, do not debar this. Thus व्यावचोरी, व्यावचर्ची । Here चुर् being a ण्यन्त class root would have taken युच् [[3.3.107]] in the feminine, as चोरणा; and चर्च् would have taken अङ् by [[3.3.104]], as चर्चा. The roots ईक्ष् and ईह्, by [[3.3.102]] & [[3.3.103]], take अ by debarring क्तिन् । This debarring affix अ, however, is not debarred by this rule; as व्यतीक्षा, व्यतीहा are the proper feminine forms, and not व्यतीक्षी &c. The form व्यातुक्षी is, however, an apparent exception. All these exceptions, counter-exceptions &c. are examples of बहुलं taught in [[3.3.113]].
