The affix इनुण् comes after a root in denoting condition when co-extensiveness is meant.
The word अभिविधि means co-extensiveness, that is to say, the complete comprehension or relation between the action and the quality. Thus सांराविणम् 'a general or tumultuous uproar'; सं + कूट् + इन् + अण [[5.4.15]] and [[5.4.16]] = 'a general confusion'; so सांस्राविणम् 'a general flow or stream'.

Why do we say 'when meaning co-extensiveness'? Observe सङ्कोटः, संरावः, सन्द्रावः ।

Why do we use the word भाव again in this <i>sutra</i>, when its <i>anuvritti</i> was already flowing from <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.18]]? The object is that the वाऽसरूप rule [[3.1.94]] should not apply here and hence घञ् never comes in this sense. <i>Patanjali</i> says that the repetition is for the sake of indicating that in neuter gender, when co-extensiveness is expressed, the affixes क्त &c. are prohibited; so that the affixes क्त &c. should not come in the neuter with the force of भाव ।

The separateness of this <i>sutra</i> is for the same purpose as the last aphorism. The affix ल्युट् is not, however, prohibited; as सङ्कुटनम्. See rule कृत्यल्युटो बहुलं [[3.3.113]]. The affix इनुण् (the operative part being इन्) forms but an imaginary stem, which does not become real and complete till it takes the affix अण् by [[5.4.15]], as shown above.
