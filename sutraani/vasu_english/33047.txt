The affix घञ् comes after the root ग्रह् 'to seize' in composition with परि when it relates to sacrificial subjects.
As उत्तरपरिग्राहः 'the northern fencing of the sacrificial altar'; अधरपरिग्राहः 'the southern fencing of the sacrificial altar'.

Why do we say 'when relating to sacrifices'? Observe परिग्रहः देवदत्तस्य 'the fencing of <i>Devadatta</i>'.
