The affix घञ् is optionally used after the root ग्रह् 'to seize' in composition with प्र when the word so formed relates to commerce.
Both the words <i>grah</i> and <i>vibhasha</i> are understood here. By 'relation to commerce' is meant here the string of the balance; and not commerce in general. That string by which a balance is held is called तुलाप्रग्रहः or तुलाप्रग्राहः, as तुलाप्रग्राहेण चरति or तुलाप्रग्रहेण चरति; and this may be said of any person whether he be a trader or not.

Why do we say 'when belonging to commerce'? Observe प्रग्रहो देवदत्तस्य 'the whip of <i>Devadatta</i>'.
