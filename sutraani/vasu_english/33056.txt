The affix अच् comes after a root ending in इ or ई (when mere action is denoted or when the sense is that of an appellative, the word being related to the verb from which its name is deduced, but not as an agent).
The words within brackets are to be supplied from <i>sutras</i> 18 and 19: and these words are to be supplied in every subsequent <i>sutra</i> as far as <i>sutra</i> 113 of this chapter. This debars घञ्. The च in अच् is qualitative, in <i>sutras</i> like [[6.2.144]].

Thus, चयः 'collecting'; अयः 'going'; जयः 'victory'; क्षयः 'wasting'.

Vart:- In this connection the words भय &c. should also be enumerated. As भी + अच् = भयम् 'fear'; वर्षम् 'rain'. These being neuter words, otherwise would have taken the affix क्त &c. but for this <i>Vartika</i>.

Vart:- The words जव and सव are formed by this affix, and occur in the Vedas. As ऊर्वोरस्तु मे जयः, पञ्चोदनसवः । These roots जु and सु would have otherwise taken the affix अप्. The form would have been the same, but there would be difference of accent. See <i>Rig</i>. I.112.21, and <i>Yaj</i>. XI.2.
