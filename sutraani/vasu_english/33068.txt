The words प्रमद and सम्मद are irregularly formed, meaning 'joy'.
As कन्यानां प्रमदः 'the joy of girls'; कोकिलानां सम्मदः 'the rejoicing of cuckoos'.

Why do we say 'when meaning delight'? Observe प्रमादः 'carelessness'; सम्मादः 'frenzy'.

Instead of saying 'the verb <i>mad</i> preceded by <i>pra</i> and <i>sam</i> takes the affix <i>ap</i>' which also would have given the above forms, the full forms have been used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that these words are रूढि in this sense; for the sense of the root is not visible in these words.
