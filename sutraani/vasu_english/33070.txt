The word ग्लह is irregularly formed when the sense of the root refers to gambling.
This word is derived from the root ग्रह्. The verb ग्रह् takes the affix अप् and thus forms ग्रह्, and then irregularly र is changed into ल; as अक्षस्य ग्लहः 'cast of the dice'.

Why do we say 'when referring to gambling'? Observe ग्रहः पादस्य ।
 
Others say, this word is derived regularly from the root ग्लह् 'to gamble', by adding the affix अप्, and thus debarring घञ्. They suppose, therefore, the existence of the root ग्लह्, to explain the form ग्लहः । The counter-example which they would give, is ग्लाहः 'receiving', formed by adding the affix घञ् ।
