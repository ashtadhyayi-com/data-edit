The affix अप् comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when without an उपसर्ग , in the sense of mere action and वध is the substitute of हन् 'to kill' before this affix.
Thus वध has <i>udatta</i> accent on its final. The affix अप् which is <i>andatta</i> generally [[3.1.4]] thus becomes <i>udatta</i>.

As वधश्चोराणाम् 'the killing of thieves'; वधोदस्यूनाम् 'the killing of robbers'.

When action is not denoted, the affix घञ् applies; as घातः 'a blow'.

So also when an <i>upasarga</i> is in composition with it; as प्रघातः, घातः ।

The word च in the aphorism does not connect हन् with the substitute वध, there being no co-ordination, it refers to the affixes under discussion. Thus we have the affix घञ् also; as घातः 'killing'.
