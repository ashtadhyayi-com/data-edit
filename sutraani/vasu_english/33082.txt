The affix अप् comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when the words अयस् , वि or द्रु are in composition with it, when the word so formed is related to the verb as an instrument and घन् is the substitute.
As अयोघनः 'a forge-hammer' (whereby the iron is destroyed); विघनः 'a mallet'; द्रुघनः 'an axe'. Some write द्रुघणः, the न being changed into ण either by rule [[8.4.3]] or by including this word in the class of आरोहणादि [[4.2.80]].
