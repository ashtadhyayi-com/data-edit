The affix क also comes after a root हन् 'to kill' when स्तम्ब 'a clump' is the word in composition and the relation of the word so formed to the verb is that of the instrument.
The word च in the <i>sutra</i> draws in अप् from the last aphorism and in that case घन् replaces हन्. Thus स्तम्बघ्नः or स्तम्बघनः 'a small hoe for weeding clumps of grass'. In the feminine gender, the forms are स्तम्बघ्ना as well as स्तम्बघना । when क is added, we have स्तम्बघ्नः । Thus हन् + क + ह्न् + अ [[6.4.98]] = घ्न [[7.3.54]]. When अप् is added हन् is totally replaced by घन् । When instrument is not meant, we have स्तम्बघातः ।
