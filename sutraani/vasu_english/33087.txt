The word निघ is irregularly formed in the sense of 'as high as broad'.
The word निमित means 'measured all round' i.e. 'as high as broad'. As निघा वृक्षाः 'trees as high as broad'. निघा शालयः 'square or cubic or circular halls'. Otherwise, when not meaning 'as high as broad', we have निघातः 'a blow'. The word निमित = समन्तान्मितं, समारोहपरिणाहम् । It may be derived from मा or from मि । In the first case it will mean 'measured' and in the other, 'erected, built'. Professor Bothlingk refers to <i>Apastamba</i> <i>Dharma</i>. I.20.30 for the meaning of this word.
