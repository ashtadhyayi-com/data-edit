The affix कि comes after a घु verb -- दाधा घ्वदाप् [[1.1.20]] when a word in the Accusative -2nd case is in composition with it and when the relation of the word so formed to its verb, is that of 'location.
As जलधिः 'the ocean (in which water is held)';  शरधिः 'a quiver (that in which arrows are put)'.

The word 'location' in the aphorism indicates that the words so formed should have no other significance. The word च in the aphorism draws in the affix कि from the last <i>sutra</i>.
