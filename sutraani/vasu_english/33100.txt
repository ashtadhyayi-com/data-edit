And after the root कृ comes the affix श in forming a feminine as well as the affix क्यप्।
By the force of the word च we draw the affix क्यप् into this <i>sutra</i>, and by the process called योगविभाग we can split up this aphorism into two :-

(1) कृञः 'after the root कृ there is the affix क्तिन्'

(2) श च 'and the affix श as well as क्यप्'. Thus क्रिया, कृत्वा [[6.1.71]] and कृतिः । When the affix श is added, the root assumes the form क्रिय by [[3.1.67]].
