After the verbs that end in an affix, there is the affix अ, the word being feminine.
The verbs that end in an affix are derivative roots, such as Desideratives, Causatives, Intensives and Denominatives. Though taking affixes, they are called धातु [[3.1.32]], after these verbs the affix अ is used in forming the feminine noun.

Thus कृ + सन् = चिकीर्ष् 'to wish to do'; this is a Derivative root; after this root चिकीर्ष्, we add अ । Thus चिकीर्ष् + अ [[6.4.48]] = चिकीर्ष । Then we add टाप् by [[4.1.4]] and get चिकीर्षा 'the desire to do'; so also जिहीर्षा 'the desire to take'; पुत्रीया 'the desire to be like a son'; पुत्रकाम्या 'desire of a son'; लोलूया 'much cutting'; कण्डूया 'itch'. The <i>sutra</i> is also found as अः प्रत्ययात् ।
