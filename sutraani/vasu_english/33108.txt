The affix ण्वुल् comes diversely after verbs when the word to be formed is feminine noun, being the name of 'diseases'.
This debars क्तिन् and all the rest. By using the word आख्या in the <i>sutra</i> it is meant that the word so formed by this affix should be the appellation of the disease. The word 'diversely' shows the usual licence in the application of all the rules of grammar. Thus प्रच्छर्द्दिका [[7.1.1]] 'vomiting'; प्रवाहिका 'diarrhea'; विवर्चिका 'itch, scab'. Sometimes this affix does not apply; as शिरोर्त्तिः 'head-ache'.

Vart:- The affix <i>nvul</i> is employed also in simply pointing out the meaning of the roots; thus, आशिका 'to enjoy', शायिका 'lie down' &c.

Vart:- The affixes इक् and श्तिप् (that is शप् and तिप्) are also employed in merely pointing out the roots; as भिदिः, छिदिः, पचतिः &c. The constant use of these affixes is to be found in these very <i>sutras</i>. In the aphorisms the roots are exhibited in various ways; thus in <i>sutra</i> 49 of this chapter we have the root श्रि and यु exhibited as श्रयतिः and यौतिः । These latter forms indicating nothing more than the simple roots. So also, see [[8.4.17]]; [[6.4.49]].

Vart:- The affix कार is employed in merely pointing out letters; as ककारः means 'the letter क'; so also अकारः 'the letter अ'; इकारः 'the letter इ'.  

Vart:- The affix इफ is employed in pointing out the letter र; as रेफ ।

Vart:- The affix छ् comes after the word नत्वर्थ in merely pointing it out, and there is elision of the final अ; as मत्वर्थीयः ।

Vart:- The affix इञ् comes after the verbs  अज् & c; as आजिः, आतिः, आदिः ।

Vart:- The affix इक् comes after the verbs  कृष् & c; as, कृषिः, किरिः, &c.
