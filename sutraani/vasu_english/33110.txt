And the affix इञ् comes optionally after a root when a question and answer is expressed (as well as ण्वुल् and other affixes ordained by other rules).
The word परिप्रश्न means 'question' and आख्यान means 'answer'; in the <i>sutra</i>, in making the compound of these words, the logical sequence is not observed. The compound आख्यानपरिप्रश्न may, however, be justified on the ground that in a Compound a word consisting of smaller number of syllables should stand first [[2.2.34]] and hence <i>akhyana</i> is put first.

The force of च is to draw the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word ण्वुल् from the last into this. By the word 'optionally', it is meant that those affixes which would otherwise present themselves from the subsequent rules, should also be applied; thus: Q.—कां त्वं कारिमकार्षीः 'What work did you do'? A.—सर्वां कारिमकार्षम् 'I did all work'. Optionally we may have instead of कारि the following also. Q.—कां कारिकां, कृत्यां, कृतिं, क्रियां, अकार्षीः A.— सर्वां कारिकां or कृत्यां or कृतिं or क्रियां अकार्षम् । Similarly, Q.—कां गणिं (गणनां, गणिकां &c.) अजीगणः A.— सर्वाङ्गणिं &c. अजीगणम्. So also कां याजिम् or याजिकाम्; कां याचिम् or याचिकां &c.

Why do we say 'in question and answer'? Observe कृतिः and हृतिः ।
