The affixes called कृत्य -- कृत्याः प्राङ् ण्वुलः [[3.1.95]], and the affix ल्युट् , are diversely applicable and have other senses than those taught before.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the phrases 'when denoting action' and 'when the relation of the word formed to its parent verb is not that of an agent', which began with <i>sutras</i> [[3.3.18]] and [[3.3.19]], does not extend to this <i>sutra</i> or further. By saying 'diversely' we mean that they occur in other places than those where ordained by the rules. Thus the <i>kritya</i> affixes are ordained to come when 'act' or 'object' is to be expressed, but they come also when the <i>karaka</i> is other than the objective. Thus स्नानीयं चूर्णम् 'powder for bathing'; दानीयो ब्राह्मणः 'a <i>Brahmana</i> to whom a donation is to be made'. In the first of these examples the 'powder' is the 'instrument' expressible by the 3rd. case, and in the second the '<i>Brahmana</i>' is the recipient expressible by the fourth case; so that in both cases the affix is applied without any express rule.

Similarly, ल्युट् is ordained to come in denoting instrument, location, and a verbal noun [[3.3.115]] and [[3.3.117]]. But it is applied in other senses also. Thus राजभोजनाः शालयः 'halls for the eating of kings'; राजाच्छादनानि वासांसि 'dresses to be worn by the king'.

By using the word 'diversely', even the <i>krit</i> affixes are applied in places other than those expressly ordained. Thus, पादाभ्याम् ह्रियते = पादहारकः । गले चोप्यते = गलेचोपकः । For accent see [[6.2.150]].
