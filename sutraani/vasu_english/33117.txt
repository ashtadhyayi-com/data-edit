The affix ल्युट् is added to a root when the relation of the word so formed to the verb is that of an instrument or location.
Thus इध्मप्रव्रश्चनः 'an axe' (lit. an instrument for cutting wood); '<i>palasa</i>-cutter'; गोदोहनी 'milk-pail' (a vessel into which milk is milked); so also सक्तुधानी । In other words, this affix expresses also the idea of the instrumental case (a tool), and of the locative case (a repository).
