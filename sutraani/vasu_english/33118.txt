The affix घ generally comes in the sense of an instrument or location after a root, when the word to be formed is a name and is in the masculine gender.
The force of the word प्रायेण 'generally' is to show that this rule is not a universal rule. Thus दन्तच्छदः 'the lip'. छादि 'to cover' + घ [[6.4.96]] = छद lit. 'that by which the teeth are covered'; so also उरच्छद 'a breast plate'; घटः । These denote instruments.

So also in denoting 'location'. Thus आ + कृ + घ = आकरः 'a mine', so named because men work (<i>akurvanti</i>) in it, आलयः 'a house' that in which men settle down.

Why do we say 'in the masculine gender'? Observe प्रसाधनम् 'a comb'; (lit. that by which men decorate). Here the affix is <i>lyut</i>.

Why do we say 'when the complete word so formed is merely an appellative'? Observe प्रहरणो दण्डः 'the beating stick'.

The indicatory घ् is merely qualifying; for the application of <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.96]] by which after the causative छादि, when घ is added, the long आ is shortened.
