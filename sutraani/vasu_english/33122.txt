And the words 1. अध्याय 2. न्याय 3. उद्याव 4. संहार 5. आधारा 6. आवयाः are anomalous.
These words are formed by adding the affix घञ् to the exclusion of घ which would have come by rule [[3.3.118]]. All these words are derived from roots which end in vowels. Thus अधि + इ + घञ् = अध्यायः 'a chapter or book' (lit. that in which they read); नी--न्यायः 'logic, justice', (lit. that by which men are lead); उत्-यु--उद्यावः 'mixture' (lit. that in which they blend); सम्-हृ--संहारः 'destruction' (lit. by which they are destroyed); आ-धृ-आधारः 'support' (lit. in which anything is held); आ-वि--आवायः = आवयन्ति अस्मिन् ।

The force of च is to include others not enumerated above; as, अवहारः ।
