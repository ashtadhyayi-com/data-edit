The affix युच् comes after the roots ending in long आ (when ईषद् and दुर् and सु are combined as उपपद-sūtras, in the sense of easily or with difficulty).
The word ईषद् &c. are to be read into this <i>sutra</i>, not so the words कर्तृकर्मणा &c. This supersedes the affix खल्. Thus ईषत्पानः सोमो भवता 'the <i>soma</i> juice can be lightly drunk by you'; दुष्पानः 'difficult to be drunk'; सुपानः 'easy to be drunk'. ईषद्दानो गौर्भवता 'the cow can be given with ease by you'; दुर्दानः सुदानः &c.
