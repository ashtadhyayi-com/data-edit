The affix of the Potential is used in denoting Futurity after a root, when the उपपद in composition with it is a word expressing 'hope'.
This is also an <i>apavada</i> of rule [[3.3.132]], and teaches the employment of the Potential with a future force. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छेद्, आशंसेयुक्तोऽधीयीय 'if the teacher will come, I hope, you will study with diligence'. This being a subsequent rule, will apply even when the words expressive of 'quickness' are in composition. Thus आशंसे क्षिप्रमधीयीय 'I hope, you will learn soon'. So also, अवकल्पये युक्तोऽधीयीय, &c.
