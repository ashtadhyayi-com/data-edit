When constant continuance of action or a near Past or Future is meant, the Past and Future are not denoted as taught in अनद्यतने लङ् [[3.2.111]] and अनद्यतने लुट् [[3.3.15]], through the Imperfect and the II Future, but through the Aorist and the First Future.
The affixes लङ् (Imperfect Past) and लुट् (First Future), have been ordained to come, when past time not belonging to the current day, and future time not belonging to the current day, are respectively indicated. The present <i>sutra</i> prohibits these two affixes. The word क्रियाप्रबन्धः means 'performing an action with continuity'; and सामीप्य means 'not remoteness of time, immediateness, without the intervention of anything of the same genus'. Thus यावज्जीवं भृशमन्नमदात् (not अददात्) 'he gave food throughout his life'; or भृशमन्नं दास्यति 'he will give much food'. यावज्जीवं पुत्रोप्यापिपत् 'throughout his life he taught', or यावज्जीवमध्यापयिष्यति  'throughout his life he will teach'. In both these cases the Aorist and the Second Future are used instead of the Imperfect and the First Future.

So also when recent past or immediate future is meant, the Aorist and the Second Future are employed, instead of the Imperfect and the First Future. Thus येयं पौर्णमास्यतिक्रान्ता, एतस्यामुपाध्यायोग्नीनाधित or सोमेनायष्ठ or गामदित 'during the full-moon that has just past, the teacher consecrated the fire, or performed the <i>soma</i>-sacrifice or gave a cow'. Here the Aorist is for the Imperfect. येयममावास्याऽऽगामिनी, एतस्यामुपाध्यायोग्नीनाधास्यते or सोमेन यक्ष्यते, or स गां दास्यते 'on the next new-moon day, the teacher will perform the fire-sacrifice or the <i>soma</i>-sacrifice, or he will give a cow'. Here the Second Future is employed instead of the First Future.

The double negative न अनद्यतन 'not non-today' implies the proper corresponding tenses which indicate <i>adyatana</i>.
