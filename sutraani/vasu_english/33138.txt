Optionally so, when a declaration is made with regard to that side of a limit of time.
The whole of the last aphorism must be read into this: The <i>sutra</i> will then stand thus: "The Second and the First Futures are optionally both employed in denoting future time, not belonging to the current day, instead of the First Future alone, when the word पर is used signifying a limit of time on that side of a fixed period, provided that this word does not give the sense of day or night".

This rule allows an option when the time refers to the पर side of a starting limit. Thus योऽयं संवत्सर आगामी तस्य यत् परमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्येष्यामहे or अध्येतास्महे 'we will read together in the month of <i>Chaitra</i>, the year after next'.

All the counter-examples given under the last aphorism, are also valid here by substituting the word पर instead of अवर.
