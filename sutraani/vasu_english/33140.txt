And (where there is a reason for affixing लिङ् (Benedictive) , the affix ऌङ् (Conditional Future) is to be used, when the non-completion of the action is to be understood) if the sense is that of past time.
The whole of the last aphorism is understood in this. The last <i>sutra</i> enjoined लृङ् in the Future tense; this <i>sutra</i> ordains it in the Past, the Conditional tense having both these significations. The reasons for affixing लिङ् are given in <i>sutras</i> [[3.3.152]] and those that follow it. In <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.141]] and those that follow, as far as [[3.3.152]], optional rules for the employment of the Conditional tense will be given. Thus:- दृष्टो मया भवत्पुत्रोऽन्नार्थी चङ्क्रम्यमाणः अपरश्च द्विजो ब्राह्मणार्थी, यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत्, तदाऽभोक्ष्यत, न तु भुक्तवान्, अन्येन पथा स गतः । 'I saw your son, wandering about in search of food, I saw also a twice-born in search of a <i>Brahmana</i>(whom he would feast); if he (your son) had been seen by him (the twice-born), then he would have been fed; but as a matter of fact, he has not been fed, he went by a different road'.

The conditional sentence यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत् तदाऽभोक्ष्यत is employed under circumstances set out above. It refers to a past time, there is the relation of cause and effect existing, one being in search of food, and another in search of a guest to feed; and the action is not completed; both taking different roads, did not come across each other.
