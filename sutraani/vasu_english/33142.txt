The affix लट् (Present Tense) is used after a root when it has in composition with it the wordsअपि or जातु , the sense implied by the sentence being that of 'censure'.
The word गर्हा means 'censure', 'blame'. The affix लट् has been enjoined to come with a present signification, and would not have come to denote time in general, which, however, it does here, for here the Present tense is employed in preference to the tense required by the time of the action, which is totally excluded. Hence the present <i>sutra</i>.

Thus अपि तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयति 'even your honor sacrifices (or sacrificed or will sacrifice) to a <i>Sudra</i>'; जातु तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयति गर्हामहे, अहोअन्याय्यमेतत् 'possibly your honor sacrifices for a <i>Sudra</i>'; the sense implied being that such conduct on the part of those men are blameworthy.

In the present case, there being no occasion for the application of लिङ्, of course, we cannot employ लृङ् to denote the non-completion of the action.
 
So also अपि or जातु जायां त्यजसि ' Fie! you abandon (or abandoned or will abandon) your wife'!
