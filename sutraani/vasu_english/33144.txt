The affixes लिङ् (Benedictive) and लृट् (I Future) come after a verb when the interrogative words like किम् etc. are in composition with it and censure is implied.
Here also the Potential and the First Future are employed in preference to the time required by the action.

The word 'censure' is understood here; not so, however, the word 'optionally'. This excludes all other tense-affixes. The repetition of the word लिङ् in this <i>sutra</i>, is for the sake of excluding लट्, whose <i>anuvritti</i> would also have run into this <i>sutra</i>, had we taken the <i>anuvritti</i> of लिङ् from the last <i>sutra</i>, instead of repeating it. Thus कः कतरो वा हरिं निन्देत्, निन्दिष्यति वा 'who will censure <i>Hari</i>'?

In the Past tense, when the non-completion of action is implied, we may optionally employ the Conditional (लृङ्); and in the Future tense, under similar circumstances, we must employ the Conditional necessarily; as को नाम वृषलो यं तत्र भवानयाजयिष्यत् 'who is the <i>Sudra</i> for whom your honor did sacrifice (in vain)'. This <i>sutra</i> may be rendered thus also:—" In connection with an Interrogative Pronoun, when censure is implied, may be employed the Potential or the First Future".
