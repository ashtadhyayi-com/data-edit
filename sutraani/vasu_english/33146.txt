The affix लृट् (I Future) is used after a root when the words किंकिल or those having the sense of अस्ति 'he is' are in construction with it (when the action is not likely to occur, or is not to be tolerated).
The words within brackets must be supplied from the last aphorism. The whole word किङ्किल is to be taken as an <i>upapada</i> and not the word किं and किल separately. This word expresses anger. The words having the sense of <i>asti</i> are अस्ति, भवति and विद्यते । This rule supersedes the Potential (लिङ्). Thus किङ्किल or अस्ति or भवति or विद्यते नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयिष्यति, न मर्षयामि, न श्रद्दधे 'Is it possible that your honor will (or did or does) sacrifice for a <i>Sudra</i> ? I cannot believe or tolerate it'.

As there is no occasion for लिङ् here, we cannot have the Conditional (लृङ्) required by rule [[3.3.141]].

Another example is न श्रद्दधे न मर्षये वा किङ्किल त्वं शूद्रान्नम् भोक्ष्यसे 'I do not believe or can tolerate that thou shouldst eat the food of <i>Sudra</i>'; अस्ति भवति विद्यते वा शूद्रीं गमिष्यसि 'Is it possible that thou shouldst go to a female <i>Sudra</i>'.
