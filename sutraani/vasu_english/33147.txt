The affix लिङ् (Benedictive) comes after a root, the words जातु and यत् being in construction with it, when the sense is that the action is not believed to be likely or is not to be tolerated.
This excludes the First Future or '<i>Lrit</i>'. जातु तन्न भवान् वृषलम् याजयेत्, or यन्नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलम् याजयेत्, न श्रद्दधे, न मर्षयामि ।

Vart:- The words यदा and यदि should be enumerated along with the words जातु and यत् in this rule. As यदि or यदि वा त्वादृशो हरिं निन्देन्नावकल्पयामि न मर्षयामि 'neither do I think, nor do I tolerate that one like you should blaspheme <i>Hari</i>'.

Here also when the non-completion of the action is implied, the Conditional (लृङ्) is necessarily employed in denoting future time, and optionally so in denoting past time. As जातु, यत्, यदा or यदि त्वादृशो हरिं निन्देत् or अनिन्दिष्यन् नावकल्पयामि, न मर्षयामि वा 'neither do I believe, nor do I tolerate that one like you did attempt to blaspheme <i>Hari</i>'. यदि सुरभिमवाप्स्यस्तन्मुखोच्छ्वासगन्धम् तव रति रभविष्यत् पुण्डरीके किमस्मिन् 'if you had felt (which you clearly have not) the fragrant smell of her breath, would you have had any liking for this lotus'?
