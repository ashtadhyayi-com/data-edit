The affix लिङ् (Benedictive) (as well as कृत्य and लोट् (Imperative) ) is used (under similar circumstances in the sense of 1. direction 2. permission etc.) when the time is future by a मुहूर्त (48 minutes or an Indian hour); (or the Potential may be used as well when it signifies 'at this very moment').
The words प्रैष &c. of the last <i>sutra</i> must be read into this. The force of च is to introduce the words कृत्या and लोट् from the last <i>sutra</i>, into this. Thus ऊर्ध्वं मुहूर्त्तादुपरि मुहूर्तस्य भवता खलु कठः कर्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः, or भवान् खलु कटं कुर्यात (Potential) or करोतु (Imperative). 'You may make the mat after an Indian hour'; or 'you must &c', or 'it is proper time for you to make a mat just now'. Compare [[3.3.9]].
