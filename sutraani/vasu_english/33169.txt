The affixes कृत्य and the affix तृच are added to a root when fitness as regards the agent is implied (as well as in the affix लिङ् (Benedictive) ).
The force of च is to introduce the Potential (लिङ्) into this, from the last. Thus भवता खलु कन्या वोढव्या वाह्या or वहनीया, (<i>kritya</i>); or भवान् खलु कन्यया वोढा (<i>trich</i>); or भवान् खलु कन्यां वहेत् (<i>lin</i>) 'your honor is fit to marry the girl'.

Why specifically enjoin '<i>kritya</i>' and '<i>trich</i>' in the sense of fitness? They being enjoined universally, would a fortiori, be applied when fitness is to be denoted ? Because the लिङ् being specially enjoined to denote fitness, and being an <i>Apavada</i>, would have debarred <i>kritya</i> and <i>trich</i>, which being universal affixes, would give way. Nor can we, to prevent this contingency, take shelter under rule [[3.1.94]] of 'non-uniform affixes', for we have seen that that rule is not universally valid.
