The affixes called कृत्य also come after a root when the sense to be indicated is that of 'necessity' or 'obligation'.
Thus भवता खलु अवश्यं कटः कर्त्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः or कृत्यः 'you ought to make the mat'; भवता शतं दातव्यं, देयं, &c, 'you ought to pay a hundred'.

Q.-- Where is the necessity of this aphorism ? The <i>kritya</i> affixes, being enjoined universally without any limitation would, of course, come under these special circumstances also.

A.-- They would be excluded by the special affix णिनि of the last <i>sutra</i>, which comes especially with the force of 'necessity' and 'obligation'.

Q.-- Not so, for णिनि comes in denoting the 'agent' (कर्ता), while <i>kritya</i> denotes the 'action' (भाव) and the 'object' (कर्म); so their scope being different, how can one supersede the other ?

A.-- Well, to remove this objection, some say, that <i>kritya</i> words like भव्य, गेय &c. [[3.4.68]] which especially refer to the agent, are the proper examples to be given under this aphorism; and not examples of <i>kritya</i>-formed words in general.
