The affixes क्तिच् and क्त are used after a root when benediction is intended, provided that the whole word so formed is an appellative.
The affixes therefore, 'give the sense of the agent, with the addition that the action is simply the object of a prayer of some one who wishes that that may be the action of that agent, the sense being simply appellative'. Thus तन्तिः = तनुतात् 'a weaver' (lit. may he weave); सातिः or सतिः = सनुतात् [[6.4.45]] 'wealth or gift'; भूतिः = भवतात् 'success'; मन्मिः = मनुतात् 'respect'. These are examples of words formed by the affix क्तिच् । Of words formed by क्त in this sense, we have देवदत्तः = देवा एनं देयासुः <i>Devadatta</i> (lit. may the Gods give him). Though the affix क्त has already once been generally ordained, its repetition here is to prevent its being superseded by क्तिच् । The च् of क्तिच् is qualifying only, distinguishing it from क्तिन् &c. and is useful in <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.39]].
