In the first case -- क्रियासमभिहारे लोट्, लोटो हिस्वौ, वा च तध्वमोः [[3.4.2]] the same verb must be used in the subsequent clause, as the verb which was put in the लोट् (Imperative Mood) .
The examples have already been given under <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.2]]. We cannot say लूनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं छिनत्ति; we must use a verb from the root लू 'to cut'. Such as लुनाति, &c. So also अधीष्वाधीष्व takes अधोते only after it and not a synonymous verb like पठति &c.
