According to the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians, the affix क्त्वा comes after the verb, when there are in combination with it, the words अलम् and खलु expressing the sense of prohibition.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words 'in the Vedas &c' does not extend further. Thus अलं कृत्वा 'do not make'; खलु पीत्वा 'do not drink'; अलं काले रुदित्या 'do not weep, O girl !

Why do we say 'when there are अलं and खलु'? Witness माकार्षीः 'do not make'. Why do we say 'when expressing prohibition'? Observe अलङ्कारः 'decoration'.
 
The phrase 'in the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians' shows that it is an optional rule. Therefore we have अलंरोदनेन 'do not weep'. Or if rule [[3.1.94]] be applied, then the use of the word प्राचां is for the sake of merely showing respect (<i>pujartha</i>); the rule could have stood without it.
