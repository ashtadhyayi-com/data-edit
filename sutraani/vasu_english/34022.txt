The affixes णमुल् and क्त्वा come after a root when reiteration is to be expressed.
The phrases 'when the agent of both the verbs is the same' and 'after the verb whose action occurs first in time' are to be read into this <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense. The force of च is to introduce the affix क्त्वा into this <i>sutra</i>. The affixes <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i> express 're-iteration' then only when the verb is doubled, and not singly. See rule [[8.1.4]]. Thus भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'having eaten repeatedly, he goes'; similarly भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति, पायं पायं व्रजति 'having drunk repeatedly he goes'.
