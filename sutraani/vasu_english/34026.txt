(When the actions signified by the verbs कृ 'to make' and another have the same agent), the affix णमुल् is added to the verb कृ 'to make' which is concerned about a time anterior to that of the other), provided that a word signifying 'sweet' is in composition.
The words within brackets are to be read into the <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from [[3.4.21]]. Thus स्वादुङ्कारं or लक्षणङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having made his food sweet or seasoned'.

In the <i>sutra</i>, the word स्वादुम् is used ending with म्. It is an anomalous form, and indicates that a म् must be added to the <i>upapadas</i> in these cases the object served by this form being that rule [[4.1.44]], by which feminine of words like स्वादु ending in उ is formed by long ई, does not apply here. Thus स्वाद्वीम् कृत्वा यवागूम् भुङ्क्ते = स्वादुङ्कारं यवागूम् भुङ्क्ते । Here though यवागू is feminine, the attribute is still स्वादुं and not स्वाद्वीं ।

It might be said 'why not use the previous affix खमुञ्? That will solve all difficulties; and will give us the augment मुम् । To this, however, there is a fatal objection. The augment मुम् will, no doubt, come in the last example, but it will not come when the word to be formed is an Indeclinable [[6.3.67]], such as, when the sense is of the affix च्वि and all <i>chvi</i>-ending words are Indeclinables [[1.4.61]]. Therefore, the affix खमुञ् will not remove the difficulty in the following case; अस्वाद्वीं स्वाद्वों कृत्वा भुङ्क्ते = स्वादुङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having first sweetened what was not sweet before'.

By applying rule [[3.1.94]], we have the affix क्त्वा in the alternative. Thus स्वादु कृत्वा भुङ्क्तं । All these affixes form abstract nouns (भाव) as they have the sense of the affix तुमुन् [[3.4.16]]. In connection with णमुल्, the Instrumental case can not, however, be used, i. e. we cannot use the Passive construction; e.g. स्वादुङ्कारं यवागूर्भुज्यते देवदत्तेन will be wrong.
