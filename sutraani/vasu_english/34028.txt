The affix णमुल् is added to the root कृ 'to make', the words 1. यथा 2. तथा being compounded with it when an angry reply is made (if the omission of कृञ् is unobjectionable).
When one questions or replies in indignation, displeasure or anger, then is this construction valid. Thus तथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन 'l will eat in that way; what is that to you'? Similarly यथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन ।

Why do we say 'when an angry reply is made'? Observe यथाकृत्वाऽहं भोक्ष्ये तथा त्वं द्रक्ष्यसि 'in what way I will eat, that thou wilt see'.

Why do we say 'when the omission of कृञ् would be valid'? Witness यथाकृत्वाऽहं शिरो भोक्ष्ये किं तवानेन 'what is that to you, in what way turning my head I will eat'?
