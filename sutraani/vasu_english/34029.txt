When the object is compounded with it, the verb दृश् 'to see' or विद् 'to know' takes the affix णमुल् to denote the total number of such objects.
Thus कन्यादर्शं वरयति 'he woos every girl that he sees i.e. all the girls seen'. ब्राह्मणवेदं भोजयति 'he feeds as many <i>Brahmanas</i> as he knows, i.e. all'.

Why do we say 'when denoting the total number of such objects'? Observe ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा भोजयति 'having seen the <i>Brahmana</i> he feeds him'.
