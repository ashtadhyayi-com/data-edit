The affix णमुल् comes after the causative of the root क्नूय् 'to wet', when there is compounded with a noun denoting 'clothing', in the Accusative -2nd case, as an उपपद , if the whole word so formed expresses a measure of the rainfall.
The verb क्नोपि is the causative root formed from the simple root क्नूय् 'to wet'. Thus चेलक्नोपं वृष्टो देवः or वस्त्रक्नोपं or वसनक्नोपं &c. 'it rained so as to wet the clothes'.
