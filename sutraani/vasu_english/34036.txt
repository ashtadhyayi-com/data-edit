The affix णमुल् comes after the verbs 1. हन् 'to kill' 2. कृ 'to make' 3. ग्रह् 'to seize', when the words 1. समूल 2. आकृत 3. जीव in the Accusative -2nd case are respectively compounded with them.
Thus समूलघातं हन्ति [[8.3.32]] and [[8.3.54]] 'he destroys so as to tear up by the roots i.e. he totally extirpates'; अकृतकारं करोति 'he does a thing which was not done before'; तं जीवग्राहं गृह्णाति 'captures him so as to preserve his life, i. e. captures him alive'. Here also appropriate verbs from the same roots are used to govern the gerund.
