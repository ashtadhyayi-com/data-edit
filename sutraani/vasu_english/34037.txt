The affix णमुल् comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when a word in the Instrumental -3rd case is in composition with it.
Thus पाणिघातं वेदिं हन्ति [[7.3.32]] and [[7.3.54]] = पाणिना वेदिं हन्ति 'the strikes the <i>Vedi</i> with the hand'; पादघातं भूमिं हन्ति 'he strikes the ground with the foot'. Reading this <i>sutra</i> along with [[3.4.48]], we find that हन् here does not mean 'to kill', and the further difference between this aphorism and that is, that in the case of this <i>sutra</i> a cognate verb from the same root must be used, as the gerund; not so in <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.48]]; or this <i>sutra</i> may be for the sake of forming Invariable compounds with the <i>upapadas</i>, such as पादघातं ।

According to <i>Patanjali</i>, this affix comes after हन् under this aphorism, even when हन् means 'to injure'; thus counteracting rule [[3.4.48]], by anticipation, and in opposition to the general principle of interpretation enunciated in rule [[1.4.2]]. Thus असिघातं हन्ति 'he kills with the sword'; शरघातं हन्ति 'he kills with arrows'.

Rule [[3.4.46]] applies here also, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.
