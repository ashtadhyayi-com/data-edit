The affix णमुल् comes after the verb पिष् 'to grind' when a word in the Instrumental -3rd case denoting 'liquid' is in composition.
Thus उदपेषं पिनष्टि = उदकेन पिनष्ठि [[6.3.58]] 'he grinds with water'; तैलपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds with oil'. Here also [[3.4.46]] applies, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.
