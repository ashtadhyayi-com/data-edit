The affix णमुल् comes after the बन्ध् 'to bind' when a word expressing location is in construction with it.
Of course, rule [[3.4.46]] applies here also, and the gerund must be governed by a verb from the same root <i>bandh</i>. Thus चक्रबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds to the wheel'; कूटबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in a snare'; मुष्टिबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in the fist'. चोरकबन्धं बध्नाति = चोरके बध्नाति ।
