The affix णमुल् comes after the roots नश् 'to destroy' and वह् 'to carry' when the words जीव 'life' and पुरुष 'person' expressing the agent of these verbs, are respectively in construction with them.
Thus जीवनाशं नश्यति = जीवो नश्यति 'perishes, so that his life perishes i.e. dies away'; पुरुषवाहं वहति 'the man carries, i.e. the man becoming a servant, carries another on him = पुरुषः प्रेष्यो भूत्वा वहन्ति ।

Why do we say 'when denoting an agent'? Observe, जीवेन नष्टः 'destroyed by life'; पुरुषेणोढः 'carried by a man'.
