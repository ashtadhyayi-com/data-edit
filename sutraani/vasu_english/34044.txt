The affix णमुल् comes after the roots शुष् 'to dry' and पूर् 'to fill' when the word ऊर्ध्व denoting an agent is in composition with them.
Thus ऊर्ध्वशोषं शुष्यति वृक्षः = ऊर्ध्वे शुष्यति 'the tree is dried up while it is still standing'. Compare यद्वोर्ध्वशोषतृणवद्विशुष्कः 'or wither like the up-heaved grass drying up' (<i>Bhatti</i>. III.14); ऊर्ध्वपूरं पूर्यते 'is filled full to the brim'. Rule [[3.4.46]] applies here also.
