The same verb should be used after the gerunds formed from the verbs कष् 'to rub' etc. as the verb from which the gerund is derived.
From <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.34]] up to <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.45]], a verb from the same root must be employed in the subsequent part, as <i>anuprayoga</i>, from which the gerund in <i>namul</i> was formed. This rule has been illustrated in the examples under the previous aphorisms.

The present is a restrictive or <i>niyama</i> rule. This chapter deals with affixes employed in denoting syntactical relation between two verbs (धातुसम्बन्धे प्रत्ययाः)। See [[3.4.1]] : so a gerund in <i>namul</i>, would, of course, be followed by some verb as <i>anuprayoga</i>; the present <i>sutra</i> declares that the other verb must be from the same root as the gerund.
