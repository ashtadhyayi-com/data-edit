The affix णमुल् comes after a root when a word in the Accusative -2nd case denoting a limb of one's own body, which is completely afflicted by the action, is in composition.
The word परिक्लिश्यमान means 'completely hurt or affected'. Thus उरः प्रतिपेषं or उरःपेषं युध्यन्ते = कृत्स्नमुरः पीडयन्तः 'they fight so as to afflict their whole bosom'. So also शिरःपेषं or शिरःप्रतिपेषं ।

The difference between this and the last <i>sutra</i> consists in this, that this <i>sutra</i> applies even to vital organs, such as 'breast', 'head' &c; while the last aphorism applies 'non-vital organs' only.
