The affixes क्तवा and णमुल् are added to the roots भू 'to be', when the word तूष्णीम् 'silently' is in composition.
Thus तूष्णीम्भूय, तूष्णीं भूत्वा, or तूष्णीम्भावम् 'having become silent'. The repetition of भू in this <i>sutra</i>, shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of कृ does not run into it and altogether ceases.
