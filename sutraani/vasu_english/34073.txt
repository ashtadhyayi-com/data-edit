The word दाश and गोघ्न are irregularly formed and the affix in these denotes the idea of the Dative or Recipient.
The word दाश comes from the root दाशृ 'to give' by adding  affix अच् under rule [[3.1.134]]. This being a कृदन्त word would have otherwise denoted the agent by rule [[3.4.67]] of this chapter. The present <i>sutra</i> makes it denote the recipient or have the force of the dative case. Thus दाश means 'to whom something is given i. e. a servant'. Similarly <i>goghna</i> does not mean 'the killer of cow' but 'he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest'. It is this irregularly-formed word <i>goghna</i> which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law &c, and not the regularly-formed word <i>goghna</i> which means 'a killer of cow' or a '<i>Chandal</i>'. Thus दाशः = दाशन्ति तस्मै; गोघ्नः = तस्मै दातुं गां घ्नन्ति ॥
