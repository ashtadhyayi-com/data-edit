The words formed by उणादि affixes denote other ideas other than these two - 1. Reciepient 2. Ablation.
The <i>Unadi</i> affixes being a subdivision of <i>krit</i> affixes, would have, by rule [[3.4.67]], denoted the agent. By the present <i>sutra</i> they are made to denote the object, the instrument and the location also. The word ताभ्यां has been used in the <i>sutra</i> in order to include the word <i>sampradana</i> also. For, had the <i>sutra</i> been अन्यत्रोणादयः, only the <i>Apadana</i> <i>karaka</i> would have been excluded, as being the nearest; but not so the <i>Sampradana</i> <i>karaka</i>. Thus कृषितोऽसौ = कृषिः (<i>Un</i>. IV. 120) 'agriculture i.e. what is ploughed' (object); तन्यत इति = तन्तुः (<i>Un</i>. 1.69) 'a thread i.e. what is drawn out'; वृत्तमिति वर्त्म (<i>Un</i>. IV. 145) 'a way i.e. what is established'; चरितं = चर्म (<i>Un</i>. IV. 145) 'skin' (in which they live).
