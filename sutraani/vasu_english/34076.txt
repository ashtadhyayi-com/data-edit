The affix क्त which is ordained after roots denoting fixedness (to cling to a place), motion and taking gives the sense of location as well.
The verbs denoting ध्रौव्य or 'persisting in a place' are Intransitive verbs. The word <i>pratyavasana</i> means 'eating' also; the force of च in the <i>sutra</i> is that the affix <i>kta</i> expresses other relations also. Thus after verbs denoting 'fixedness' or <i>dhrauvyartha</i> it denotes the agent, the act and the location; after verbs denoting 'motion' it gives the sense of agent, object, act and location; after verbs denoting 'taking or eating', it has the sense of object, act and location. Thus आसितो देवदत्तः '<i>Devadatta</i> sat'; आसितं तेन 'sitting by him' (act); इदमेषामासितम् 'this was their seat' (location); यातो देवदत्तो ग्रामम् '<i>Devadatta</i> went to the village' (active); यातो देवदत्तेन ग्रामः (passive); यातं देवदत्तेन (abstract); इदमेषां यातम् 'this is their place of going' (location); भुक्त ओदनो देवदत्तेन (passive); भुक्त ओदनं देवदत्तः (active); देवदत्तेन भुक्तम् (abstract); इदमेषां भुक्तम् (location); कथं भुक्ता ब्राह्मणाः । पीता गावः । The आ in भुक्ता and पीता has the force of मतुप् [[4.2.85]]. भुक्तमेषामस्ति or पीतमेषामस्ति ।
