In the लोट् (Imperative Mood) उ is the substitute of इ।
Thus ति becomes तु, अन्ति becomes अन्तु, as have already been given in the above table.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of affixes हि and नि of लोट् । In the case of these two affixes, the इ is not changed into उ, either because they have been so taught in the <i>sutras</i>, or because the वा of <i>sutra</i> [[3.4.83]] is understood here also and makes this rule an optional rule of limited scope as in the last <i>sutra</i> (व्यवस्थित विभाषा). Thus पचतु, पचन्तु ।

In fact, this <i>sutra</i> is confined to ति and झि only and does not apply to सि to which the next <i>sutra</i> applies.
