In the लोट् (Imperative Mood) , हि is substituted for सि and this has not the indicatory प् of सिप् , i.e. it is acutely accented.
The substitute being like the original expression (1.1. 56), हि substituted for सिप्, would have been a पित् affix, but for this <i>sutra</i>, which clearly states in its latter portion that this हि is not to be regarded as having an indicatory प ।

Thus लुनीहि, पुनीहि, राध्नुहि, तक्ष्णुहि; and as this affix is अपित्, rule (1.2. 4) makes it ङित् also, and thereby no <i>guna</i> takes place.
