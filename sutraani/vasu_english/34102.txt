The तिङ् (Personal Endings) of the लिङ् (Benedictive) and the Potential take the augment स्युत् ।
The ट् of सीयुट् is indicatory and shows that this augment is to be placed before the affixes [[1.1.46]]. The उ is for the sake of pronunciation; this rule applies to the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes. In the Potential, the स् of this augment is elided by [[7.2.79]], and the य् also, before a personal-ending beginning with a consonant, is dropped according to [[6.1.66]]. In this way, we have पचेत, पचेयाताम्, and by [[3.4.105]], पचेरन् । In the Benedictive, the augment retains its full form, only so far as it is not governed by [[6.1.66]]. Thus पक्षीट, पक्षीयास्ताम् पक्षीरन् ।
