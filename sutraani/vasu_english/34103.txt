When the परस्मैपद affixes of the Potential follow, then यासुट् acutely accented, is their augment and the termination is regarded as having an indicatory ङ्।
This debars सीयुट्; the उट् of यासुट् is indicatory; the real augment is यास्. All augments being <i>anudatta</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> therefore especially uses the word <i>udatta</i> to show that this augment is an exception to the general rule. Though लिङ् has an indicatory ङ्, and therefore by the rule [[1.1.56]], its substitutes would also be regarded as having an indicatory ङ्, the repetition of the word ङित् in this <i>sutra</i> shows the existence of the <i>paribhasha</i> "that the ङ् belonging to ल does not influence its substitutes;" in other words, the substitutes of लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ् and लृङ् are not to be regarded as having an indicatory ङ् (लकाराश्रयङित्वमादेशानां न भवति). In the Potential, the स् of यासुट् is elided by [[7.2.79]]. So we get the forms कुर्यात्, कुर्याताम्, and by applying [[3.4.108]] and [[6.1.96]], कुर्युस् । For the Benedictive लिङ् the following <i>sutra</i> applies.
