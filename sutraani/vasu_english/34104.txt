The augment यासुट् comes after that लिङ् (Benedictive) also which denotes benediction and it is acutely accented and the substitutes of this लिङ् (Benedictive) are as they had an indicatory क्।
The कित् of this <i>sutra</i> refers to the personal affixes of the Benedictive mood and not to the augment यासुट्, for that would have been unnecessary, being already ङित् by the last rule. ङित् and कित् are equal in prohibiting <i>guna</i> and <i>vriddhi</i>, but ङित् is distinguished from कित् in as much as ङित् causes the <i>guna</i> of जागृ [[7.3.85]], and also there is distinction between them with regard to the change of semi-vowel to vowel [[6.1.15]] and [[6.1.16]]. Thus इष्यात्, इष्यास्ताम्, इष्यासुः, and जागर्यात्, जागर्यास्ताम् and जागर्यासुः । In the Potential, वच्यात् (no <i>samprasarana</i>); in the Benedictive, उच्यात् (vocalisation). So also जागृयात् in the Potential.
