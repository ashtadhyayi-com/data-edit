The augment सुट् is added to the following affixes त and थ when part of the affixes of the Potential and Benedictive.
The letters त and थ are the objects to which the augment सुट् is to be added; provided that the त and थ are the initial of the affixes employed in लिङ् ।

The augment सीयुट् is applied to लिङ् as such; in other words, लिङ् is there the आगमी; but in the case of सुट्, लिङ् is not आगमी, but त and थ are the आगमी । The scope of सीयुट् and सुट् being thus different, one does not debar the other.

In the <i>sutra</i>, the word ति is used; the इ of ति is merely for the sake of pronunciation. Thus कृषीट, कृषीयास्ताम् कृषीरन्, कृषीष्ठाः, कृषीयास्थाम् । In the Potential, the स् is elided by [[7.2.79]].
