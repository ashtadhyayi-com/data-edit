The तिङ् (Personal Endings) of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) are also called आर्द्धधातुक ।
This debars them from being called <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and, being <i>ardhadhatuka</i>, some of them take the augment इट्; as पेचिथ, शेकिथ । Moreover by their being <i>ardhadhatuka</i> they do not admit of the <i>Vikaranas</i> शप् &c.

So from ग्लै (ग्ला, VI.1.45) we have जग्ले; here the आ is elided by [[6.4.64]], the affix being treated as <i>ardhadhatuka</i>; similarly मम्ले from म्लै ।
