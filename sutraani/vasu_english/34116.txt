When the sense is that of Benediction, the substitutes of लिङ् (Benedictive) are called आर्द्धधातुक i.e. the तिङ् (Personal Endings) of the लिङ् (Benedictive) are आर्द्धधातुक ।
This debars these affixes from being called <i>sarvadhatuka</i>. Being <i>ardhadhatuka</i> they take the augment इट्, and before these affixes the root does not take the <i>Vikaranas</i> शप् &c. Thus from the root लू 'to cut', we have in the आशीर्लिङ्, लविसीष्ट; and from the root पू 'to purify', पविषीष्ट. But in the विधिलिङ् (Potential), we have the proper <i>Vikaranas</i> &c. as लुनीयात्, पुनीयात् ।
