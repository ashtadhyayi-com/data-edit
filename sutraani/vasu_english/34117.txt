In the छन्दस् (Vedas) this distinction of सार्वधातुक and आर्द्धधातुक is not always maintained and the affixes are promiscuously used.
In the Vedas, there is no hard and fast rule about <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and  <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes. Sometimes the तिङ् and शित् are treated as if they were <i>ardhadhatuka</i>. Thus वर्धन्तु त्वा सुष्टुतयः । Here the affixes of the लोट् are treated as <i>ardhadhatuka</i> and consequently there is the elision of the णिच् by rule [[6.4.51]]; the proper form of this word would be वर्धयन्तु । Sometimes ardhadhatuka<i> affixes are treated like </i>sarvadhatuka<i> affixes; as विशृण्विरे; here the affixes of the लिट् are treated as </i>sarvadhatuka<i> and so there is the </i>Vikarana<i>  श्नु and the उ is changed into व । Thus, वि + शृ + श्नु + इरे = वि + शृ + नु + इरे [[3.1.74]] = वि + शृ + न्व् + इरे [[6.4.87]] = विशृण्विरे । Similarly, सुन्विरे । The लिङ् is sometimes treated in the Vedas both as </i>sarvadhatuka<i> and </i>ardhadhatuka<i> at one and the same time; as  उपस्थेयाम् शरणं बृहन्तम् । Here, by treating the affix as </i>sarvadhatuka<i>, there is elision of स in the लिङ् [[7.2.79]] and by treating it again as </i>ardhadhatuka<i>, the आ of स्था is changed into ए । So also in स्वस्ति the affix is treated as </i>sarvadhatuka_ and there is no substitution of भू for अस् as required by [[2.4.52]].
