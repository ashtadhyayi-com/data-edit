Thus धीवन् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 115) f. धीवरी 'a female artisan'; पीवन् f. पीवरी 'a young woman, a stout woman', शर्वन् f. शर्वरी 'night' (शृ + वनिप् [[3.2.75]]) lit. that which destroys light. So also परलोकदृश्वरी ॥

Words ending in वन् are formed by the affixes ङ्वनिप्, [[3.2.103]] क्वनिप् and वनिप् [[3.2.74]] These words end in न् and consequently would have taken ङीप् even by [[4.1.5]]; the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> arose in order to teach the change of न् into र् in case of words ending in वन् ॥

Vart:- If the affix वन् is ordained to be added to a word ending in हश्, (a letter of हश् <i>pratyahara</i>), and is thus immediately preceded by a soft consonant then this rule does not apply, that is to say, there is neither the application of the affix ङीप् nor the change of म् into र् ॥ Thus सहयुध्वन् is both masculine and feminine as, सहयुध्वा ब्राह्मणः or ब्राह्मणी 'a <i>Brahman</i> brother or sister in arms'. In शर्वन् the वन् is preceded by र् which is a letter of हश् class, but as वन् is not ordained to be applied to शर् but to शृ, and we get the र् indirectly by <i>guna</i>, the <i>vartika</i> does not apply to such a case. Hence शर्वरी ॥
