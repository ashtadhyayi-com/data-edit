The word पाद becomes पाद् when final in certain <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds [[5.4.140]]. Thus द्विपात् is both masculine and feminine, or it may optionally form its feminine by long ई (ङीप्). In the latter alternative, the form will be द्विपदी, the word पाद् being replaced by पद् by [[6.4.130]], (as read with [[1.4.18]]). Similarly त्रिपात् or त्रिपदी; चतुष्पाद् or चतुष्पदी ॥
