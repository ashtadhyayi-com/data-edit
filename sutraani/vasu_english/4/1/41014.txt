This is an <i>adhikara</i> aphorism pure and simple, and has governing force upto [[4.1.77]]: and prohibits the application of affixes to '<i>upasarjanas</i>'. That is to say, whatever we shall treat of hereafter, is to be understood to apply to such terms only, which are not <i>upasarjana</i> or a subordinate term in a compound. (1. 2. 43). Thus the next <i>sutra</i> declares "the affix <i>nip</i> is added in forming the feminine after what ends in short अ, if the affix with which it ends has an indicatory ट्, &c." Thus the word कुरुचर is formed by the affix ट (111.) 2. 16), and ends in अ. The feminine of this word will be formed by ङीप् as कुरुचरी, similarly मद्रचर—f मद्रचरी । But if these words being the last members of a compound, are treated as <i>upasarjana</i> (1. 2. 43), then they will not take the affix ङीप् in the feminine. Now in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound, all the component members are <i>upasarjana</i>, [[2.2.35]]; therefore, the feminine of such compounds will not take ङीप् ॥ Thus, बहुकुरुचरा or बहुमद्रचरा मधुरा ॥ Similarly [[4.1.63]] says, "the affix ङीप् is added after words denoting <i>jati</i>" as, कुक्कुठी, शुकरी ॥ But where these words are <i>upasarjana</i>, '<i>nish</i>' will not be added : as, बहुकुक्कुटा बहुशूकरा मधुरा ॥

As a general rule, <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> (I, 1, 72) does not apply to compounds; but the present <i>sutra</i> indicates by implication that the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies to compounds for the purposes of the application of feminine affixes. For had it not been so, there would have been no necessity of making the present <i>sutra</i> ; for a rule applicable to a simple word as such, would not have applied to it when it was part of a compound-- whether subordinate (<i>upasarjana</i>), or principal (<i>pradhana</i>). But the present <i>sutra</i> indicates that the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> does apply, if the word does not become a subordinate member, but is regarded as the principal member, of a compound.

The feminine of कुम्भकार or नगरकार will be कुम्भकारी or नगरकारी, in as much as the second member here is <i>pradhana</i> : the word '<i>kumbha</i>-<i>kara</i>' being formed by अण् (III, 2, 1), and thus making it possible to apply ङीप् by [[4.1.15]]. The affix अण् referred to in the next <i>sutra</i> refers to the <i>krit</i>-affix अण् [[3.2.1]], as well as to the <i>Taddhita</i> affix अण् ॥
