Thus गार्ग्य + ङीप् = गार्ग्य + ई [[6.4.148]] = गार्ग् + ई [[6.4.150]] = गार्गी 'a female descendant of <i>Garga</i>'; so also वात्सी ॥

Vart:- This rule applies when the affix यञ् denotes a descendant, and not otherwise. Therefore ई will not be applied to form the feminine of द्वैप्य of द्वीप् + यञ् [[4.3.10]]. Its feminine will be द्वैप्या 'a living on or relating to an island'.

The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, (for the affix यञ् could well have been included in the same), is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms; in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of यञ् only runs and not of others.
