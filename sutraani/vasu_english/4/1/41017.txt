Of this affix ष्फ the letter ष् is indicatory [[1.3.6]], and shows that the words formed by this affix will take '<i>nish</i>' [[4.1.41]]. The feminine nature is here manifested by these two affixes jointly, viz by '<i>shpha</i>' and '<i>nish</i>'. The object of saying that '<i>shpha</i>' is to be regarded as a <i>taddhita</i> affix, is that the word so formed may get the designation of <i>pratipadika</i> (1. 2. 46). The affix फ is replaced by the substitute आयन [[7.1.2]]. Thus गार्ग्य + ष्फ + ङीष् = गार्ग्यायणी; so also वात्स्यायनी ॥ This being an optional rule, we have in the alternative, गार्गी and वात्सी ॥

The word  सर्वत्र "every where", of the next <i>sutra</i> is to be read into this, by a process inverse to that of <i>anuvritti</i>, in order to prohibit the application of those rules even which would otherwise debar this. Thus [[4.1.75]] says:- 'the affix चाप् comes after आवट्य' ॥ Here आवट्य ends in यञ्, and by [[4.1.16]], the word आवट्य would have taken the affix nip: [[4.1.75]] debarred this. But according to Eastern Grammarians, here also the affix '<i>shpha</i>' will be added. Thus आवट्यायनी ॥
