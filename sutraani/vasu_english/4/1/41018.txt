The affix ष्फ is invariably added in the feminine after the words beginning with लोहित and ending with क्त when they take the affix यञ्।
The words लोहित &c. are a subdivision of <i>Gargadi</i> class ( IV. 1. 105). The present <i>sutra</i> makes the application of the affix ष्फ, compulsory while it was optional in the last. The word कत refers to the independent <i>pratipadika</i> कत in the said subdivision, which follows immediately after the word कपि, and not to the word कुरुकत of the same class, where the word कत is not an independent full nominal-stem but a member only. Thus, लोहित्यायनी, शांशित्यायनी,  बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥

<i>Karika</i> कण्वात्तु शकलः पूर्वः कतादुत्तर इष्यते ॥
पूर्वोत्तरौ तदन्तादी ष्फाणौ तत्र प्रयोजनम् ॥

For the purposes of the application of ष्फ and अण्, the word शकल which is enumerated in the <i>Ganapatha</i> after the word कण्व (See [[4.1.105]]) should be regarded as if it stood immediately before कण्व and after कत ॥ Thus we have शाकल्यायनी (with ष्फ), and शकलाः with अण्, meaning शाकल्यस्येमे छात्राः 'the pupils of <i>Sakalya</i>'.
