The word कौरव्य is formed by adding the affix ण्य to the base कुरु [[4.1.151]]; this word, ending in अ, would have formed its feminine by टाप् [[4.1.4]], but for the present <i>sutra</i>. So also by [[4.1.119]], the word माण्डूक is formed by अण् added to मण्डूक; and the feminine of <i>manduka</i> would have been formed by <i>nip</i> [[4.1.15]], but for the present aphorism, which supersedes that affix. Thus कौरव्यायणी, माण्डूकायनी ॥

How do you explain the form कौरवी in the phrase कौरवी सेना ?

We explain it by saying that कौरवी is not the feminine of कौरव्य; but of कौरव, formed by adding अण् to कुरु by <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.120]].

Vart:- The word आसुरि should be enumerated along with <i>kauravya</i> and <i>mandukya</i>. Thus आसुरायणी ॥ The word आसुरि is formed by the affix इञ् added to the word असुर; the word '<i>asuri</i>' would, therefore have taken the affix अण्  in forming the further derivative [[4.2.112]]. But according to the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>, the word, '<i>asuri</i>' should form its further derivative (called also शैषिक) by taking the affix छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus आसुरीयः कल्पः (तेन प्रोक्तम्) ॥
