The affix ङीप् is used in the feminine after a बहुव्रीहि समास ending in the word ऊधस् 'an udder'.
Thus the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound of कुण्ड 'a bowl' and ऊधस् will be कुण्डोधस्; then the final of <i>udhas</i> is replaced by the substitute अनङ् [[5.4.131]]; thus we have कुण्डोधन्; which would have been liable to the rules [[4.1.12]], (IV. 1. 13.) <i>ante</i> ; the present ¬<i>sutra</i> enjoins ङीष् instead. Thus कुण्डोध्नी [[6.4.134]] 'a woman with full bosom'; घटोध्नी 'a cow with udders like jars'.

Why do we say 'after a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound'? Observe प्राप्ता ऊधः = प्राप्तोधाः [[2.2.4]] which is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound.

The <i>Sutra</i> [[4.1.28]] also is debarred in this case: for though the penultimate अ is elided by the [[6.4.134]], yet rule [[4.1.28]] does not apply here.

The substitution of अन् for the final of ऊधस् takes place only then, when the feminine nature is to be expressed and not otherwise. Therefore in the masculine we have महोधा पर्जन्यः 'the big-bosomed cloud'.
