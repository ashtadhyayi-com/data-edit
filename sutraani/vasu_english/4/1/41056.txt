The feminine affix ङीष् does not come after a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) which denoting a part of the body, belongs to the class क्रोडा 'the flank' etc., of a horse', nor when the word is a stem of more than two syllables.
The class क्रोड् &c. is <i>akriti</i>-<i>gana</i>, that is a class of words constituted by usage. The following are some of the examples:- As कल्याणक्रोडा, कल्याणखुरा, कल्याणोखा, कल्याणबाला, कल्याणशफा, कल्याणगुदा, कल्याणघाणा ॥ So also सुभगा, सुगला, &c. Of the case where the word is polysyllabic, the examples are सुजघना, पृथुजघना, महाललाटा, ॥ The word कोडा is feminine itself, and in the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> the feminine sign of the first member is elided by <i>pungvad</i>-<i>bhava</i>, and क्रोडा is shortened to क्रोड because it is an <i>upasarjana</i> (1. 2. 48).
