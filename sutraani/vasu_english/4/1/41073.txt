The feminine affix ङीन् comes after the words शार्ङ्गरव etc. and that which ends with the affix अञ्।
Thus शार्ङ्गरवी 'a <i>Sarngrava</i> woman', कापटवी 'a <i>Kapatava</i> woman'. So also after a word formed with the affix अञ् (as ordained in S. 86, and 104 &c. of this chapter), as, बैदी 'a female descendant of <i>Bida</i>'. और्वी 'a female descendant of <i>Urva</i>'. This <i>sutra</i> applies to words expressing <i>jati</i> or kind. In other words, this aphorism debars the affix ङीष् of [[4.1.63]] &c. where it came after <i>jati</i>-<i>vachaka</i> words; but it does not debar that ङीष् which is employed in describing the relation of wife, such as, the ङीष् of [[4.1.48]].

The difference between ङीष् and ङीन् consists in accent only, the resultant forms otherwise being the same. The words formed by ङीन् will have <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् ([[6.1.197]] a word ending with an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् has <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable') : while the word formed by ङीष् will have acute accent on the affix. Thus बैदी 'a female descendant of <i>Bida</i>', and बैदी 'the wife of <i>Baida</i>'.

The following is a list of <i>Sarngaravadi</i> class words:-

1 शार्गंरव, 2 कापटव, 3 गौग्गुलव, 4 ब्राह्मण, 5 बैद, 6 गौतम ॥ These words are formed by the affix अण् the first four being formed by the अण् of ( IV. 1. 83) from शृंगरु, कपटु, गुग्गुलु and ब्रह्मन्; the word गौतम is formed from गोतम by the अण् of [[4.1.114]]. This word is also included in <i>Gauradi</i> class [[4.1.41]]. 7 कामण्डलेय, 8 ब्राह्मकृतेव, 9 आनिचेय, 10 आनिधेय, 11 आशीकेय ॥ These are formed by ढक् [[4.1.123]] except <i>kamandaleya</i> which is formed by ढञ् [[4.1.135]]. 12 वात्स्यायन, 13 मौञ्जायन ॥ These are formed by फक् of (IV. I. 101) and [[4.1.99]], and denote castes or <i>Gotra</i>. 14 कैकसेय is also formed by ढक् [[4.1.123]]. 15 काव्य 16 शैव्य are formed by ञ्यङ् [[4.1.171]]. 17 एहि, 18 पर्येहि are formed by इन् added to आ + इह् 'to try', and परि + आ + इह् (<i>Un</i> IV. 117 सर्व धातुभ्य इन्) 19 आश्मरथ्य is formed by यञ् [[4.1.105]]. 20 औदपान is formed by अण् [[4.3.76]]. 21 अराल, 22 चण्डाल, 23 वतण्डः are <i>jati</i> words. 24 भोगवत्, 25 गौरिमत् ॥ These take ङ्गीन् when denoting a Name. These words are formed by the affix मतुप्, and are consequently उगित्, and should have taken ङीप् [[4.1.6]]. This ordains ङीन् ॥

Q. The word भोग is formed by घञ् and गौरि is formed by इञ् [[4.1.95]], both are <i>adyuddatta</i> owing to ञ् [[6.1.197]]. When मतुप् is added, the accent remains unchanged, for <i>matup</i> being पित् is <i>anudatta</i> (I11. 1. 4). Therefore whether ङीप् be added or ङीन् to these words, it makes no difference in the accent, for they remain <i>adyudatta</i>. Where is the necessity of including these two words in this list.

Ans. To this we reply घादिषु नित्यम् हृस्वार्थम् ॥ For had these words taken ङीप् of [[4.1.6]], then the long ई would have been optionally shortened before the affixes घ &c. by [[6.3.45]]. But by taking ङीन् the shortening is compulsory [[6.3.43]], and not optional. Because the च in the <i>sutra</i> उगितश्च [[6.3.45]] has the force of the word इति, and means the नदी words formed by adding ई to उगित् words, by enunciating the word उगित् are optionally shortened. Therefore [[4.1.6]] where the word उगित् is used is governed by this rule of optional shortening, and not the words formed by ङीन् ॥

26 नृ 27 नर. The word नृ would have taken ङीप् by [[4.1.5]], and नर would have taken ङीष् as it denotes a <i>jati</i>. These words take <i>vriddhi</i> before ङीन्, the form being नारी in both cases.
