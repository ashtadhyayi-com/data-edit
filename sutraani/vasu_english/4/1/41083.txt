Up to aphorism [[4.4.2]], the affix अण् has a governing influence, except where it is specifically superseded by any particular rule. This aphorism may be looked upon either as an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i> or a <i>paribhasha</i> <i>sutra</i> or a <i>vidhi</i> <i>sutra</i>. The application of this aphorism will be illustrated throughout the next three chapters. Thus in [[4.1.92]] तस्यापत्यम् we read the present aphorism and add the affix अण् in the sense of 'his son'. As औपगवः 'the son of उपगुः'; कापटवः 'the son of <i>Kapatu</i>'.

This affix has various meanings, such as, a patronymic [[4.1.92]], coloured with [[4.2.1]], sidereal time [[4.1.3]], revealed <i>sama</i>-<i>veda</i> [[4.1.7]], covered car [[4.2.10]] &c.
