The affix ण्य comes, in the various senses taught here-in-after antecedently to तेन दीव्यति खनति जयति जितम् [[4.4.2]] etc. after the Proper Names - 1. दिति 2. अदिति 3. आदित्य and that which has the word पति as its final member.
Thus दिति + ण्य = दैत्यः 'the son of <i>Diti</i>.' आदित्यः 'the descendant of <i>Aditi</i>', आदित्यम् ' sacred to <i>Aditya</i>.' Similarly with words ending with पति, as प्रजापति + ण्य = प्राजापत्यं; so also सैनापत्यम् ॥

Vart:- So also after the word यम; as याम्यम् ॥

Vart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, after the words वाच्, मति and पितृमत् ॥ As वाच्यम् (<i>Vs</i>, 13, 58.) मात्यम् and पैतृमत्यम् ॥

Vart:- The affixes ञ् and अञ् come after the word पृथिवी ॥ Thus पृथिवी + ञ = पार्थिव; पृथिवी + अञ् = पार्थिव ॥ The resulting forms are the same, but the feminine of the former will be पार्थिवा by (IV. I. 4), and that of the latter पार्थिवी applying [[4.1.15]].

Vart:- The affixes यञ् and अञ् come after the word देव 'a god'. As दैव्यम् or दैवम् 'divine'.

Vart:- There is elision of the टि of बहिस्, and there is the affix यञ्; as बहिस् + यञ् = बाह्यः 'external'. Vart:- and the affix ईकक् may be employed. As बहिस् + ईकक् = बाहिकः 'external'. (VII. 2. 118 किति च, there is <i>vriddhi</i> of the first vowel when the <i>Taddhita</i> affix has an indicatory क्). Vart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i> it takes the affix ईकञ् as बाहिकः the difference being in the accent [[6.1.197]].

The word बहिस् is an अव्यय, and the above <i>vartika</i> declares that its टि portion is elided. This very fact indicates by implication, that the टि of other <i>Avyayas</i> need not necessarily be elided before those affixes, before which the base is called भ <i>bha</i>. In fact the following <i>vartika</i> अव्यायानाञ्च (the टि of the <i>avyaya</i> base is elided) given under (sutra<i> [[6.4.144]] (the टि of the base </i>bha<i> is elided when a </i>taddhita<i> affix follows) is not a universal rule. Thus from the </i>avyaya<i> आरात् we get आराती &c; here the टि is not elided.

Vart:- Of the word स्थामन् the टि is replaced by अ as अश्वत्थामः ॥

Vart:- The टि of लोमन् is replaced by ञ in the plural when the patronymic affixes follow; as उडुलोमाः, शरलोमाः ॥ Why do we say in the plural number ? Witness औडुलोमिः, शारलोमिः [[4.1.99]].

Vart:- When an affix beginning with a vowel presents itself after the word गो, let the affix यत् be substituted for it. Thus what is descended (or produced, &c) from गो is expressed by गव्यम् [[6.1.79]]. Why do we say 'beginning with a vowel' ? Observe गोभ्यो हितं or आगतं = गोरूप्यम् and गोमयम् ॥

Vart:- These affixes ण्य &c, taught in this </i>sutra<i> will come, to the exclusion of all the other affixes hereinafter taught, which are employed in especial senses. Thus अण् is employed especially to denote a descendant. But after the words दिति &c अण् will not be employed, but ण्य, as दैत्य 'a descendant of दिति'. So also वानस्पत्यम् = (वनस्पतीनाम् समुहः), to the exclusion of [[4.2.37]] &c. In fact the rule for विप्रतिषेधे परंकार्य्यम् [[1.4.2]] does not hold good here.

If that be so, how do you explain the form दैतेयः ॥ This word is not directly formed from the word दिति but from दिती, the feminine of the word दिति, formed by the affix ङीष् [[4.1.45]], the word दिति being formed by the </i>Krit<i> affix क्तिन् and therefore it will take ङीष् in the feminine). To the feminine word दिती is added ढक् and we get दैतेयः ॥ The </i>Paribhasha<i> प्रातिपदिकग्रहणे लिङ्ग विशिष्टस्यापि ग्रहणम् (a rule of grammar which applies to a masculine applies also to the same word in the feminine) is not of universal application, as this very illustration shows. Others consider the form दैतेय as incorrect, as not to be found either in the </i>Mahabhashya<i> or any </i>Vartika_.
