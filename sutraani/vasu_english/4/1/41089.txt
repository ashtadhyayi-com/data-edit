The लुक् elision of गोत्र (Patronymic) affixes in plural, which have been enjoined by sūtras यस्कादिभ्यो गोत्रे [[2.4.63]] etc. and the rest is prohibited, when the affix has an initial vowel and it has the sense of the various affixes taught antecedent to तेन दीव्यति खनति जयति जितम् [[4.4.2]].
Thus the plural of गार्ग्य is गर्गाः [[2.4.64]]. But the disciples of गर्गाः will be formed by the affix छ (IV. 21. 114) which is a <i>pragdivyatiya</i> affix and for the purposes of adding this affix the base will be considered to be गार्ग्यः as if there was no elision. Thus गार्ग्याः + छ = गार्गीयाः [[7.1.2]] and [[6.4.151]], and not गर्गीयाः । Similarly वात्सीयाः, आत्रयीयाः, खारपायणीयाः 'disciples of <i>Vatsyas</i>, <i>Atreyas</i>, <i>Kharpayanas</i>.'

Why do we say "गोत्रे" i. e. "when the <i>Gotra</i> affix is elided"? Observe कौबलम्, बादरम् ॥ Here the affix denoting "fruit" is elided by लुक् by <i>Sutra</i> [[4.3.163]]. Then when the <i>pragdivytiya</i> affix अण् is added, the <i>luk</i>-elision is maintained. Thus the fruit of बदरी is बदरम्; from which बादरम् 'belonging to or coming from the jujube-fruit.'

Why do we say "having an initial vowel"? Observe गर्गेभ्य आगतम् = गर्गरूप्यम् and not गार्गरूप्यम्; and गर्गमयम्; and not गार्गमयम् ॥ Here the affix रूप्य, a <i>pragdivyatiya</i> affix taught in <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.81]] does not begin with a vowel; therefore it is added to गर्ग and not गार्ग्य ॥ Similarly the next affix मयट् [[4.3.82]].

Why do we say "when it has the sense of a <i>pragdivyatiya</i> affix" ? Thus गर्गेभ्यो हितम् = गर्गीयम् 'who is fit for the <i>Gargas</i>'. Here the affix छ [[5.1.1]] has the sense of 'suitable for that', as taught in <i>Sutra</i> (V. I. 5) not one of the <i>pragdivyatiya</i> senses. Hence the <i>luk</i> elision is maintained.

The <i>Gotra</i>-affixes are taught to be elided in the plural only: and when after such supposed elision a Singular or Dual Person is intended, this rule will still apply and there will be no elision. Thus बिद will form its <i>Gotra</i> derivative by अञ् [[4.1.104]] as बिद + अञ् = बैदः ॥ The plural of बैद will be बिदाः by the elision of अञ् ॥ One <i>yuvan</i> or two <i>yuvan</i> descendants of these बिदाः will be formed by the affix इञ् [[4.1.95]], for the application of which the word बिदाः will be supposed not to have lost its अञ्, therefore इञ् will be added to बैद, thus बैद + इञ्; then this इञ् is elided by [[2.4.58]]. The resultant form is बैदः, बैदो ॥ The many descendants (in the plural) of one बैदः or two बैदः will be बिदाः ॥
