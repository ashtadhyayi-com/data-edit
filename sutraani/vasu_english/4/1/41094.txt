This is also a <i>niyama</i> or restrictive rule. Thus the <i>Yuvan</i> of गार्ग्य is गार्ग्यायणः [[4.1.101]]. Similarly वात्स्यायणः, दाक्षायणः, प्लाक्षायणः, औपगविः, नाडायनिः ॥

Why do we say "but in the Feminine the word is not termed <i>Yuvan</i>"? Observe दाक्षी which is the feminine of दाक्षिः (<i>Gotra</i>) as well as of दाक्षायणः (<i>Yuvan</i>). Similarly प्लाक्षी feminine of प्लाक्षिः and प्लाक्षायणः ॥ In short, <i>Yuvan</i> affixes are not added in the feminine. If it is intended to denote a feminine descendant of the kind <i>Yuvan</i>, the feminine word formed by <i>Gotra</i> affix will denote such a descendant also.

What is here prohibited i. e. is the term <i>Gotra</i> superseded by the term <i>Yuvan</i>? If it is a <i>niyama</i> rule, there will be no <i>niyama</i> with regard to the feminine, as the prohibition is contained in the same sentence. Therefore in the feminine, the <i>Yuvan</i> affix will not get the designation of <i>Gotra</i>, because <i>Gotra</i>-name is debarred by <i>Yuvan</i> Name. Therefore the <i>sutra</i> should be divided in two, e. g. गोत्राद् यूनि प्रत्ययो भवति (2) ततोऽस्त्रियाम् ॥ (1) After a <i>Gotra</i> formed word a new affix is added in denoting a <i>Yuvan</i> descendant, (2) but not so in the feminine. In fact the name <i>Yuvan</i> is prohibited in the feminine, therefore, the feminine will be known <i>Gotra</i> always and never by <i>Yuvan</i>.
