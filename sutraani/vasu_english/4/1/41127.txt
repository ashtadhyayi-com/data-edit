The word कुलटा means literally one who wanders (अटति) from one family (कुल) to another, i.e. an unchaste woman. This <i>sutra</i> is made to teach substitution only, for कुलटा would have taken ढक् by the general rule (IV. I. 120). Thus कुलटा + ढक् = कुलटिन् + ढक् = कौलटिनेयः or कौलटेयः 'son of an unchaste woman.' This word कुलटा being a word denoting contempt, will take also the affix ढक् by [[4.1.131]]. Thus कौलटेरः ॥
