The affixes ण and फिञ् comes in the sense of descendant of a person belonging to सुविर country after the word फाण्टाहृति and मिमता।
This debars फक् । By the rule of composition in (11. 2. 34), the word मिमत consisting of less syllables than फाण्टाहृत, ought to have been placed first. Its not being placed first in this <i>sutra</i> indicates, that <i>Sutra</i> (1. 3. 10) does not apply here. So that both the affixes ण and फिञ् are applied to each of these words, and not one to each respectively, Thus फाण्टाहृतः or फाण्टाहृतायनिः, मैमतः or मैमतायनिः ॥

When not denoting <i>Sauvira</i> <i>Gotras</i>, we have फाण्टाहृतायनः and मैमतायनः (by फक् ॥ See [[4.1.101]] and [[4.1.99]]). The word मिमत belongs to <i>Nadadi</i>-class. [[4.1.99]].
