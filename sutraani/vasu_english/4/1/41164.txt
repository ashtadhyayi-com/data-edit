Even when a वंश्य like father &c is not alive (and a brother is not <i>vansya</i>), the younger brother gets the designation of <i>yuvan</i>, when the elder brother is alive; thus:

गर्गः (dead) -> गार्गिः (dead) -> गार्ग्यः (dead) ->  गार्ग्यः, गार्ग्यायणः

The word वंश्यः is confined to ancestors like father &c, so a brother can never be a <i>vansya</i>, because he is not the source from which the other brother arises. This <i>sutra</i> applies to cases when <i>Vansya</i> is not meant. Thus <i>Gargyayna</i> is the name of the younger brother with reference to the elder brother, <i>Gargya</i>; similarly <i>Vatsyayana</i>, <i>Dakhsayana</i>, and <i>Plakshayana</i>.
