The affixes treated of in these six <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.168]] to [[4.1.173]] are called <i>Tadraja</i>. The pronoun ते refers to these only and not to all the affixes treated or before S. [[4.1.168]]; for they have the special designation of <i>Gotra</i> and <i>Yuvan</i> see [[2.4.62]]. The illustrations of these have already been given under each of the above six aphorisms.
