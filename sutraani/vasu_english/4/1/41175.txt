Namely the affix अञ् which would have come after the word  कम्बोज because it denotes a country as well as a <i>Kshatriya</i> tribe, is elided. Thus कम्बोजः 'The king of <i>Kamboja</i>'. 
It should be stated rather 'after <i>Kamboja</i> and the like', because we find the affix elided after '<i>Chola</i>' &c. Thus चोलः 'the king of <i>Cholas</i>'. So also केरलः शकः यवनः ॥
