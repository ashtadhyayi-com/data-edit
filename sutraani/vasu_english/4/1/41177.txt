In forming the feminine of a word which ends in the masculine in the तद्राजा affix अ , the affix is लुक् elided.
Thus m. शौरसेनः, f. शूरसेनी;  m. माद्रः j. मद्री ॥ The word अतः of the <i>sutra</i> should not be construed by the rule of <i>tadanata</i> <i>vidhi</i> (1. 1. 72). If so construed it will mean "a <i>Tadraja</i> affix ending in अ is elided". There have been taught five <i>Tadraja</i> affixes, namely '<i>an</i> अ)', '<i>an</i> (अ)', 'nyan (य)', 'nya (य)' and 'in (इ)'. Of these the first four all end in अ; therefore all these four affixes should be elided in the feminine. But this is not the meaning of the author; for had it been so, there would have been no necessity of the previous <i>sutra</i>, for then the present <i>sutra</i> would have covered the case of '<i>Avanti</i>', '<i>Kunti</i>' and '<i>Kuru</i>'. But the very fact of this <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.176]] indicates by ज्ञापक, that the <i>tadanta</i> <i>vidhi</i> does not apply here. Therefore, the feminine of आम्बष्ठ्यः is आम्बष्ठ्या, of सौवीर्यः is सौवीर्या ॥
