The affix छ also comes in the sense of "that its deity" after the word <i>Aponaptri</i> and <i>Apannaptri</i>. This debars अण् ॥ Thus अपोनपत्रीयं or अपान्नप्त्रीयम् 'oblation sacred to <i>Aponapat</i> or <i>Apannapat</i>'. This is made a separate <i>sutra</i>, in order to prevent the application of rule [[1.3.10]]. For if it was included in the last, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus: "The affixes घ and छ come after <i>Aponaptri</i> and <i>Apannaptri</i>", the meaning of which according to maxim I. 3. 10 would have been "the affix घ comes after <i>Aponaptri</i>, and छ after <i>Apannaptri</i>". But this is not what the author intended. Hence two distinct <i>sutras</i>.

Vart:- The affix छ comes after the words पैंगाक्षीपुत्र &c. As, पैंगाक्षीपुत्रीयम्, तार्णबिन्दवीयम् ॥

Vart:- The word शतरुद्र takes घ and छ both : e. g. शतरुद्रीयम् and शतरुद्रियं ॥
