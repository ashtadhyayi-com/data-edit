In others words, the <i>sutra</i> means that the affix is added to a word in the accusative case in construction, denoting a person who studies or knows, that. As छन्दोऽधीते = छान्दसः 'who studies Prosody'. वैयाकरणः [[7.3.3]] 'who knows grammar'. So also नैरुक्तः, नैमित्तः 'who knows the causes'. भौहूर्त्तः, औत्पातः ॥ The word तद् is repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, in order to show a distinction between one who studies and who understands.
