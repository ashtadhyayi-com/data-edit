The words of this aphorism require a detailed examination. तद् 'that', i.e. the word in construction to which the affix is to be added must be in the nominative case. अस्मिन् "in this" -- this gives the meaning of the affix; अस्ति "is" this qualifies the sense of the base. इति is added merely for the sake of distinctness, serving the same purpose as quotation marks in modern writing. देशेतन्नाम्नि "a country having that name"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. The sense is:- "the affixes already taught or to be taught, come after a word being in the nominative case in construction, in the sense of the location, when the whole word so formed denotes the name of a country in which that thing exists".

This <i>sutra</i> and the three subsequent <i>sutras</i> are in fact one, though divided into four, for purposes of convenience. The affixes having the sense of these four <i>sutras</i>, are called चातुरर्थिक "quadruple significants".

Thus उदुम्बरा अस्मिन् देशे सन्ति = औदुम्बरः <i>Audumbara</i>--the country in which there are glomerous fig trees. Similarly बाल्बजः, पार्वतः &c. all these words are formed by the universal affix अण् [[4.1.83]].

This <i>sutra</i> debars the अत्वर्थीय affixes.
