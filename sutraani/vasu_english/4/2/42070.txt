In this aphorism the word, to which the affix is to be added, is not shown. The word तस्य must, therefore, be supplied from the last <i>sutra</i>. It means, therefore, "an affix is added to a word in the genetive case in construction, in the sense of not far off" the whole word being the name of a place. Thus विदिशाया अदूर भवं = वैदिशम् is the city in the neighbourhood of which the river <i>Vidisa</i> flows. So also हैमवतम् ॥

The च has the force of combining the sense of all the three previous aphorisms with this; so that the four <i>sutras</i> 67, 68, 69 and 70 form but one complete <i>sutra</i>, and the meaning denoted by these will be understood in the subsequent aphorisms.
