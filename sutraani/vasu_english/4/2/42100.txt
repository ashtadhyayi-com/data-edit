As राङ्कवो गौः or राङ्कवायणो गौः but राङ्कवको मनुष्यः [[4.2.134]].

Q. The word रंकु belongs to कच्छादि class [[4.2.133]]; and when a human being is to be denoted, then by [[4.2.134]], it will take the affix अण्, and when a non-human being is to be designated, then it will take अण् by rule [[4.2.133]]; then where is the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> by which अण् is enjoined when a non-human being is to be designated ? To this the reply is that the force of the negative affix in <i>amanuysha</i> is that of इव; i.e. अमनुष्य = मनुष्य सदृशः "a being like man, but not man". The word अमनुष्य does not mean 'anything which is not a man'. For had this been its meaning, then a blanket is also a thing which is not a man, and in denoting a blanket, we should add ष्फक्; but we never do so. When blanket is to be denoted we add अण् of [[4.2.133]], as राङ्कवः "a woolen blanket". When we want to denote a living being other than man, then we add अण् and ष्फक् of this <i>sutra</i>. The अण् is repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, for the purpose also of showing that otherwise अण् would have been debarred by the special affix ष्फक् ॥ 

The word रंकु is the name of a country, it would have taken अण् under the universal rule [[4.1.83]], but this is debarred by वुञ् of [[4.2.125]], and वुञ् is debarred by ठञ् of [[4.2.119]], and ठञ् is debarred by अण् of [[4.2.132]], as it has क् as penultimate, the present <i>sutra</i> debars that and ordains अण् and ष्फक् ॥
