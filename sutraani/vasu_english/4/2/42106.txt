This debars अण् ॥Thus काकतीरम्, पाल्वलतीरम्, वार्करूप्यम्, शैवरूप्यम् ॥ The words formed by अञ्, take the affix ङीप् in the feminine [[4.1.15]]; those in ञ take the affix टाप् [[4.1.4]]. The <i>sutra</i> is not enunciated as तीररूप्यान्तात्, for had it been so, the affix would apply to बहुरूप्य also, where रूप्य is final, but cannot be called <i>uttara</i>-<i>pada</i>, as '<i>bahu</i>' is not a <i>pada</i> but is an affix [[5.3.68]]. Therefore, we have बाहुरूप्यम् formed by अण् ॥
