Here the word गोत्रे does not qualify the sense of the base, nor does it give the sense of the affix. It simply means "that after a word ending with the affix which has been ordained after the words <i>Kanva</i> &c, in denoting a <i>Gotra</i> or Family-name; the affix अण् is employed in the remaining senses." This debars the affix छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus काण्वाः "the pupils of <i>Kanva</i>". गौकक्षाः [[4.1.105]].

Why do we say "when denoting Family-names?" Thus the word काण्व, when it means कण्व देवताऽस्य, forms its secondary derivative काण्वीयम् by छ ॥

The <i>Kanva</i>-class is a sub-class of <i>Gargadi</i>. The Family-names from कण्व and गौकक्ष are का꣡ण्व्य and गौ꣡काक्ष्य by rule [[4.1.105]]. To this, the affix अण् is added. काण्व्य + अण् = काण्वः꣡ [[6.4.148]] and [[6.4.152]].
