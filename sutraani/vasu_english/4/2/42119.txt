The phrase 'वृद्धात्' does not govern this <i>sutra</i>. For had it been understood in this aphorism, there would have been no necessity of repeating it in the next.

Thus तैषादकर्षुकः, शाबरजम्बुकः ॥ Why do we say देशे 'denoting a country'? Observe पाटवाः 'the pupils of पटु' formed by अण् ॥

In the previous <i>sutras</i>, the <i>anuvritti</i> of ठञ् and ञिठ् both were current; hence the repetition of ठञ् in this <i>sutra</i>, because we could not take the <i>anuvritti</i> of ठञ् from the last <i>sutra</i> without drawing the <i>anuvritti</i> of ञिठ् ॥
