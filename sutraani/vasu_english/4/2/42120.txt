The phrase ओर्देशी is here understood. Thus आढकजम्बुकः, शाकजम्बुकः नापितवास्तुकः ॥

The affix ठञ् would have been valid by the last <i>sutra</i> also, the present <i>sutra</i> makes a नियम or restriction, showing that in the case of words denoting places of East, the rule applies to those words only, which are <i>Vriddha</i>. Therefore it does not apply to मल्लवास्तु, from which we have माल्लवास्तवः ॥
