The phrases वृद्धात् and देशे are understood here, being qualified by जनपद and तदवधि ॥ This debars the affix छ ॥ Thus आभिसारकः and आदर्शकः are examples of जनपद ॥ And औपुष्टकः and श्यामायनकः from औपुष्ट and श्यामायन two uninhabited countries, are illustrations of जनपदावधि ॥

The अवधि or limit of an inhabited country or जनपद must be a country and not a village. This is so, in order to prevent, by anticipation, the application of छ by [[4.2.137]] to words like त्रिगर्त्त which is an arid desert: as त्रैगर्त्तकः ॥ The word तदवधि means either "the boundary of that (जनपद)" or "that which itself is a boundary".
