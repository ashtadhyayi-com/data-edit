Thus कौरवकः or कौरवः꣡, यौगन्धरकः or गौगन्धरः꣡ ॥ These words denote जनपद or inhabited countries, and therefore by <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.125]] they would always, have taken the affix वुञ्. The present <i>sutra</i> makes the application of वुञ् optional and not obligatory. The word कुरु occurs in the list of कच्छादि class [[4.2.133]]. By virtue of its being so classified, it will take अण् also. And when it means man or something found in men, it will take necessarily, not optionally, the affix वुञ् by virtue of <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.134]]. As कौरवको मनुष्यः, कौरवकमस्य हसितम् ॥ This aphorism therefore, teaches option regarding कुरु with these restrictions, while it teaches option absolutely with regard to the word युगन्धरः ॥
