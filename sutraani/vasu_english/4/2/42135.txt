The word साल्व which occurs in the कच्छादि class, would have taken वुञ् by the last <i>sutra</i>, when the sense was that of a man or some human attribute. The present <i>sutra</i> makes a restriction. Thus साल्वको मनुष्यः, साल्वकमस्य हसितं जल्पितं &c. But साल्वः पदाति र्व्रजति 'the <i>Salva</i> foot soldier goes.'
