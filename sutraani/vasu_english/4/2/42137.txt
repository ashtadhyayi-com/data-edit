This debars अण् ॥ The word देशे is to be read into the <i>sutra</i>. This rule being a subsequent one debars the affixes ठञ् and ञिठ् of <i>sutra</i> 117 <i>ante</i>. Thus वृकगर्तीयं, शृगालगर्तीयम्, श्वाविद्गर्तीयम् 'born in porcupine's hole &c'. The word उत्तरपद is used in the <i>sutra</i>, so as to prevent the application of the rule to a word which ends in गर्त, but is preceded by the affix बहु, as बाहुगर्तम् ॥ Here बहु is an affix [[5.3.68]] and not a <i>pada</i>.
