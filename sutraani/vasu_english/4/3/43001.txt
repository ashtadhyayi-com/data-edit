The affix खञ् also comes optionally in the remaining senses after the words 1. युष्मद् and 2. अस्मद्।
The regulating power of the word देशे ceases. The word च indicates that the affix may be छ as well. The word "optionally" shows that the general affix अण् may also be employed. Thus there are three affixes, खञ्, च and अण्, and hence there being no equal enumeration, the rule of mutual correspondence [[1.3.10]] does not apply.

The words युष्मद् and अस्मद् are <i>Vriddha</i>, as they belong to <i>Tyadadi</i> class [[1.1.74]], and would have taken छ by (IV, 2. 114); the present <i>sutra</i> enjoins three affixes for each. Thus युष्मद् + अण् = युष्माक + अण् [[4.3.2]] = यौष्माकः युष्मद् + छ = युष्मद् + ईय = युष्मदीयः (VII. I. 2). युष्मद् + खञ् = युष्माक + ईन (IV. 3. 2.) = यौष्माकीणः (VII. I. 2); and [[8.4.2]]. So also आस्माकः, अस्मदीय; and आस्माकीनः ॥
