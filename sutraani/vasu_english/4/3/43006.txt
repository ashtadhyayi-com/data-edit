By च, the affix यत् is also used. This debars अण् ॥ Thus पूर्वार्ध्यम्, पौर्वार्धिकम्, दक्षिणार्ध्यम् or दाक्षिणार्द्धिकम् ॥

The word पद is used in the <i>sutra</i> in order to prevent ambiguity. Had the <i>sutra</i> stood merely as दिक्पूर्वाट् ठञ्च, it might have meant [[1.1.68]], '<i>Ardha</i> preceded by the word दिक् takes ठञ् also', for then स्वरूपविधि would have applied, and दिगर्धे जातः would have taken the affix.
