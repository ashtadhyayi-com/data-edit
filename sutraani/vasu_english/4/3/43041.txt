Except the word 'adapted' which is the meaning of the word संभूत, all the other words of the <i>sutra</i> have been supplied from the previous aphorisms. The word संभूत does not mean in this <i>sutra</i> 'origin' or 'existence', for the word जात and भव already express that notion. It here means 'suitableness' 'adequacy' i.e. अवक्लृप्तिः and प्रमाणातिरेकः ॥

Thus स्रुघ्ने संभवति = सौघ्नः 'what is suited to the country of <i>Srughna</i>.' So also माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥ The word तत्र is understood here also.
