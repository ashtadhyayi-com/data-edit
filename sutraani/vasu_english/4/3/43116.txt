Thus वररुचिना कृताः = वाररुचाः श्लोकाः 'the verses composed by <i>Vararuchi</i>'. So also हैकुपादो ग्रन्थः, भैकुराटो ग्रन्थः, जालूकः ॥

Why do we say 'a book'? Observe तक्षकृतः प्रासादः 'the palace made by <i>Taksha</i>'.

That which one originates is called कृतः and is therefore an 'art', while knowledge of laws &c. that already exist, but are discovered for the first time by some one, is called उपज्ञातं ॥
