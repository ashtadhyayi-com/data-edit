By the word च in the <i>sutra</i>, the phrase तस्य विकारः is also read into the <i>sutra</i>.

Thus कपोतस्य विकारोऽवयवो वा = कापोतः [[4.3.154]] ॥ So also मायूरः, तैत्तिरः 'a modification, product or part of a peacock &c -- viz a fan &c.' So also ओषधिः as, मौर्वम् 'product of <i>Murva</i> i.e. ashes or the stalk of <i>Murva</i>'. So also वृक्ष, as, कारीरं meaning "the stalk or the ashes of <i>Karira</i> tree".

In the subsequent <i>sutras</i>, both the words विकार and अवयव have governing force. But after words which denote non-animals, non-plants or non-trees, the affixes have only the sense of विकार ॥ This is a rather unique case of double <i>anuvritti</i>, not co-extensive in every respect.
