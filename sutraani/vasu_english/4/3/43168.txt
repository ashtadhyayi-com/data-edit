The affixes यञ् and अञ् come respectively in the sense of 'its product' after the words 1. कंसीय and 2. परशव्य and there is लुक् elision (of the छ and यत् affixes of those words).
The word कंसीयः is formed by छ [[5.1.1]], and परशव्य is formed by adding यत् [[5.1.2]]. These affixes छ and यत् are elided when the affixes यञ् and अञ् are added. Thus कंसीय + यञ् = कंस + यञ् = कांस्यः so also पारशव from परशव्य thus परशव्य + अञ् = परशु + अञ् = पारशवः ॥

The words लुक् च mean 'there shall be elision'. Of what? Certainly not of the primitive, for लुक् is never applied to the elision of a base, but of an affix only [[1.1.61]]. It follows therefore that the elision is of the affixes of कंसीय and परशव्य ॥ Now these words have two affixes, thus. To the root कम् is added first the <i>Unadi</i> affix स (<i>Un</i> III. 62) and we get कंस; next to कंस is added छ. So also to पर + शृ is added the affix उ (<i>Un</i> I. 33) and we have परशु, to which is then added यत् and we have परशव्य ॥ The question arises, should these affixes स and उ be also elided. The answer is 'no'. The word प्रातिपदिकात् of [[4.1.1]] is understood is this <i>sutra</i>; so the elision will take place of those affixes only which follow a <i>pratipadika</i>. But स and उ are added to a <i>Dhatu</i> and not a <i>pratipadika</i>, hence those affixes are saved from the operation of लुक् ॥

The word परशव्य being gravely accented on the first [[6.1.185]] would have taken अञ् by [[4.3.140]]. The present <i>sutra</i> teaches the elision only of its affix यत्, अञ् being already obtained.

Q. The final अ of कंसीय and परशव्य will be elided by [[6.4.148]] before these <i>taddhita</i> affixes, and after such elision, the final य् will be elided by [[6.4.150]], where is then the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>?

A. The final य् will not be elided, because [[6.4.150]] will apply only then, when an affix beginning with long ई follows, which is not the case here.
