Thus कुटिलिकया हरति मृगो व्याधं = कौटिलिको मृगः 'a deer which carries (or entices away) into crooked ways' or 'a hunter who hunts by coming stealthily on his prey'. कुटिलिकया हरति अङ्गारान् = कौटिलिकः कर्मारः 'a blacksmith, -- who carries burning coals on an iron forge'.

The word कुटिलिका means 'crooked motion, and the iron-forge of the blacksmiths'.
