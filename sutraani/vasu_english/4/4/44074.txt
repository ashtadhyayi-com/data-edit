The ल् of ष्ठल् is for accent (VI. I. 193), the ष् is for ङीष् [[4.1.41]]. Thus आवसथे वसति = आवसथिकः 'who dwells in a house' i. e. a domestic person as opposed to an ascetic. The feminine will be आवसथिकी ॥ So far was the scope of ठक् as ordained in [[4.4.1]]. Henceforward other affixes will be ordained.
