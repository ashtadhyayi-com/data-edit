The word हृदयस्य is understood in the <i>sutra</i>. The word बन्धन gives the sense of the affix and is qualified by the word ऋषि ॥ That by which a thing is bound is called बन्धनं ॥ The word ऋषि means here the <i>Veda</i> or the Vedic bymn. Thus हृदयस्य बन्धनमृषि = हृ꣡द्यः 'the <i>Mantra</i> by which the heart of another can be brought under one's control', i.e. a वशीकरण मन्त्रः ॥
