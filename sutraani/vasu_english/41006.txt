And after what has an indicatory उक् (उ , ऋ or ऌ) the affix ङीप् is used denoting a feminine.
The उक् is a <i>pratyahara</i> meaning उ, ऋ and ऌ । Wherever it is possible to make these letters indicatory, in whatever way it may be, that word-form is called उगित् । That which ends with such a word is meant here. A <i>pratipadika</i> pure and simple, not formed by an affix, may be उगित्, thus the pronoun भवतु among the <i>sarvanamas</i>: an affix may be उगित् as the affixes क्तवतु and शतृ, and therefore, the words formed by these affixes will be उगित्; similarly a letter may be उगित् as तृ meaning त् in [[6.4.127]], ("तु is the substitute of the final of an inflective base ending in अर्वन् &c")

Thus, भवत् 'honored' sir.—f. भवती 'madam'. Applying the rule of <i>tadantavidhi</i>, we have अतिभवत्-अतिभवती 'most exalted lady'. Similarly पचत् (formed by adding शतृ [[3.2.124]]), forms the feminine पचन्ती, the नुम् comes by [[7.1.82]]. So also यजनी 'a female sacrificing'; अर्वत् अर्वती 'a mare'.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of verbal roots having an indicatory '<i>uk</i>'. Thus the roots स्रंसु 'to fall down', ध्वंसु 'to fall down' have indicatory उ; and we get from these roots, the <i>pratipadikas</i> like उखास्रत् and पर्णध्वत्,[[3.2.76]]. The उखास्रत् ब्राह्मणी, पर्णध्वत् ब्राह्मणी ॥ Here, the feminine is not formed by adding ङीप् ।

Vart:- The <i>pratipadikas</i> ending with the verb '<i>anchu</i>', however, take the affix ङीप् । As, प्राची, प्रती़ही, उदीची ॥
