The feminine affixes are not used after the stems called षद् -- ष्णान्ता षट् [[1.1.24]] and after स्वस्र etc.
This prohibits all feminine affixes that would otherwise have presented themselves. Thus पञ्च ब्राह्मण्यः 'the five <i>Brahmani</i> ladies'. So also सप्त, नव, दश &c are feminine as well as masculine. The following words belong to the <i>Svasradi</i> class:- स्वसा 'a sister', दुहिता 'a daughter'; ननान्दा 'a husband's sister', याता 'a husband's brother's wife', माता 'a mother', तिस्रः 'three'. चतस्रः 'four'.
