The affix ङीप् is not used when a तद्धित affix is elided after a द्विगु समास (Numeral Determinative Compound) ending in a word not denoting a mass or measure; or in 1. बिस्त 2. आचित or 3. कम्बल्य।
This debars 'nip' which otherwise would have presented itself by virtue of the last <i>sutra</i>. The words बिस्तः 'a weight of gold equal to 80 <i>Raktikas</i>', आचितम् 'a measure of 10 cart-loads or 80,000 <i>tolahs</i>'; and कम्बल्यः 'a measure', all denote measure; and are the only words expressing measure to which this rule applies. The word परिमाण means 'measure', as distinguished from संख्या 'a Numeral', See [[5.1.19]], &c.

Thus पञ्चाश्व is a <i>Dvigu</i> compound, meaning 'purchased for five horses.' Here the <i>Taddhita</i> affix ठञ् [[5.1.37]] giving the sense of 'purchased with' has been elided by [[5.1.28]]. This compound does not end in a word denoting <i>parimana</i> techincally so called or a measure. The feminine of this word will not be formed by ङीप् but by टाप्, thus, पञ्चश्वा 'a female purchased for five horses'.

The words denoting 'time' or 'number' are not words denoting 'measure' as understood in this <i>sutra</i> by the word '<i>parimana</i>'. Thus, द्विवर्षा, 'a two years old female child', त्रिवर्षा 'a three years old female child' (V. 2.37 <i>Vart</i>.) So also द्विशता 'a female purchased for two hundreds', similarly त्रिशता ॥ So also with the words बिस्त &c. As द्विबिस्ता 'purchased for two <i>bistas</i>', त्रिबिस्ता, द्व्याचिता, त्र्याचिता, द्विकम्बल्या, and त्रिकम्बल्या, &c.

Why do we say 'not ending in a word denoting a <i>Parimana</i> or a 'measure'? Observe द्व्याढकी, त्र्याढकी "a female purchased for two or three <i>adhaka</i>". Here <i>adhaka</i> means a measure equal to 7 Ib. II oz. avoir.

Why do we say 'when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is elided'? In '<i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i>' compounds, the affix '<i>nip</i>' will apply. Thus पञ्चाश्वी 'an aggregate of five horses', so also दशाश्वी ॥
