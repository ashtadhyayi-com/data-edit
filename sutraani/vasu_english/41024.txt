The affix ङीप् is not optionally used after a द्विगु समास (Numeral Determinative Compound) where the तद्धित affix is elided when the compound ends in the word पुरुष , referring to 'measure'.
Thus द्विपुरुषा or द्विपुरुषी परिखा 'a mote two <i>purusha</i> wide' so also त्रिपुरुषी or त्रिपुरुषा &c. The present <i>sutra</i> ordains an option where [[4.1.22]] would have made the prohibition universal. Why do we say 'when referring to measure'? Observe द्विपुरुषा 'a female purchased in exchange for two males'; No option is allowed here. Where the <i>Taddhita</i> affix is not elided, the present rule does not apply. Therefore in <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvigu</i> we have द्विपुरुषी or  त्रिपुरुषी ॥
