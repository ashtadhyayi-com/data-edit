The affix ङीप् comes in the feminine after a बहुव्रीहि समास beginning with a Numeral and ending with the words 1. दामन् 'a rope' and 2. हायन 'a year'.
The word दामन् was liable to be operated upon by three rules, by, [[4.1.13]] ordaining डाप्, by [[4.1.11]] prohibiting totally the affixing of ङीप् and [[4.1.28]] ordaining <i>nip</i> optionally : the present <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>nip</i> to the exclusion of all those rules. As द्विदाम्नी 'a (mare) bound by two ropes'. त्रिदाम्नी ॥

Similarly हायन would have taken long आ by [[4.1.4]], this ordains long ई ॥ Thus द्विहायनी 'two years (old girl)', त्रिहायणी; चतुर्हायणी ॥  

Vart:- The word '<i>hayana</i>' must denote 'age', for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i>. Therefore we have no <i>nip</i> here:-  द्विहायना शाला 'a hall of two years existence'. So also त्रिहायना and चतुर्हायना ॥ Moreover in these latter cases the न is not changed into ण; for when हायन denotes 'age', it is then only that the न is changed into ण and not otherwise.
