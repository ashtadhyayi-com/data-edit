The affix ङीप् comes after that बहुव्रीहि समास which ending in the syllable अन् loses its penultimate अ।
Thus बहुराजन् is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound ending in अन्; in applying <i>nip</i>, it loses is penultimate by [[6.4.134]] (अल्लोपोऽनः there is elision of अ of अन् when a <i>bha</i> affix follows). Thus बहुराज्ञी 'having many kings'. In the alternative, when <i>nip</i> is not added, we may add the affix डाप् by [[4.1.13]]. Thus बहुराजा, बहुराजे, बहुराजाः ॥ Or we may apply the prohibition contained in [[4.1.12]] and have बहुराजा, बहुराजानौ, बहुराजानः ॥ when the penultimate is not elided we cannot apply the affix ङीप् at all : in cases of such compounds there are only two forms of the feminine noun as सुपर्वा, सुपर्वे, सुपर्वाः or सुपर्वा सुपर्वाणौ, सुपर्वाणः ॥ That is to say we apply [[4.1.13]] and [[4.1.12]] only; for in the case of सुपर्वन् &c. rule [[6.4.137]] prevents the elision of the penultimate न्; (न संयोगाद्वमनन्तात्, there is not elision of the अ of अन् when it comes after a conjunct consonant ending in व or म)॥
