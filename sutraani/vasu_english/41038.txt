In forming the feminine with the affix ङीप् , औ is optionally the substitute of the final मनु (as well as the उदात्त ऐ).
The phrases ऐ and उदात्त are understood. The force of वा is to make the substitution optional. Thus we have three forms, मनायी or मनावी or मनुः, all meaning 'the wife of <i>Manu</i>'. The word मनु has <i>udatta</i> accent on the first vowel, as it is formed from मन् by the affix उ (<i>Un</i> l. 10), which by <i>Un</i> I.9 is treated as having an indicatory म्, and affixes having indicatory न् throw the accent on the first syllable.
