The affix ङीष् is used in the feminine after every other word expressive of colour and ending with an अनुदात्त accent.
The word वा of [[4.1.38]] does not govern this <i>sutra</i>. The word अन्यतः means in other cases than those governed by the last aphorism i.e. after words which have not त as penultimate. The difference between <i>nip</i> and <i>nish</i> affixes consists in accent, the former being gravely accented (111.1. 4) and the latter acute. Thus सारङ्गी, कल्माषी, शबली ॥

When the word does not express color, this rule does not apply. As खट्वा 'a bed-sted'.

When the word does not end with a gravely accented vowel, this will not apply, as, कृष्णा , कपिला ॥
