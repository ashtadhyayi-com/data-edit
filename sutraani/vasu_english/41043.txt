The affix ङीष् is used in the feminine according to the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians after the word शोण।
Thus शोणी or शोणा वडवा 'a red or bay mare'. By <i>Phit</i> <i>Sutra</i> II.10 referred to already in [[4.1.39]] the <i>udatta</i> in शोणा falls on the first syllable, and by [[4.1.40]] it would have taken ङीष् always; but the present <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>niyama</i> rule and restricts the application of ङीष् according to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians only, and not of others.
