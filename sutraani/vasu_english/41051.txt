The affix ङीष् is used after a compound प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) in which a name denoting the means herewith, is the first member and the second member is a word formed by the Particle क्त when the sense is that of 'a small quantity'. 
The word करण पूर्वात् 'preceded by a noun denoting the means where with', of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this also. The participle in क्त, must be preceded by a noun in the instrumental case, and the sense conveyed by क्त, to the action should give the sense of 'little', in connection therewith. The अल्पाख्यायाम् of the <i>sutra</i> qualifies the whole word. Thus अभ्रविलिप्ती द्यौः 'a sky covered slightly with clouds', सूपविलिप्ती पात्री 'a dish slightly covered with soup'.

Why do we say when the sense is that of 'little'? Observe चन्दनानुलिप्ता ब्राह्मणी "a <i>Brahmani</i> lady covered with sandal essence?"
