The affix ङीष् is used in the feminine after that बहुव्रीहि समास which ending with a word formed by the affix क्त has an acute accent on the last syllable.
The word क्तात् of the last aphorism governs this also. This <i>sutra</i> applies to those <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds in which the first member is a <i>svanga</i> word. But if the antecedent member is not a <i>svanga word</i>, then the application of the rule is optional. As शंखभिन्नी 'having a rent on the temporal bone', ऊरुभिन्नी 'having a rent on the thigh'. गलकोत्कृन्नी (गलमुत्कृत्तमस्या), केशलूनी ॥ By [[2.2.36]] <i> Vart </i> जातिकालसुखादिश्यः परवचनम्, the <i>Nishtha</i> stands in the second place, otherwise by [[2.2.36]] it ought to have formed the first member of the compound. The words शंख &c. are <i>jati</i> words, and by [[6.2.170]], the acute is on the final.

Why do we say "after a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound ?" Observe पादपतिता which is an Ablative <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound [[2.2.38]]. The compounding is by [[2.1.32]], and it has acute on the final by [[6.2.144]].

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the participle जात 'born', which is also acutely accented on the final. Thus दन्तजाता 'a female who has cut her teeth;' स्तनजाता 'a female whose breast has been developed'. See [[2.2.36]] <i>Vart</i>.

Vart:- In the case of words पाणिगृहीती &c, the affix is employed in certain senses only. Thus पाणिगृहीती 'a wife'; (अग्निसाक्षिकं यस्याः पाणिर्गृह्यते); but पाणिगृहीता 'a woman whose hands have been taken, but not before the sacred fire, a concubine &c.'

Vart:- Exception must be stated in the case of compounds, the antecedent member of which is any one of the following words :- बहु, नञ, सु, words denoting time, सुख &c. Thus बहुकृता, अकृता, सुकृता, मासजाता, संवत्सरजाता, सुखजाता or दुःखजाता &c.

<i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds get acute accent on the final syllable when they fall under the rules [[6.2.170]] and the following.
