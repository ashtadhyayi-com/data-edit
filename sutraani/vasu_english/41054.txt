And the feminine affix ङीष् comes optionally after what ends with the name of a part of the body when the word is a subordinate member in compound and has not a conjunct for its penultimate letter (i.e. the final अ is not preceded by a double consonant).
The <i>Anuvritti</i> of the words बहुव्रीहेः, क्तान्तादन्तोदात्तात् does not extend to this aphorism. But the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word वा 'optionally' does extend to this <i>Sutra</i>. Thus चन्द्रमुखी or चन्द्रमुखा, अतिकेशी or अतिकेशा ॥ The word अतिकेशा  is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound meaning अतिक्रान्ता केशान्, and केश is <i>upasarjana</i> by [[1.2.44]].

Why do we say "what ends with the name of a part of the body"? Observe बहुयवा 'having much barley'. Why do we say "subordinate in a compound"? Witness अशिखा "without crest" (where the शिखा is not subordinate or epithetical). Why do we say "not having a conjunct for its penultimate letter"? Witness सुगुल्फा, सुपार्श्वा ॥

Vart :- This rule applies to a compound ending with the word अङ्ग, गात्र and कण्ठ, though in all these, the penultimate is a double consonant. Thus मृद्वङ्गी or मृद्वङ्गा; सुगात्री or सुगात्रा, स्निग्धकण्ठी or स्निग्धकण्ठा ॥

The word स्वांग has a technical meaning as given in the following verse:-

अद्रवं मूर्तिमत्स्वाङ्गं प्राणिस्थमविकारजम् ।
अतत्स्थं तत्रदृष्टं चेत् तेन चेत् तत्तथायुतम् ॥

A word denoting a thing which not being a fluid, is capable of being perceived by the senses because of its having a form, is <i>svanga</i>; it must exist in a living being, but not produced by a change from the natural state; or though found elsewhere actually, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.
