The form दीर्घजिह्वी 'long-tongued' is irregularly formed in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
The word दीर्घजीह्वी is the feminine of दीर्घजीह्व but as the latter has a conjunct consonant for its penultimate, the feminine affix ङीष् would not have applied to it by [[4.1.54]]. The present aphorism enjoins ङीष् ॥ Thus दीर्घजीह्वी in the sentence दीर्घजीह्वी वै देवानां हव्यमलेट् ।

The word च 'and' in the aphorism is used in order to draw in the word संज्ञा from the last, so that the word <i>dirgha</i>-jihvi is always a Name. Moreover by using the feminine form <i>dirgha</i>-jihvi in the <i>sutra</i>, it is indicated that the application of ङीष् is necessary and not optional, as was the case in the last <i>sutras</i>.
