The feminine affix ङीप् comes after a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) which is preceded by a word signifying direction.
This aphorism over-rules all the rules and prohibitions contained in <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.54]] to [[4.1.58]]. Whereever by those rules there would have been ङीष्, the present enjoins ङीप् instead. Though the form will be the same, the difference will be in the accent; the affix ङीप् being <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]. Thus प्राङ्मुखी or प्राङ्मुखा, प्राङ्नासिकी or प्रांनासिका, But not so in प्राग्गुल्फा; प्राक्क्रोडा or प्राग्जघना because these words do not take ङीष् (by [[4.1.56]]), therefore they never give occasion to the application of ङीप् ॥ The <i>sutra</i> ought to be read as if it contained two rules (1) the affix ङीष् comes after a compound the first member of which is a word denoting direction and the second is a <i>svanga</i> word or is the word नासिका &c. the penultimate not being a conjunct consonant, (2) but ङीष् is not added to Compounds ending in क्रोड &c. or in a word of more than two syllables. In other words the <i>sutra</i> may be translated "ङीप् is the substitute of ङीष् when the first member is a word denoting direction". Therefore the affix ङीप् will come only there, where else the affix ङीष् would have come and not otherwise. This is the reason why the <i>anuvritti</i> of ङीष् is taken in the next <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.61]] and not that of ङीप् ॥
