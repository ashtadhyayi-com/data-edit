After a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) ending in short उ , not having the letter य् as its penultimate letter and being expressive of races of men, the affix in the feminine is ऊङ्।
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words मनुष्यजाति and अयोपधात् should be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete it. Thus कूरूः 'a female of the country of the <i>Kurus</i>' ब्रह्मबन्धूः "a <i>Brahmani</i> of the class of the fallen <i>Brahmans</i> so called", जीवबन्धूः "a woman of the <i>Jivabandhu</i> class".

Thus कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः [[4.1.172]], and this affix is elided by [[4.1.176]] in the feminine.

The indicatory letter ङ् in ऊङ् is to distinguish this affix in <i>Sutras</i> like नोङ् धात्वोः [[6.1.175]], for had the affix been enunciated merely as ऊ, then the <i>Sutra</i> [[6.1.175]] would have run as नो धात्वोः and the sense would have been ambiguous, for we could not have known what affix was particularly meant there.

The long ऊ is taught to debar the affix कप्, for a short उ would have also given the form करू (कुरु + उ = कुरू) ॥ The long ऊ therefore, indicates that the affix कप्, enjoined by [[5.4.154]], in <i>Bahuvrihis</i>, will not apply in the feminine forms ब्रह्मबन्धूः and the like, by the rule of <i>vipratishedha</i>.

Why do we say "not having the letter य् as its penultimate"? Witness अध्वर्युर्ब्राह्मणी 'a woman of the class of <i>Brahmanas</i> versed in the <i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i>'.

Vart:- The affix ऊङ् comes under similar conditions after words denoting non-animate <i>jati</i>, except the words रज्जु &c. Thus अलाबूः 'the bottle gourd'; कर्कन्धूः 'the jujube tree.' Why do we say "non-animate"? Witness कृकवाकुः 'a kind of lizard.' Why do we say "except the word <i>rajju</i> &c" Witness रज्जुः 'rope'; हनुः 'cheek' &c.
