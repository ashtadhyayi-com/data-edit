The feminine affix ऊङ् comes in denoting a Name after a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) ending with the word बाहु।
Thus भद्रबाहूः '<i>Bhadrabahu</i>'; जालबाहूः &c. Why do we say in "expressing a Name"? Observe वृत्तबाहूः 'a woman having rounded hand' which is an attributive word. In other words, when the compound is a name, बाहु takes long ऊ in the feminine.
