When the feminine affix ऊङ् comes after a stem ending in ऊरु when comparison with something (expressed by the first term) is meant.
Thus कदलास्तम्भोरूः 'a female with thighs like plantain-stem'. नागनासोरूः 'a female with thighs like the nose of an elephant';  करभोरूः 'female with thighs like the ulnar or tapering fleshy side of the hand'.

Why do we say "when expressing an object of comparison"? Witness वृत्तोरूः स्त्री 'a woman with round thighs'. The word करेणुकरोरु "thigh like the proboscis (कर)of an elephant (करेणु)" is a poetic irregularity in the following विचकरे च करेणुकरोरुभिः ॥
