The feminine affix ऊङ् comes in the छन्दस् (Vedas) after the word ऊरु when the words 1. संहित 'accompanied or joined' 2. शफ 'a hoof' 3. लक्षण 'a mark' 4. वाम 'handsome' precede it.
This aphorism applies, when no comparison is intended. As संहितोरूः 'a female whose thighs are joined (e.g. from obesity)' शफोरूः 'whose thighs are put together like the two hoofs on a cow's foot,' लक्षणोरूः 'whose thighs are marked,' वामोरूः 'with handsome thighs.'

Vart:- So also with the words सहित and सह. As सहितोरूः and सहोरूः ॥
