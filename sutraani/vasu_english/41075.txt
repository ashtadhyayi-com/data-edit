And the feminine affix चाप् comes after the word आवट्य।
The word अवट belongs to <i>Gargadi</i> class [[4.1.105]] which after taking यञ्, would have taken ङीप् [[4.1.16]]. Thus आवट्या 'a female descendant of <i>Avata</i>'. But आवट्यायनी will be the proper form according to the Eastern Grammarians. See aphorism [[4.1.17]].
