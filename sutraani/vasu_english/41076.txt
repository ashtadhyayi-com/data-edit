The तद्धित-affixes are treated of here after.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> or governing <i>sutra</i>. Up to the end of the Fifth Book, all the affixes that will be taught, are to be understood to have the name of <i>Taddhita</i>. Thus the affix ति taught in the very next <i>sutra</i>. As युवतिः The word so formed is called <i>Pratipadika</i>. The word तद्धिताः is in the  number, and not exhibited in the singular, like the words प्रत्ययः [[3.1.1]] &c; and it, therefore, indicates that it includes also affixes which are not especially taught in this book. Such as पृथिव्य ञाञौ॥ अग्रादि पश्चाड् डिमच् ॥ As पार्थिव, अग्रिम, आदिम, पश्चिम ॥ See <i>Vart</i> IV. 3.23. The word <i>Taddhita</i> is used in <i>Sutras</i> like कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च [[1.2.46]].
