In Patronymics used in narrower sense (counting first from the grand-child), which are formed the affixes अण् and इञ् , the feminine is formed by substituting य (ष्यङ्) for the अ and इ of those affixes and adding the long आ under -- यङश्चाप् [[4.1.74]], provided that they do not denote ऋषि clans and have prosodially long syllable preceding the last syllable.
The wording of this aphorism requires a little analysis. It consists of five words: (1) अणिञोः 'of अण् and इञ्' (2) अनार्षयोः 'of non-<i>rishi</i>' (3) गुरूपोत्तमयोः 'having a heavy vowel as <i>upottama</i> i. e. last but one,' (4) ष्यङ 'the substitute is <i>shyan</i>' (5) गोत्रे 'in denoting <i>gotra</i>.' That is to say, the <i>gotra</i> affixes अण् and इञ् are replaced by ष्यङ् before the feminine affix चाप्, in those words which denoting non-<i>rishi</i> <i>gotras</i>, have a heavy vowel as last but one. The word <i>uttama</i> meaning last letter, being formed by the superlative affix <i>tamap</i>, implies that the word must be of at least three syllables. Therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> does not apply to forms like दाक्षि &c.

Of the substitute ष्यङ् the letter ष् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is य, the letter ष् differentiating this affix from ञ्यङ् and the letter ङ् affording a common hold for both. In forming the feminine we shall have to add चाप् by [[4.1.74]]. Thus करीषगन्धि 'having the smell of dung-cake', is the name of a person. In forming a patronymic from this word, we add the affix अण् ॥ Thus करीषगन्धि + अण् [[4.1.92]] Replace this affix by ष्य and we have कारीषगन्ध्या ॥ कुमुदगन्धि  gives us कौमुदगन्ध्या ॥ Similarly with words taking the affix इञ् (as taught in <i>sutra</i> अतइञ् [[4.1.75]]: as वाराहिः gives us वाराह्या, so also बालाक्या ॥

Why do we say 'of अण् and इञ् ॥ Witness आर्तभागा from ऋतभाग ॥ Here the word ऋतभाग belongs to बिदादि  <i>gana</i>, and therefore by [[4.1.104]], it would take the affix अञ् in forming <i>gotra</i> patronymic: this affix अञ् is not replaced by ष्यङ्, and the feminine is by long ई [[4.1.15]]; for though, its last vowel but one is heavy, it is a non-<i>rishi</i> <i>gotra</i> word, yet it does not fulfil the other condition of taking the affix अण् or इञ् ॥

Why do we say 'of non-<i> rishi</i> <i>gotras</i>'? Witness वासिष्ठी and वैश्वामित्री ॥ Why do we say 'whose last vowel but one is heavy'? Observe औपगवी and कापटवी ॥ Why do we say 'denoting <i>Gotra</i>?' Witness आहिच्छत्री 'born in <i>Ahichhatra</i>', कान्यकुब्जी 'born in <i>Kanyakubja</i>'.
