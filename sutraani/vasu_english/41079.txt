After a word denoting a non-principal गोत्र , ष्यङ् is the substitute of अण् and इञ् , the feminine, even though the syllable preceding the final be not prosodially long.
The phrase अणिञोः of the last <i>sutra</i> governs this also, not so, however, the word अगरूपोत्तमः ॥ The phrase गोत्रावयव means insignificant or non-famous <i>gotras</i>. i. e. names of <i>kulas</i> i. e. कुलाख्या, such as families like पुणिक, भुणिक, मुखर which are not famous and are not included in the <i>gotra</i> list. Thus पौणिक्या, भौणिक्या and मौखर्या ॥

The word अवयव in the <i>sutra</i> has various significations, one sense being 'separate from', another being 'part of', and 'individual members' &c. If the last sense be taken, then we can evolve forms like दैवदत्त्या याज्ञदत्या ॥ These forms may also be explained by taking them as belonging to the कौड्यादि class of the next aphorism. In short, those who wish to apply this aphorism to 'the immediate descendant', such as 'the son or daughter', and not to a <i>gotra</i> descendant, which means a grandson and down; can also do so.

In fact the word गोत्रावयव is equal to अवयवगोत्र or अप्रधानगोत्र and is a <i>karmadharaya</i> <i>samasa</i>, namely <i>gotras</i> not enumerated in the प्रवराध्यायः ॥ These are, however technically called कुल ॥
