The affix ष्यङ् optionally comes after the words 1. दैवयज्ञि 2. शौचिवृक्षि 3. सात्यमुग्रि and 4. काण्ठेविद्धि ।
These words end in the affix इञ्, and the word <i>gotra</i> is not understood in the <i>sutra</i>. In the case of <i>gotra</i> descendants, the substitute <i>shyan</i> would have come by [[4.1.78]] but whereas by that <i>sutra</i> it would have been compulsory, the present aphorism makes it optional. But if the <i>sutra</i> be taken to apply to 'immediate descendants' as opposed to <i>gotra</i> descendants, then this is a new rule altogether and not a rider to [[4.1.87]]. In the alternative when ष्यङ् is not added, ङीष् will be added by rule [[4.1.65]] <i>ante</i>. Thus दैवयज्ञ्याor दैवयज्ञी, so also शौचिवृक्ष्या or शौचिवृक्षी, सात्यमुग्र्या or सात्यमुग्री, काण्ठेविद्ध्या or काण्ठेविद्धी ॥
