The affix अण् mentioned in प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] and those which follow it denote 'the descendant of someone'.
This <i>sutra</i> points out the meaning of the affixes; and it refers to the affixes that have preceded, beginning from अण् [[4.1.83]] e. g. अण्, ण्य, अञ् &c and to the affixes that follow. The affixes herein taught have the force of denoting descendant, when they are added to the word in construction which is in the genitive case. The translation given by Dr. Ballantyne of this aphorism is :- "Let the affixes already mentioned or to be mentioned come optionally in the sense of the offspring thereof, after what word ending with the sixth case-affix and having completed its junction (with whatever it may require to be compounded with), is in grammatical relation there to".
Thus we may either use the sentence उपगोरपत्यम्; or by adding आण् [[4.1.83]] to the word उपगु (which has the 6th. case-affix in construction in the above sentence), form औपगवः "the offspring of <i>Upagu</i>". आश्वपतः [[4.1.84]] 'the offspring of अश्वपति', दैत्यः [[4.1.85]] 'the offspring of <i>Diti</i>' औत्सः [[4.1.86]] "the offspring of <i>Utsa</i>". स्त्रैणः [[4.1.87]] 'the offspring of a woman'. पौस्नः [[4.1.87]] 'the offspring of a man'. 

The Universal <i>sutra</i> तस्येदम् [[4.3.120]] will include this अपत्य also for the word इदम् may be applied to any-thing like अपत्यं, समूहः, विकारः, निवासः &c. Since by that rule [[4.3.120]] अण् &c, may be applied in the sense of <i>apatyam</i> also, what is the necessity of this present <i>sutra</i> ? The present <i>sutra</i> is made in order to debar those affixes like छ, [[4.3.114]] which debar the affix अण् &c in the case of तस्येदम् ॥ How can an अशैषिक affix debar a शैषिक affix? The उत्सर्ग affixes अण् &c are treated like शैषिक for this purpose. Thus these affixes अण् [[4.1.83]]- [[4.1.87]] debar the छ in the <i>Vriddham</i> under certain circumstances. Thus भानोरपत्यं = भानवः, so also श्यामगवः from श्यामगुः (श्यामा गावोऽस्य) ॥
