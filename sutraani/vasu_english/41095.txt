The affix affix इञ् after a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) which ends in short अ , in denoting a descendant.
This debars अण् [[4.1.83]]. Thus दक्षस्यापत्यं = दाक्षिः 'descendant of <i>Daksha</i>'. Why do we say short अ (for this is the force of the letter त् added to अ, by [[1.1.69]] and [[1.1.70]]? The descendant of शुभंयाः or कीलालपाः (words which end in long आ) will not be formed by the affix इञ् ॥

The descendant of दशरथ by this <i>sutra</i> is दाशरथिः, but the form दाशरथ formed by अण् is also met with. As "प्रदीयताम् दाशरथाय मैथिली" 'Give <i>Sita</i> to the son of <i>Dasaratha</i>.'
