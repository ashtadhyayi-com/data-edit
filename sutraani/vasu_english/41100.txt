The affix फक् comes after the words हरित etc. when they end in the affix अञ् -- अनृष्यानन्तर्ये बिदादिभ्योऽञ् [[4.1.104]]
The words हरित &c, form a subdivision of बिद class, which class by [[4.1.104]] takes the affix अञ् in forming <i>Gotra</i> words. Thus the <i>Gotra</i> descendant of हरित will be हारित (हरित + अञ्). The son of हारित will be formed by this <i>sutra</i> and not by [[4.1.95]]. Thus हारित + फक् = हारितायनः "the son of <i>Harita</i> or the great-grandson of <i>Harita</i>". In fact, the force of the affix फक् of this <i>Sutra</i> is that of a <i>Yuvan</i> affix, though it is taught in the chapter of <i>Gotra</i> affixes; because according to the general rule [[4.1.98]] one <i>Gotra</i> affix can be only added to a word, and the word हारित that being already formed by a <i>Gotra</i> affix अञ् will not take again another <i>Gotra</i> affix फक् ॥ Therefore, फक् as is here a <i>Yuvan</i>-affix.
