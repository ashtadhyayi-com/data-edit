The affix फक् comes in the sense of a गोत्र (Patronymic) descendant, optionally after the words 1. द्रोण 2. पर्वत and 3. जीवन्त।
This debars इञ् of [[4.1.95]]. Thus द्रौणायनः or द्रौणिः, पार्वतायनः or पार्वतिः जैवन्तायनः or जैवन्तिः ॥

The affix फक् is employed in denoting a remote (<i>gotra</i>) offspring and not an immediate descendant or son. How is then अश्वत्थामा the son of <i>Drona</i>, called द्रौणायनः and not द्रौणिः in the phrase "अश्वत्थामा द्रौणायनः"? The द्रोण here does not refer to the <i>Drona</i> of the <i>Mahabharat</i>, but to some ancient founder of a clan of that name, and his descendants were called द्रौणायनाः ॥ In modern times, by an easy error, <i>Asvatthama</i> was called <i>Draunayana</i>, owing to the similarity of sounds.
