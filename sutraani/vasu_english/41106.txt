The affix यञ् comes, in the sense of a गोत्र (Patronymic) descendant after the words 1. मधु and 2. बभ्रु when the words so formed mean ब्राह्मण and कौशिक respectively.
Thus माधव्यः = ब्राह्मणः '<i>Brahmana</i>.' Otherwise माधवः "son of <i>Madhu</i>." बाभ्रव्यः = कौशिकः Otherwise बाभ्रवः ॥

The word बभ्रु belongs to the <i>Gargadi</i> class, so it would have taken <i>yan</i> by the last <i>sutra</i> also. The present <i>sutra</i> declares a restriction, viz. बभ्रु takes यञ् only then when कौशिक is denoted. Its being read in the <i>Gargadi</i> class serves another purpose : as it belongs to the sub-class लोहितादि, the rule [[4.1.18]] becomes applicable to it; so that its feminine is formed by ष्फ. Thus बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥ In fact, it would have been better, if in the body of the <i>Ganapatha</i>, instead of writing बभ्रु alone, there was बभ्रु कौशिके ॥ It would have saved the repetition of it in the present <i>sutra</i>.
