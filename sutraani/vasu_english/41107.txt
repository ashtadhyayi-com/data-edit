The affix यञ् comes in the sense of a गोत्र (Patronymic) descendant after the words 1. कपिand 2. बोध when the special descendants of the family of अङ्गिरस are meant.
Thus कपि + यञ् = काप्यः 'the grand-son or a still lower descendant of '<i>Kapi</i>' of the family of <i>Angiras</i>.' So also बौध्यः ॥

Why do we say of the family of <i>Angiras</i> ? Observe कापेयः [[4.1.122]] "the <i>gotra</i>-descendant of <i>Kapi</i>" so also बौधिः formed by इञ् because it is a Non-<i>Rishi</i> word or because it belongs to <i>Bahvadi</i> [[4.1.96]] class.

The word कपि occurs in <i>Gargadi</i> class. The present <i>sutra</i> declares a restriction i. e. the '<i>yan</i>' is to be applied only when <i>Angirasa</i> descendant is meant. It is included in the <i>Gargadi</i> class also for the purpose of applying [[4.1.18]]. Thus काप्यायनी "grand-daughter or a still lower descendant of <i>Kapi</i>."
