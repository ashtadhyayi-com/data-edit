The affix अण् comes in the sense of descendant after प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) denoting the name of a ऋषि or the name of a person of the family of 1. अन्धक 2. वृष्णि 3. कुरु।
This debars the affix इञ् ॥ The <i>Rishis</i> are like <i>Vasishtha</i>, <i>Visvamitra</i> &c. Thus वासिष्ठः, वैश्वामित्रः ॥ So also श्वाफल्कः, रान्धसः being persons belonging to the family of <i>Andhaka</i>; and वासुदेवः, आनुरुद्धः being persons belonging to the family of <i>Vrishni</i>, and नकुलः, साहदेवः being persons belonging to the family of <i>Kuru</i>.

The word अत्रि is the name of a <i>Rishi</i>, in forming its Patronymic, the present <i>sutra</i> enjoins अण्; but [[4.1.122]] enjoins ढक्; thus there being a conflict, we apply the maxim of interpretation contained in (1.4. 2). So that the Patronymic or अत्रि will be formed not by अण् but by ढक् ॥ Thus आत्रेयः ॥ Similarly उग्रसेन a person of <i>Andhaka</i> family, forms its patronymic औग्रसेन्यः [[4.1.152]] by ण्य; and not by अण्, so also वैष्वकसेन्य 'son of <i>Vaishvaksena</i>' a person of <i>Vrishni</i>, family; so also भैमसेन्यः 'son of <i>Bhimasena</i>' a person of <i>Kuru</i> family.

Note.- The words or <i>sabdas</i> are eternal; how is it that rules applying to them should be made dependant upon their occurring in particular families or not, when families themselves are non-eternal? In other word, how a rule affecting a permanent object is conditioned by an impermanent adjunct? To this, some reply that <i>Panini</i> has by mere coincidence (and not as cause and effect) classified certain definite number of words as belonging to certain families, and then the rule made applicable to them. Moreover a permanent object is sometimes designated by an impermanent object : as the permanent time is designated by the name of <i>Saka</i>. Others say that the families of <i>Andhaka</i> &c., are also permanent, and the words '<i>Nakula</i>' '<i>Sahadeva</i>' &c., found therein are, of course, permanent.
