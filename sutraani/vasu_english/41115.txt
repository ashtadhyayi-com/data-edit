The affix अण् comes in the sense of descendant after the word मातृ when it is preceded by a Numeral or by the words सम् or भद्र and the letter उ is substituted for the final ऋ of मातृ।
Thus from द्विमातृ we have द्वैमातुरः "son of two mothers i.e. son of one and adopted by another." द्विमातृ + अण् = द्वैमात् + उ + अ = द्वैमात् + उ + र् + अ (I.I.51.) Similarly षाण्मातुरः, सांमातुरः, and भाद्रमातुरः ॥

This <i>sutra</i> is made in order to teach the substitution of short उ for ऋ of मातृ; for the word मातृ would have taken the affix अण् by the general rule [[4.1.83]]. The <i>sutra</i> contains the word पूर्वायाः in the feminine gender, showing by implication that the rule applies where the word मातृ denotes female. Thus संमिमीते = संमातृ 'he who measures together'. Its patronymic will be सांमात्रः 'son of a fellow-measurer'; because here the word मातृ does not mean 'mother', but a 'measure'. Nor the word धान्यमातृ 'barley measurer' will be affected by this rule. Why do we say "when preceded by a Numeral &c." Observe सौमात्रः 'son of <i>Sumatri</i>'. The word वैमात्रेयः is formed by [[4.1.123]] as belonging to <i>Subhradi</i> class.
