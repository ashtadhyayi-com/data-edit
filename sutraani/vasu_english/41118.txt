The affix अण् comes optionally after the word पीला in denoting a descendant.
The word पीला being the name of a female would have taken अण् by [[4.1.113]]; but this अण् would have been prohibited by [[4.1.121]] as it is a dissyllabic feminine word. Hence the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i>. Thus पैलः or पैलेयः 'son of <i>Pila</i>.'
