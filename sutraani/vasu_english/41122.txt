The affix ढक् comes in the sense of a descendant after a disyllabic प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) ending in short इ , but not, however after a word ending in the Patronymic affix इञ्।
The <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>stri</i>' does not extend to this aphorism. The force of the word च in the <i>sutra</i> is to draw the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word द्व्यचः of the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus आत्रेयः 'the son of <i>Atri</i>'. नैधेयः 'the son of निधिः' ।

Why do we say "after a word ending in short इ"? Observe दाक्षिः "son of दक्ष" ॥ Here दक्ष though a dissyllabic word, yet ends in अ ॥

Why do we say 'not ending in the patronymic affix इञ्'? Observe दाक्षायणः 'son of दाक्षि' ॥ Here though दाक्षि is a dissyllabic word ending in short इ, it does not take the affix ढक् for इ here is the affix इञ् [[4.1.95]]; so also प्लाक्षायनः ॥ Why do we say 'having two vowels'? Observe मारीचः "son of मरीचिः"
