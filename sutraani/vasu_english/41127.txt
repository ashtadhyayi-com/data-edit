The affix ढक् comes in the sense of a descendant after the word कुल्टा and इनङ् is optionally the substitute of the final before this affix.
The word कुलटा means literally one who wanders (अटति) from one family (कुल) to another, i.e. an unchaste woman. This <i>sutra</i> is made to teach substitution only, for कुलटा would have taken ढक् by the general rule [[4.1.120]]. Thus कुलटा + ढक् = कुलटिन् + ढक् = कौलटिनेयः or कौलटेयः 'son of an unchaste woman.' This word कुलटा being a word denoting contempt, will take also the affix ढक् by [[4.1.131]]. Thus कौलटेरः ॥
