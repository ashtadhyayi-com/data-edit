The affix ढ्रक् comes in the sense of a descendant after the word गोधा।
Thus गोधा + ढ्रक् = गौधेरः ॥ Of the affix '<i>dhrak</i>', the letter ढ् is replaced by एय् [[7.1.2]], क् causes <i>Vriddhi</i> [[7.2.118]] and makes the <i>udatta</i> accent fall on the final [[4.1.165]]. Thus the real affix is एय्र, but the य् is elided by [[6.1.66]] and so the affix that is actually added is एर ॥

This word गोधा occurs in the <i>Subhradi</i> class [[4.1.123]], also, thus it takes the affix '<i>dhak</i>' as well. Thus गौधेयः ॥
