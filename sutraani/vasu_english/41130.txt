The affix आरक् comes in the sense of a descendant after the word गोधा according to the opinion of Northern Grammarians.
Thus गौधारः ॥ It might be objected that the आरक् contains the letter आ unnecessarily, for रक् would have served the purpose as well, because गोधा ends in long आ already. The objection is valid in the case of गोधा, but the very fact that <i>Panini</i> uses this affix आरक्, shows by implication, that there are other words also which take this affix, and in whose case the affix रक् would not suffice. Thus the words जड and पण्ड also take this affix, as जाडारः, पाण्डारः ॥ The mention of the name of Northern Grammarians is for the sake of showing respect only.
