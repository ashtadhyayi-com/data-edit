The affix ढ्रक् comes optionally in the sense of descendant after the feminine words denoting mean objects.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of ढ्रक् is to be read in this <i>sutra</i>, and not of आरक्, though the latter immediately precedes it. The word क्षुद्रा means those who are defective or wanting in any bodily limb or organ, or who are low in social status and religious principles. This <i>sutra</i> debars ढक् which would come in the other alternative. Thus काणेरः 'the son of an one eyed woman', or काणेयः, दासेरः or दासेयः 'son of a female-slave'.
