The affix यत् comes in the sense of the descendant after the words राजन् and श्वसुर।
This debars अण् and अञ् respectively. Thus राजन्यः [[4.4.168]] 'a person of <i>Kshatriya</i> class'. This is the special meaning of the word; it does not mean 'the son of a <i>Raja</i>.' The word राजनः will mean 'the son of a King.' So also श्वशुरर्यः 'son of the father-in-in-law.'
