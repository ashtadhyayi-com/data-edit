The affixes यत् and ढकञ् come optionally after the word कुल when it is not preceded by any other word which gets the designation of पद -- सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् [[1.4.14]].
The word अपूर्वपद means when the word '<i>kula</i>' is not the last member of a compound. Thus कुल्यः , कौलेयकः ॥ By the use of the word 'optionally,' we get the affix ख also. Thus कुलीनः ॥ The word कु꣡ल्यः has <i>udatta</i> on the first syllable [[6.1.213]].

The word पद has been defined in (l. 4.14). The word बहु is not a <i>pada</i>. Therefore बहुकुल will take these affixes. Thus बहुकुल्यः , बाहुकुलेयकः and बहुकुलीनः ॥
