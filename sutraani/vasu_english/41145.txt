The affix व्यत् comes after the word भ्रातृ when the sense is that of 'an enemy'.
The word सपत्न means 'enemy'. The sense of descendant is not connoted by this affix. The difference between व्यन् and व्यत् is in accent [[6.1.185]] and [[6.1.197]]. Thus पाप्मना भ्रातृव्येण "by the sinful enemy". भ्रातृव्यः कण्टकः "the enemy is a thorn".
