And when contempt is to be expressed, the affix ण comes in the sense of descendant after a feminine word denoting a गोत्र-descendant.
By the force of the word च in the <i>sutra</i> we get the affix ठक् also. When one's father is not known, and he is called by a name derived from his mother, it casts a slur upon his legitimacy; hence such an epithet is a कुत्सा or 'a defamatory or contemptuons epithet'. Thus गार्गी is a female <i>gotra</i>-descendant. Her son will be called गार्गः, as गार्गः जाल्मः ॥ So also गार्गिकः ॥ Similarly the son of ग्लुचुकायनी will be ग्लौचुकायनः and ग्लौचुकायनिकः ॥

This affix being added to a <i>Gotra</i> word has the force of a <i>Yuvan</i> affix.

Why do we say 'a <i>Gotra</i> descendant'. Observe कारिकेयो जाल्मः (formed by ढक् [[4.1.120]]). Why do we say 'female descendant'? Observe औपगवि जाल्मः ॥ Why do we say 'when contempt is meant'? Observe गार्गेयो माणवकः which is to be explained as गार्ग्या अपत्यं पुमान् युवा भवति ॥ मातामहादेरुपलक्षणार्थोयं प्रयोग इति नास्ति कुत्सा ॥
