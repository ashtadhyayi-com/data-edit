According to the opinion of Northern Grammarians, the affix इञ् comes in the sense of descendant after the words ending in सेना , the word लक्षण and words expressing artisans.
Thus कारिषेणिः, हारिषेणिः, लाक्षणिः, तान्तुवायिः, कौम्भकारिः ॥  As to the word तक्ष्ण 'carpenter.' See [[4.1.112]]. It will have ताक्ष्णः and ताक्ष्ण्यः, but will not take इञ् ॥ The word नापित being a <i>Vriddha</i>, non-<i>gotra</i> word, will take फिञ् under [[4.1.157]] according to the Northern Grammarians, as नापितायनिः ॥
