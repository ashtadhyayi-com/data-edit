The augment कुक् optionally comes after a stem ending with the word पुत्र when the Patronymic affix फिन् follows.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the words "according to the opinion of Northern Grammarians when the word has a <i>Vriddhi</i> in the first syllable" must be read into this <i>sutra</i>. Of course, a word ending in पुत्र cannot be a <i>Gotra</i>-word, for a <i>Gotra</i> word means a grandson or a still lower descendant. Hence a word ending in पुत्र having <i>Vriddhi</i> in the first syllable will take the affix फिञ् by [[4.1.157]]; the present aphorism only rules that it takes the augment कुक् optionally.

Thus we have three forms :- गार्गीपुत्रकायणिः or गार्गीपुत्रायणिः or गार्गीपुत्रिः ॥ So also वात्सीपुत्रकायणिः, वात्सीपुत्रायणिः and वात्सीपुत्रिः ॥
