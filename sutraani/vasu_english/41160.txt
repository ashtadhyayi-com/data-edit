According to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians after a stem not having वृद्धि vowel in the first syllable, the affix फिन् is diversely used in the sense of a descendant.
Thus ग्लुचुकायनिः or ग्लौचुकिः 'son of <i>Gluchuka</i>', ॥ अहिचुम्बकायनिः or आहिचुम्बिः ॥ Why do we say, "not having a <i>Vriddhi</i> in the first syllable", Observe राजदन्तिः ॥ The words प्राचाम्, बहुलं and अन्यतरस्याम् all denote optional rules, so the employment of any one of them would have here sufficed. Why two are used in this <i>sutra</i> viz.  प्राचां and बहुलं ? The mention of Grammarians is made as a token of respect, and बहुलं is used to express the non-uniformity of the <i>sutra</i> construction. In some places this affix फिन् is not at all added, as दाक्षिः, प्लाक्षिः ॥
