A descendant being a grandson or a still lower offspring is called गोत्र।
When an offspring, with reference to a person, is the son's son of that person or lower than that, it is called <i>Gotra</i>. Thus the son of '<i>Garga</i>' will be गार्गिः, and the son or grandsons &c of गार्गिः with reference to <i>Garga</i> will be गार्ग्यः ॥ Similarly वात्स्यः ॥

Why do we say 'a grandson or a still lower descendant'? The immediate descendants or the son will not be called <i>Gotra</i>. Thus कौञ्जिः, गार्गिः ॥
