But when one in a line of descent beginning with a father (and reckoning upwards) is alive, the descendant of a grandson or still lower descendant is called युवन् only.
The word वंश means an uninterrupted series of family descent-or 'a line'. One who occurs in such a line, like father &c, is called वंश्य ॥ When such a <i>vansya</i> is alive, then the descendant of a grandson &c is called <i>Yuvan</i>. The phrase पौत्रप्रभृतपत्य in the <i>sutra</i> should be construed as पौत्रप्रभृतेर् यद् अपत्यम्. 'He who is the descendant of a grandson &c' In the last <i>sutra</i>, however, this phrase पौत्रप्रभृत्यपत्यं was properly construed by putting the word पौत्रप्रभृति in the case of apposition with अपत्यम् meaning "a descendant being a grandson &c." Thus the word <i>Yuvan</i> will be applied to a person who is at least fourth in the order of descent, from the propositus with reference to whom the derivative is made. Thus गर्गः being the head, we have गर्गः

-	अपत्यम् - गार्गिः (son or <i>putra</i>)
-	अपत्यम् - गार्ग्यः (<i>Gotra</i>)
-	अपत्यम् - गार्ग्यायणः (<i>Yuvan</i>)

(if <i>Garga</i> or <i>Gargi</i> &c be alive). The force of the word तु, in the <i>sutra</i> is that it will be called <i>Yuvan</i> only, and not <i>Gotra</i> as well.
