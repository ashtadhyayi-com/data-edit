The living descendant of a grandson etc. is called optionally a युवन् when a more superior सपिण्ड other than a brother is alive.
The <i>sapinda</i> relationship extends up to seven degrees. The word स्थविर means 'superior', and स्थविरतर is comparative and means 'more superior', that is to say, superior both by degree of descent and by age. The word जीवति is again read in this aphorism, though there is the <i>anuvritti</i> of जीवति also from [[4.1.163]]. This जीवति of the <i>sutra</i> qualifies the word descendant, the जीवति which is understood by context qualifies the word <i>sapinda</i> thus :-

-	<i>Garga</i> (dead) -> <i>Gargi</i> (alive)
-	<i>Garga</i> (dead) -> <i>Gargi</i> (alive) -> <i>Gargya</i> (alive)
-	<i>Garga</i> (dead) -> <i>Gargi</i> (alive) -> <i>Gargya</i> (dead) -> <i>Gargyayna</i>) or <i>Gargya</i> (alive)

Here the uncle or the brother of a grand-father being alive, the descendant is optionally called <i>Yuvan</i> or <i>Gotra</i>.
