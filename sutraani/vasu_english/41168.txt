The affix अञ् comes in the sense of descendant after a word which while denoting a country, expresses also a tribe of क्षत्रिय-s.
Thus पाञ्चालः 'the son of <i>Panchala</i>', so also ऐक्ष्वाकः and वैदेहः are <i>Kshatriyas</i> who live in that country. Of course, when the word is only expressive of <i>Kshatriya</i>, but not of the name of a country, अञ् will not be used but अण्, the difference being in the accent. Thus द्रौह्यवः 'the son of '<i>Druhya</i>'; पौरवः 'the son of <i>Puru</i>.' Why do we say when it expresses <i>Kshatriyas</i>? Observe ब्राह्मणस्य पञ्चालस्यापत्यं = पाञ्चालिः, [[4.1.95]] 'the son of <i>Panchala</i> a <i>Brahmana</i>'; so also वैदेहिः ॥

Vart:- Let the same affix, which comes when the sense is that of the progeny, be added to a word denoting a country named after <i>Kshatriyas</i>, to denote the king thereof. Thus पंचालानाम् राजा = पाञ्चालः 'the king of the <i>Kshatriyas</i> called <i>Panchala</i> or of the country of <i>Panchalas</i>'. So also वैदेहः, 'the king of the <i>Kshatriyas</i> or of the country of <i>Videha</i>'.

The words <i>Panchala</i> &c. originally are names of <i>Kshatriya</i> tribes only, secondarily they have been applied to the country inhabited by those tribes, because the <i>Taddhita</i> affix denoting 'the country inhabited by them', is elided by [[4.2.81]]. Thus the same word पञ्चाल comes to denote the <i>Kshatriya</i> tribe as well as the country called <i>Panchala</i>. It will make practically little difference to consider words like <i>Panchala</i> &c. as original (not derivative) name of countries as well as of <i>Kshatriyas</i>. In fact, <i>Panini</i> himself considers them in the same light in this <i>sutra</i>, and does not think them to be derivative words, in spite of his own <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.81]]. Those words when denoting a country are always in the plural, as पञ्चालाः, in denoting the <i>Kshatriya</i>, they are in the singular.
