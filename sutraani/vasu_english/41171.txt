The affix ञ्यङ् comes in the sense of descendant after a word having वृद्धि in the first syllable and after a word ending in short इ and after the words 1. कोसल and 2. अजाद when they are the names of countries and क्षत्रिय-s.
This debars अञ् ॥ Thus, to give example of <i>Vriddha</i> words, आम्बष्ठ्यः सौवीर्यः 'the sons or kings of <i>Ambashtha</i> and <i>Sauvira</i>'. Similarly to take words ending in short इ, we have आवन्त्यः and कौन्त्यः 'the son or kings of <i>Avanti</i> and <i>Kunti</i>'. These are words ending in short इ ॥ So also कौसल्यः and आजाद्यः, which are neither <i>Vriddhas</i> nor end in short इ ॥

Vart:- The affix '<i>dyan</i>' comes after the word '<i>Pandu</i>' when it is the name of a country as well as  <i>Kshatriya</i> tribe. Thus पांड्यः, otherwise it will be पांडवः ॥ See [[4.1.74]].
