The affix above ordained is elided by लुप् when there is no specification.
That is the affix enjoined by the preceding aphorism is elided if no specification is to be understood of a particular portion of time such as night &c. Thus अद्यः पुष्यः 'to day belongs to the asterism <i>Pushya</i>' meaning that to-day the moon is in conjunction with <i>Pushya</i>; but by 'to-day' neither the day time in particular nor the night time in particular is meant, but both alike. The time is day and night, when there is no specification of such time, whether it is day or night, then there is elision.
