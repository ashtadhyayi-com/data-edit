The affix above ordained is elided by लुप् after the words 1. श्रवण and 2. अश्वथ when the whole word so formed is an appellation and there is specification of time.
Thus श्रवणा रात्रिः, अश्वत्थो मुहूर्तः "the night called <i>Sravana</i>; the <i>Muhurta</i> called <i>Asvattha</i>". The affix being elided by '<i>lup</i>', why should not [[1.2.51]] apply here? We should say श्रवणा रात्रिः and not श्चवण रात्रिः The reason is that श्रवणा is an irregularly formed word, as <i>Panini</i> himself uses it in <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.23]]. Why do we say 'when it is a Name or <i>Sanjna</i>'? Observe श्रावणी or आश्वत्थी रात्रिः ।
