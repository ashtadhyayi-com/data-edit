The affix छ comes after the द्वन्द compound of the names of lunar mansions, when it is in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction, to signify time connected with the asterism whether there be a specification or not.
Thus राधानुराधीया रात्रिः, तिष्यपुनर्वसवीयमहः ॥ So also when there is no specification : as अद्य राधानुराधीयम्, अद्य तिष्यपुनर्वसवीयम् ॥ The affix here in these two last cases is not elided, though there is no specification of time, because the present <i>sutra</i>, being a subsequent <i>sutra</i>, will debar [[4.2.4]] which ordains <i>lup</i> [[1.4.2]].
