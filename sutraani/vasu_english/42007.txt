The affix अण् -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] comes after a word in construction in the Instrumental -3rd case, in the sense of seen - the thing seen by the one whose name is in the Instrumental -3rd case, being the साम वेद।
Thus क्रुञ्चेन दृष्टं = क्रौञ्चं साम "the portion of the <i>Sama</i> seen by (or revealed to) <i>Kruncha</i>." So also वासिष्ठम्, वैश्वामित्रम् ॥
