The affix अञ् comes after the words द्वैप and वैयाघ्र being in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction in the sense of 'surrounded' the thing so surrounded being 'a chariot'.
Thus द्वैपेन परिवृतो रथः = दैपः 'a car covered with a tiger's skin'. So also वैयाघ्रः ॥ This affix अञ् debars अण्, the difference between these two being in accent only.
