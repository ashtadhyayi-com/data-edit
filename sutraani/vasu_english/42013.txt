The word कौमार is irregularly formed by adding the affix अण् when meaning 'virginity'.
<i>Karika</i>
कौमारापूर्ववचने कुमार्या अण्विधीयते ।  
अपूर्वत्वं यदा तस्याः कुमार्या भवतीतिवा ॥

Thus कौमारो भर्ता = अपूर्वपतिं कुमारीमुपपन्नः 'the husband of a virgin'. i. e. one whose wife was given to him in marriage while she was a maid (not a widow). So also कौमारी भार्या = कुमारी अपूर्वपतिः पतिमुपपन्ना "a virgin wife" i. e. a wife who is taken in marriage while she was a maid (not a widow). In both these cases the word refers to the woman.

The word कौमार is formed by adding अण् to कुमारी ॥ Thus कुमार्याम् भवः = कौमारः; तस्य स्त्री कौमारी भार्या ॥
