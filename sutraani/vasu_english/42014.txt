The affix अञ् already ordained -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]], comes in the sense of 'placed thereon' after words denoting vessels when such words are in the Locative -7th case in construction.
The word तत्र means, 'thereon' i. e. a word in the seventh case in construction. अमत्र means 'vessels': उद्धृतम् means 'placed', or literally the 'refuse of dinner'. Thus शरावेषूद्धृतः = शाराव ओदनः "boiled rice placed on a dish." So also माल्लिकः, कार्परः ॥

Why do we say "after a word denoting vessel" ? Observe पाणावुद्धृत ओदनः 'boiled rice placed on the hand'.

The word तत्र, denoting 'a word in the locative case in construction', governs the six subsequent <i>sutras</i> upto [[4.2.20]] inclusive.
