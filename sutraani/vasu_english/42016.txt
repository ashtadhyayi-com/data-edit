The affix अण् comes after a word ending in the Locative -7th case to denote 'what is prepared therein' -if that which is so prepared be 'granular food'.
Thus भ्राष्ट्रे संस्कृता भक्षा = भ्राष्टाः 'a cake fried in the pan'. Similarly कालशाः कौम्भाः ॥ Why do we say "if it means food"? Observe पुष्पपुटे संस्कृतो मालागुणः ॥
