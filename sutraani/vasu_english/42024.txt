The affix अण् -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]], is added to the name of a deity when something is to be spoken of as his.
सा = 'after a word in the Ist case in construction' अस्य 'in the sense of a sixth case'. देवता 'if the word in the first case is the name of a deity'. Thus इन्द्रो देवताऽस्य = ऐन्द्रम् 'oblation sacred to <i>Indra</i>'. Similarly आदित्यम् 'oblation belonging to <i>Aditya</i>'. So also बार्हस्पत्यम्, प्राजापत्यम् ॥ Why do we say "after the name of a deity"? Observe, कन्यादेवताऽस्य, no affix is added to कन्या ॥ In the sentences ऐन्द्रोमन्त्राः and आग्नेयो वै ब्रह्मणोदेवतयेति the affix is added by analogy.

The whole phrase साऽस्य देवता governs up to <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.35]]. Though the word स was understood in this <i>sutra</i> by <i>anuvritti</i> from <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.21]], its repetition is for the sake of indicating that the <i>anuvritti</i> of संज्ञा does not extend to it. The affix ordained by this <i>sutra</i> has the force of indicating 'lord of oblations like <i>Purodasa</i> &c offered in a sacrifice'.
