The words 1. पितृव्य 'a father's brother' 2. मातुल 'a mother's brother' 3. मातामह 'a mother's father' 4. पितामह 'a father's father' are irregularly formed.
We can infer from these forms, what were the affixes, having what indicatory letters, employed in what sense and coming after what cases of the base. Thus if any rules need be formed, we may ennunciate the following rules:- पितृमातृभ्यां भ्रातरि व्यड् डुलचौ 'the affixes व्यत् and डुलच् come respectively after the words <i>pitri</i> and <i>matri</i> in the sense of his brother'. Similarly the second rule will be ताभ्यां पितरि डामहच्, मातरिषच्च 'and the affix <i>damahach</i> comes, in the sense of their father; and their feminine is formed as if the affix had an indicatory ष् ॥ Thus पितृव्यः, मातुलः, पितामहः (f. पितामही), मातामह (f. मातामही) ॥

Vart:- The affixes सोढ, दूस, and मरीसच् come after the word अवि, in the sense of 'milk'. As अवेर्दुग्धम् = अविसोढम् or अविदूसम् or अविमरीसम् ॥

Vart:- The affixes पिञ्ज and पेज come after the word तिल, in the sense of fruitless. As निष्फलस्तिलः = तिलपिपिञ्जः and तिलपेजः ॥

Vart:- The affix पिञ्ज् is treated like डित् in the <i>Chhandas</i>. As तिल्पिञ्जः ॥
