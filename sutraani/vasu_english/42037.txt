An affix is added to a word when the sense is 'a collection thereof'.
The affix अण् [[4.7.83]] already taught, is added to a word in the 6th case in construction, in the sense of collection. What is the example of this? In order to apply the affix अण्, we must apply it to those words only, to which the special rules hereinafter taught do not apply. In other words, the affix अण् is added in the sense of collection thereof, to a word which denotes a conscious being, which has <i>udatta</i> accent on the first syllable, which does not end with a <i>Gotra</i>-affix, and which is not a word specifically mentioned in the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. For, a word expressing a non-conscious being, will take the affix ठक् by [[4.2.47]], a word having <i>anudatta</i> on the first syllable will have the affix अञ् [[4.3.44]], a <i>Gotra</i> word will take वुञ् [[4.2.39]] and especial words like केदार &c take यञ् &c. Making all these exclusions, the example we is:- काकानां समूहः = काकम् 'a collection of crows' बाकम् ॥ The phrase तस्य समूहः of this aphorism governs all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> up to <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.51]] inclusive.

Vart:- The affix ग्रामच् comes after the words गुण् &c. As गुणग्रामः 'a collection of qualities', करणग्रामः &c. The following is some of such words:- गुण, करण, तत्व, शब्द, इन्द्रिय, &c. It is an <i>akritigana</i>.
