The affix अण् is added to the names of Meters, indicates a प्रगाथ beginning therewith.
The words of this <i>sutra</i> require a little explanation. सः 'that' i.e. a word in construction in the first case. अस्य 'its' i.e. this gives the meaning of the affix. आदिः 'beginning'; this qualifies the base or <i>prakriti</i>. The word इति is added for the sake of precision. छन्दसः 'after the name of a metre'. This points out the base. प्रगाथेषु 'in the sense of <i>Pragatha</i>'. This qualifies the meaning of the affix. To put it in other words, the <i>sutra</i> means, that the affix अण् is added to the name of a metre, when that metre is the beginning of a <i>Pragatha</i>, and the whole word so formed means a <i>Pragatha</i> beginning with that metre. Thus पंक्ति is the name of a metre, adding अण् to it we get पांक्तः which means "a <i>Pragatha</i> beginning with the metre <i>Pankti</i>". Similarly आनुष्टुभः, जागतः &c.

Why do we say "beginning"? If the metre is in the middle or end of a '<i>Pragatha</i>' the affix will not be employed. Why do we say 'after the name of a metre'? The affix will not be added to a word which is in the beginning of a <i>Pragatha</i>. Why do we say 'in the sense of a <i>Pragatha</i>'? The affix will not be added, if the metre is the beginning of an <i>Anuvaka</i> &c and not of a <i>Pragatha</i>. <i>Pragatha</i> is the name of a particular kind of <i>Mantra</i> or Hymn यत्र द्वे ऋचौ प्रगथनेन तिस्रः क्रियन्ते, स प्रगायनात् पकर्षगानात् वा प्रगाथ इत्युच्यते ॥

Varti:- The affix अण् is added to the name of a metre in a self-descriptive sense without changing the meaning of it; and the word so formed is in the neuter gender. As, त्रैष्टुभम् 'the metre <i>Trishtubha</i>', जागतम् &c.
