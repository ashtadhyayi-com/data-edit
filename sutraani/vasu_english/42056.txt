The affix अण् -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] when it is added to a word which denotes either the object of a battle or the warrior of a battle fought for that object or by that warrior as a leader.
The phrase सोऽस्य is understood here; showing that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added must be in the first case: and must be the name of the "object" प्रयोजनः, or of the "warrior" योद्धृ ॥ The whole word so formed must denote a 'battle'. Therefore, the word संग्राम gives the meaning of the affix.

This भद्रा प्रयोजनमस्य संग्रामस्य = भाद्रः "A battle fought for <i>Bhadra</i>". So also सौभाद्रः "a battle fought to gain <i>Subhadra</i>". Similarly अहिमाला योद्धारोऽस्य संग्रामस्य = आहिमालः 'battle led by <i>Ahimala</i> warriors' So also स्यान्दनाश्वः, भारतः ॥

Why do we say "in the sense of a battle?" Observe सुभद्रा प्रयोजनमस्य दानस्य '<i>Subhadra</i> is the object of this gift'. Here no affix is added. Why do we say 'after a word denoting an object or a warrior'? Observe, सुभद्रा प्रेक्षिकाऽस्य संग्रामस्य ।
