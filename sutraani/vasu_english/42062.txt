The affix इनि comes in the sense of 'who studies or who knows' after the word अनुब्राह्मण।
This debars अण् ॥ The word अनुब्राह्मण means 'a book in the imitation of or similar to a <i>Brahmana</i> book'. He who studies an अनुब्राह्मण is called अनुब्राह्मणिन्, which word is thus declined:- अनुब्राह्मणी, अनुब्राह्मणिनौ, अनुब्राह्मणिनः &c. The affix इनि also has the force of मतुप्, and by <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.115]] अत इनि ठनौ, this word अनुब्राह्मण might have taken both the affixes इनि and ठन् in the sense of मतुप्; but as a matter of fact, it only takes इनि in that sense.
