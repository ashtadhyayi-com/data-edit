The affix denoting denoting 'who studies or who knows that' is elided by लुक् after the title of a sūtra work having क् as penultimate.
Thus अष्टकं is the title of <i>Panini</i> <i>sutra</i>. Those who study अष्टकं and will be called also अष्टकः, as अष्टकाः पाणिनीयाः 'those who study, the <i>Ashtaka</i>'. So also दशका वैयाघ्रपदीयाः, त्रिकाः काशकृत्स्नाः ॥

Vart:- The elision takes place only where the title is formed by a numeral: as in the examples above given. Thus महावार्तिकं सूत्रमधीते = महावार्तिकः, so also कालापकः ॥

Why do we say "having क् for its penultimate"? Observe चतुष्टयमधीते = चातुष्टयः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> applies, of course, to those words which are not formed by affixes denoting प्रोक्त or the Announcer.
