The affixes denoting the Announcer when added to छन्दस् (Vedas) and the ब्राह्मण-sūtras express this relation only.
The word प्रोक्त is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. The force of the affixes denoting announcer [[4.3.101]], when used after a word denoting a Vedic Text or a <i>Brahmana</i>, is that of expressing "one who studies" or "one who knows". तद्विषयाणि means "this relation", i.e. the subject treated of in this section, namely, the relation of अध्येतृ or वेदितृ ॥ In other words, the affixes, which ordinarily denote 'announcer', have the force of "one who studies or one who knows" when added to <i>Veda</i>-Text or <i>Brahmanas</i>. That is, a प्रोक्त affix should not be added to a <i>Veda</i> or a <i>Brahmana</i>, except when an अध्येतृ or वेदितृ affix follows it, and as such latter affixes are always elided by [[4.2.94]], it follows that a प्रोक्त affix when added to a <i>Veda</i> or a <i>Brahmana</i>, means "he who studies or knows the <i>Veda</i> anounced by". In fact there is no affix which can denote merely the announcer of a <i>Veda</i>, perhaps because the Vedas are eternal and no one can be its announcer only, but must be one who has studied it and known it, in order to qualify him to promulgate it.

Thus from the word कठ, the name of a <i>Veda</i>-Text, we get कठाः meaning 'those who study or know <i>Katha</i> Veda'. The word is thus formed. To the word कठ we add the affix णिनि denoting announcer, by [[4.3.104]] : then we elide it by [[4.3.107]], leaving the bare word कट, then we add अण्, which again we elide by [[4.2.64]]. कठ + णिनि = कट + o [[4.3.107]]; कठ + अण् = कठ [[4.2.64]] Plural कठाः "those who study the <i>Veda</i> announced by <i>Katha</i>".

Other examples to illustrate this <i>sutra</i> are: मौदाः [[4.3.101]] 'who study the <i>Veda</i> announced by <i>Muda</i>'. पैप्पलादः, आर्चाभिनः [[4.3.104]] वाजसनेयिनः [[4.3.106]] "who study the <i>Veda</i> announced by <i>Pippalada</i>, <i>Richava</i>, or <i>Vajasaneya</i>". Similarly with words denoting a <i>Brahmana</i>-Text. Thus : ताण्डिनः [[4.3.104]], भाल्लविनः [[4.3.105]], शाट्यायनिनः [[4.3.105]] ऐतरेयिणः [[4.3.105]] "who study the <i>Brahmanas</i> announced by <i>Tandya</i>, <i>Bhallava</i>, <i>Satyayana</i>, or <i>Aitareya</i>". 

Why is the word <i>Brahmana</i> which is also <i>Chhandas</i>, used separately in this <i>sutra</i>? In order to include only a certain limited number of <i>Brahmana</i> Texts to the benefits of this rule, and not all. Thus it will not apply to the <i>Brahmana</i> announced by <i>Yajnyavalkya</i>. Thus याज्ञवल्क्येन प्रोक्तानि ब्राह्मणानि = याज्ञवल्क्यानि ॥ Similarly सौलभानि ॥ These <i>Brahmanas</i> being of recent origin, the presumption of eternity does not apply to them, See [[4.3.105]].

The word च meaning "and" is employed in the <i>sutra</i>. It has the force of applying this rule to some other cases not specially mentioned in the <i>sutra</i>. Thus it will apply to some <i>Kalpa</i> Texts and <i>Sutra</i> Texts also. Thus काश्यपिनः, कौशिकिनः "who study or know the <i>Kalpa</i> texts announced by <i>Kasyapa</i> or <i>Kusika</i>" so also <i>sutra</i> : as, "the पाराशरिणो भिक्षवः "the <i>Bhikshus</i> who study the <i>Sutras</i> promulgated by <i>Parasara</i>". शैलालिनो नटाः, कर्मन्दिनः, कृशश्विनः &c.

Why do we say "<i>Chhandas</i> and <i>Brahmanas</i>"? Because the प्रोक्त affix after any other word will have its own significance, pure and simple; as, पाणिनीयं व्याकरणम् ॥ पैङ्गीकल्पः ॥
