After a word in the Genitive -6th-Case in construction an affix is added in the sense of 'his dwelling-place' the whole word expressing the name of a country.
The <i>sutra</i> literally means "his dwelling place". A place is sometimes named after the people whose habitation it is. Thus शैवः "the country of the <i>Sibis</i>", ॠजुनावान्निवासौ देशः = आर्जुनावः ॥ The word ॠजुनावां = ॠज्वीनौर्येषां ॥
