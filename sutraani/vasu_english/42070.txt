And lastly a place is named after whatever is found near it.
In this aphorism the word, to which the affix is to be added, is not shown. The word तस्य must, therefore, be supplied from the last <i>sutra</i>. It means, therefore, "an affix is added to a word in the genetive case in construction, in the sense of not far off" the whole word being the name of a place. Thus विदिशाया अदूर भवं = वैदिशम् is the city in the neighbourhood of which the river <i>Vidisa</i> flows. So also हैमवतम् ॥

The च has the force of combining the sense of all the three previous aphorisms with this; so that the four <i>sutras</i> 67.68, 69 and 70 form but one complete <i>sutra</i>, and the meaning denoted by these will be understood in the subsequent aphorisms.
