The affix अञ् comes after a stem ending in a उ or ऊ (in the four-fold senses given above).
This of course debars the universal affix अण् [[4.1.83]]. Thus आरडवम् from अरडु 'a tribe of <i>Kshatriyas</i>'; काक्षतवम् from कक्षतु, and कार्कटेलवम् from कर्कटेलू ॥ But from इक्षु we have इक्षुमती 'the river <i>lkshumati</i>, named after the sugarcanes near it'. Here we add the affix मतुप् taught in the subsequent <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.85]], which debars अञ् by the rule of a subsequent debarring the prior when both are of equal force (1.4. 2). The affix अञ् governs the six <i>sutras</i> upto [[4.2.77]]. The difference betweenअञ् and अण् consists in the accent.
