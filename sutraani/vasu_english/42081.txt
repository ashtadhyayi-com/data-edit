The name of a kingdom is formed by the लुप् elision of these affixes (when the name of the people without the change of number and gender, is at the same time the name of the kingdom).
The words within bracket in the above <i>sutra</i> are added by the reading together of this <i>sutra</i> with <i>sutra</i> [[1.2.51]]. Dr. Otto Bohtlingk the learned translator of <i>Panini</i> in German, has done so, and I think this addition is necessary for the elucidation of the <i>sutra</i>. The aphorism literally means : (The quadruply significant affix) is elided, when the place (देश) to be named is a kingdom (जनपद). Thus पंचालानां निवासो जनपदः = पंचालाः । So also कुरवः, मत्स्याः, अङ्गाः, वङ्गाः, मगधाः, सुह्माः, पुण्ड्राः ॥

Why is there no <i>lup</i>-elision of the affix in the following examples : औदुम्बरो जनपदः 'the Kingdom in which there are fig-trees'. वैदिशो जनपदः &c? Because here the words औदुम्बरः and वैदिशः are not names of Kingdom, but are used merely as epithets. In fact the phrase तन्नाम्नि is understood here also.
