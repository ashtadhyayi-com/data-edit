Optionally after the word शर्करा the 4-fold significant affix is elided by लुप् ।
Why do we say "Optionally"? The word शर्करा occurs in the classes कुमुदादि (2) and वराहादि (14) ([[4.2.80]] classes 4 and 16), and must necessarily take the affixes ठच् and कक् taught therein: for had it not taken those affixes absolutely, their would have been no necessity of inserting this word in those classes. The present rule, therefore teaches by implication, that the word शर्करा takes the general affix अण्, besides the above two especial affixes, denoting locality And when the word takes this universal affix [[4.1.83]], there the option is, allowed, not otherwise. Thus शर्करा + अण् = शार्कर꣡म्, शर्करा + अण् लुप् = शर्करा ॥
