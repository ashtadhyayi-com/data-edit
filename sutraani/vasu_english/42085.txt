The affix मतुप् is added denoting a river.
When the name of a river is to be designated by something which is found near it, we add the affix मतुप् (मत् and वत्). Thus उदुम्बरा꣡वती, मशका꣡वती, वीरणा꣡वती, पुष्करा꣡वती, इक्षु꣡मती, द्रु꣡मती ॥ See [[6.3.119]] by which the अ is lengthened in these words, and [[6.1.219]] by which the <i>udatta</i> is placed on this vowel. See [[8.2.10]] by which मत् becomes वत् ॥

The affix मतुप् is not however employed in forming the river-names भागीरथी and भैमरथी, which are formed by अण् added under [[4.2.68]].
