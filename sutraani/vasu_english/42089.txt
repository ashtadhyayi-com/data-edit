The affix वलच् comes after the word शिखा in the above four senses.
Thus शिखावलम् 'the city <i>Sikha</i>-<i>vala</i>' lit. 'crested as a peacock'. The word शिखा takes वलच् by [[5.2.111]], the affix having the same force as मतुप् [[5.2.94]], ('whose it is' or 'in whom it is'). That वलच् should be distinguished from the present, in as much as, the latter is employed in making names of locality, not so the affix taught in Book V.
