The affixes taught hereafter have senses other than those mentioned above.
The suffixes that will be taught now have senses other than those already taught in the previous aphorisms. "Let a meaning, other than those of which 'progeny' [[4.1.92]] was the first mentioned, and the quadruple signification, the last, be called 'शेष or the remainder'-- and in that remainder of senses, too, let there be the affix अण् &c. Thus चाक्षुषं 'visible' viz. colour which is apprehended by 'vision' from चक्षुष्; श्रावणः 'audible' viz. sound, from श्रवण, औपनिषदः 'treated of in <i>Upanishad</i>' i. e. soul, दार्षदः from दृषदः, 'ground on a stone' i. e. flour of a fried corn, चातुरं 'ridden in by four person' viz. a cart; चातुर्दशम् 'who is seen on the fourteenth day of the moon' viz a goblin; औलूखलः 'pounded in a mortar' viz. barley: आश्वः 'drawn by horses' viz. a chariot." (Adapted from Dr. Ballantyne's <i>Laghukaumudi</i>).

The regulating influence of the expression शेषे "in the remainder" extends from this aphorism forward as far as [[4.3.134]]. The affixes छ &c taught hereafter, do not come in the sense of 'progeny' &c, but they have, every one of them, all the senses of जात 'being born' [[4.3.25]], प्रोक्तः [[4.3.101]], आगतः [[4.3.74]] &c. निवासः [[4.3.89]], &c कृतः &c [[4.3.38]].

Thus स्रौघ्नः means "born in <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.25]], or done in <i>Srughna</i>, or bought in <i>Srughna</i>, or obtained in <i>Srughna</i>, or skillful in <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.38]], or abundant in <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.39]], or suited to <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.41]], or staying in <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.53]], or what has come from <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.74]] or which has its rise in <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.83]], a road leading to <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.85]] a messenger going to <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.85]], a gate facing <i>Srughna</i> or from which men go out to <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.86]] a book relating to the History of <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.87]], an inhabitant of <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.89]], a person whose ancestral home is at <i>Srughna</i> [[4.3.90]]"
