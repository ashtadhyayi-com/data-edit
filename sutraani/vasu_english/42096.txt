The affix ढकञ् is added to the words 1. कुल 2. कुक्षि and 3. ग्रीवा when the whole words so formed mean respectively 'a dog', 'a sword' and 'an ornament'.
The force of the affix, as already told above, is to denote 'produce' &c. [[4.3.25]] &c)): but the whole word has specific significance. As कौलेयकः = a dog (lit. pertaining to a family); कौक्षेयकः = a sword (lit. remaining in a sheath), ग्रैवेयकः = a necklace. When not having these meanings; the regular derivatives from these words are formed by अण् as, कौलः, कौक्षः and ग्रैवः ॥
