The affix अञ् comes in the remaining senses after a word consisting of more than two syllables having उदात्त accent on the final, being the name of a village of the people of the North.
The governing force of the word दिक् ceases here. The अञ् debars अण् ॥ Thus शैव꣡पुरम्, भा꣡ण्डपुरम् ॥

Why do we say "village of north-folk"? Observe माथुर꣡म् formed by अण्; difference in accent.

Why do we say "consisting of more than two syllables"? Observe ध्वजी꣡—ध्वज꣡म् ॥

Why do we say "being oxytone?" Observe शार्करीधा॑नम् ॥ Here धा is <i>udatta</i> by [[6.1.194]], taking लित् accent.
