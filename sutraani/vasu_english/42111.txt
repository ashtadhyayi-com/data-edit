The affix अण् comes after the Patronymics formed from कण्व etc.
Here the word गोत्रे does not qualify the sense of the base, nor does it give the sense of the affix. It simply means "that after a word ending with the affix which has been ordained after the words <i>Kanva</i> &c, in denoting a <i>Gotra</i> or Family-name; the affix अण् is employed in the remaining senses." This debars the affix छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus काण्वाः "the pupils of <i>Kanva</i>". गौकक्षाः [[4.1.105]].

Why do we say "when denoting Family-names?" Thus the word काण्व, when it means कण्व देवताऽस्य, forms its secondary derivative काण्वीयम् by छ ॥

The <i>Kanva</i>-class is a sub-class of <i>Gargadi</i>. The Family-names from कण्व and गौकक्ष are का꣡ण्व्य and गौ꣡काक्ष्य by rule [[4.1.105]]. To this, the affix अण् is added. काण्व्य + अण् = काण्वः꣡ [[6.4.148]] and [[6.4.152]].
