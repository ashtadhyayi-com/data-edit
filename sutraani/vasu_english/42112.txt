After a family-name formed by इञ् the affix अण् is added in the remaining senses.
This debars अण् ॥ Thus from दक्ष we have Patronymic दाक्षि, from which दाक्षाः "the pupils of <i>Dakshi</i>" ; प्लाक्षाः, माहकाः ॥ The final इ is elided before अण् by [[6.4.148]].

Why do we say 'denoting a family-name'? Observe सौतङ्गमिः, a word formed by इञ् of [[4.2.80]], not denoting a family, but having the four-fold sense of [[4.2.68]] - [[4.2.70]]. The further derivative from this will be सौतङ्गमीयम् by छ [[4.2.114]].
