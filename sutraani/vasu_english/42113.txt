The affix अण् is however not added to a word which though ending in the Patronymic affix इञ् consists of two syllables when it is the family name of Eastern People or of भरत।
This <i>sutra</i> debars अण् which would have come by the last <i>sutra</i>. The result being, that the words answering to the description given in this aphorism, form the शैषिक derivatives by the affix छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus पौष्कीयाः, काशीयाः from पौष्कि, काशि ॥ Why do we say "consisting of two syllables"? Observe पान्नागाराः formed by अण् from पान्नागारि ॥

Why do we say "when it denotes the family-names of East folks or <i>Bharata</i>"? Observe: दाक्षाः from दाक्षि ॥

Q. How do you form काशीय when by rule [[4.2.116]], the proper form would be काशिकी or काशिका ?

Ans. The word काशि of <i>sutra</i> 116 refers to a country because it occurs with चेदि, while the काशि of the example under the present aphorism is a Family-name.
 
The <i>Bharatas</i> belong also to the East-Folk or <i>Prachyas</i>. Their separate mention here indicates by <i>Jhapaka</i> or inference, that whereever <i>Prachya</i> is used in these <i>sutras</i>, it does not include the <i>Bharatas</i>. See [[1.4.6]].
