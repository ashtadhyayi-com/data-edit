The affix वुञ् comes in the remaining senses after a वृद्ध word denoting a locality which has the letter य as its penultimate and after a वृद्ध place name denoting a waste or desert place.
The words वृद्धात् and देशे are understood here. The word धन्व means a waste or desert. Thus पारेधन्वकः, ऐरावतकः are examples of धन्व ॥ Similarly सांकाश्यकः and काम्पिल्यकः are examples of य penultimate.
