The affix वुञ् comes in the remaining senses after a वृद्ध word denoting a locality and ending with 1. प्रस्थ 2. पुर or वह।
This debars छ [[4.2.114]]. Thus मालाप्रस्थकः, नान्दीपुरकः, कान्तिपुरकः, पैलुवहकः, फाल्गुनीवहकः ॥

The words ending in पुर would have taken the affix वुञ् by the next <i>sutra</i> also, but as that <i>sutra</i> is restricted to the countries of the East, this <i>sutra</i> is general in its scope.
