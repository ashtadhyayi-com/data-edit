The affix अण् comes in the remaining senses after the words कच्छ etc. denoting places.
The word देशे is understood here. This debars वुञ् &c. Thus काच्छः, सैन्धवः, वार्णवः &c. The words कच्छ &c. are not invariable plural words, because by the next <i>sutra</i>, it is shown that these words may signify men and their habits &c. The word विजापक occurs in this list. It would have taken अण् by the last <i>sutra</i> also, because it has क as its penultimate. Its mention in the list is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i> by which it takes वुञ् also under certain conditions.
