The affix वुञ् comes after the word साल्व in the senses of being born etc. when denoting 'a man 'or 'what exists in a man', provided that it does not mean a foot-soldier.
The word साल्व which occurs in the कच्छादि class, would have taken वुञ् by the last <i>sutra</i>, when the sense was that of a man or some human attribute. The present <i>sutra</i> makes a restriction. Thus साल्वको मनुष्यः, साल्वकमस्य हसितं जल्पितं &c. But साल्वः पदाति र्व्रजति 'the <i>Salva</i> foot soldier goes.'
