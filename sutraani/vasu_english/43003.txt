In expressing one individual, तबक and ममक are the substitutes of युष्मद् and अस्मद् respectively when खञ् and अण् follow.
As तावकीनः 'belonging to thee', मामकीनः "belonging to me." तावकः and मामकः ॥ But when the affix is छ, the form wil त्वदीयः, मदीयः.
 
The word एकवचने should not be construed as meaning the affix of the singular number, as the affix सु ॥ Because the affix of the singular is always elided (लुक्) after these words, and by rule [[1.1.63]], there will not be the application of this rule. This difficulty is, however, got over by explaining the word एकवचने as equal to एकार्थे ॥
