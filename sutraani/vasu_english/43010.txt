The affix यञ् comes in the remaining senses after the word द्वीप , which is near the sea.
The word द्वीप occurs in the list of <i>Kachchhadi</i> [[4.2.133]], and would have taken अण्; and by <i>sutra</i> [[4.2.134]], it would have taken वुञ् also. The present <i>sutra</i> debars both those affixes, when the word द्वीप means अनुसमुद्र or 'near the sea'.

Thus द्वैप्यम् 'living on or relating to an island'. As द्वैप्यं भवन्तोऽनुचरन्ति चक्रम् ॥

Why do we say अनुसमुद्रं ? Observe द्वैपकम् or द्वैपम् [[4.2.133]] and [[4.2.134]]. The word '<i>anu</i>-<i>samudra</i>' is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound [[2.1.15]].
