The affix अण् comes always after the word हेमन्त and (before this affix) the letter त of हेमन्त is elided.
Thus हैमनम् वासः 'wintery residence.' हैमनमुपलेपनम् ॥

The word सर्वत्र is used to show that the <i>sutra</i> applies in the <i>Chhandas</i> as well as in the secular literature.

The word हेमन्त will take अण् by <i>sutra</i> [[4.3.16]] as हैमन्ती पङ्क्तिः but there is no elision of त there. Thus there are three forms हैमन्तः [[4.3.16]], हैमन्तिकं [[4.3.21]] and हैमनम् ॥
