Optionally after the words 1. पूर्वाह्ण and 2. अपराह्ण there are the affixes ट्यु and ट्युल् and their augment is तुट्।
In the alternative ठञ् of [[4.3.11]] also occurs. As पूर्वाह्णेत꣡नम्, अपराह्णे꣡तनम् with <i>tyu</i>, or पौ꣡र्वाह्णिकम् आ꣡पराह्णिकम् with <i>than</i>. With <i>tyul</i>, we have पूर्वाह्णेत꣡नं and अपराह्णेत꣡नं ॥  The sign of the locative is not elided by rule [[6.3.17]]. When the word is taken as incapable of having the case-affix, we have, पूवाह्णत꣡नं or पूर्वाह्ण꣡तनः ॥
