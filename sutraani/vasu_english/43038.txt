An affix (one of those already taught) comes after a word in the Locative -7th case, in the sense of 'done there', 'obtained there', 'bought there' and 'dexterous therein'.
Thus स्रौघ्नः may mean "done in, or bought in, or obtained in, or skillful in <i>Srughna</i>". So also the words माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥
