After a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) or a word ending in the feminine affix ङि and आप् , being in the Locative -7th case in construction, an affix comes in the sense of 'adapted therein'. 
Except the word 'adapted' which is the meaning of the word संभूत, all the other words of the <i>sutra</i> have been supplied from the previous aphorisms. The word संभूत does not mean in this <i>sutra</i> 'origin' or 'existence', for the word जात and भव already express that notion. It here means 'suitableness' 'adequacy' i.e. अवक्लृप्तिः and प्रमाणातिरेकः ॥

Thus स्रुघ्ने संभवति = सौघ्नः 'what is suited to the country of <i>Srughna</i>.' So also माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥ The word तत्र is understood here also.
