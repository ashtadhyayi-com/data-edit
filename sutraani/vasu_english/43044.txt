An affix comes after a word denoting 'time' being in the Locative -7th case in construction meaning 'sown therein'.
Thus हेमन्ते उप्यन्ते = हैमन्ता यवाः 'the barley sown in autumn.' ग्रैष्मा व्रीहयः ॥

The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i> in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of उप्त only goes, which could not have been the case had this word been included in the last <i>sutra</i>.
