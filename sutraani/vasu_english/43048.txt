The affix वुञ् comes in the sense of 'debt then due' after the words 1. कलापिन् 2. अश्वत्थ and 3. यवबुस् , denoting time and being in the Locative -7th case.
The words कलापी &c are words which indirectly denote time. Thus the time in which the peacocks mate and make noise is called कलापी ॥ The time in which the <i>asvatha</i> tree fructifies is called अश्वत्थः ॥ The time in which barley is thrashed out is called यवबुस 'barley-chaff'? Thus कलापिनिकाले देयमृणं = कलापकम् 'a debt to be paid when the peacocks make noise (i. e. mating or rainy season) tails.' अश्वत्थकम् and यवबुसकम् ॥
