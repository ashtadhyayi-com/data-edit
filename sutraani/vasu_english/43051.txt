An affix comes after a word in the Locative -7th case in construction denoting time, in the sense of 'who then wanders' and the word so formed refers to a wild beast.
Thus निशायां व्याहरति मृगः "an animal that wanders at night." So also प्रादोषः or प्रादोषिकः [[4.3.14]] 'a brute that yells in the morning.'

Why do we say मृगः 'a beast' ? Observe निशायां व्याहरति उलूकः ॥ Here there is no affixing. The word व्याहरति also means 'to make noise.' The <i>Sutra</i> may, therefore, also be translated as : "After a word denoting time, an affix [[4.1.83]] comes in expressing a wild beast who makes noise at that time".
