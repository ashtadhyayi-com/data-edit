An affix comes after a word in the Locative -7th case in construction in the sense of 'who stays there'.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of कालात् ceases. The sense of भव here is 'existence', and not that of 'birth' : because the sense of 'birth' is taught in <i>sutra</i> तत्र जातः [[4.3.25]]. Thus, स्रुघ्ने भवः = स्रौघ्नः "who stays in <i>Srughna</i>". माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥

The repetition of तत्र in the <i>sutra</i> though its <i>annuvritti</i> could have been drawn from the previous <i>sutras</i>, is for the sake of stopping the <i>annuvritti</i> of तदस्य ॥
