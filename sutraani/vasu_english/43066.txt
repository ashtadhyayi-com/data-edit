After the name of a subject of commentary an affix comes in the sense of 'its commentary', as well as in the sense of 'what occurs there'.
That by which a thing is explained is called व्याख्यान or 'commentary'. The name of a thing explainable is called व्याख्यातव्यनाम ॥ After such a name, being in the 6th case in construction, the affix is added. The affix means तस्यव्याख्यानं as well as तत्रभव, the latter being read into the <i>sutra</i> by virtue of च ॥

Thus सुपां व्याख्यानः = सौपो ग्रन्थः '<i>Saupa</i>, a book on the explanation of case-affixes'. So also '<i>Tainga</i>-- a Commentary on Verbal affixes' कार्तः '<i>Karta</i>-- a Commentary on <i>krit</i> affixes'. सौप &c. may also mean सुप्सु भवं &c.

Why do we say व्याख्यातव्यनाम्नः 'after the name of the thing explainable'? The thing to be explained must be a Book, therefore, the affix will not apply to the name of a city &c. For example, if a model be made to describe the city of <i>Pataliputra</i>, such a model will not be named after <i>Pataliputra</i> by the addition of affix. Thus सुकोशला is a modal giving a description of <i>Pataliputra</i>. This will not be called <i>Pataliputram</i>.

The <i>anuvritti</i> of भव and व्याख्यान runs simultaneosly in all the subsequent <i>apavada</i> <i>sutras</i>, and hence we have read the <i>anuvritti</i> of भव into this <i>sutra</i> also.
