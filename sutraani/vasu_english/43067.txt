The affix ठञ् comes in the sense of 'staying' and 'a commentary' after a polysyllabic word having उदात्त on the final (the word being the name of a thing to be explained).
This debars अण् ॥ Thus षात्वणत्विकम् 'a commentary of the rules of changes of स and न into ष and ण' ॥ नातानतिकम् 'a commentary on (अनत) <i>udatta</i> and <i>anudatta</i> (नत)' ॥ The radicals षत्वणत्व and नतानत are acutely accented on the final by the rule of a compound having accent on the final [[6.1.169]]

Why do we say बह्वचः 'polysyllabic'? Observe सौपम्, तैङम् &c. A word of two syllables will take ठक् [[4.3.72]]. So the counter example must be of words of one syllable.

Why do we say 'having acute accent on the final'? Observe सांहितम् from संहिता ॥ This word has acute accent on the initial by the rule of <i>Gati</i>-accent [[6.2.49]]
