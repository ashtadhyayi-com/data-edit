The affix ठञ् comes after the name of an explainable work called after a ऋषि in the senses of 'occurring therein' or 'commentary thereon' when it refers to an अध्याय only.
The word ऋषि is the name of प्रवर and those <i>Rishis</i> are only meant whose names are in the <i>Pravara</i> list. The word so formed means always an <i>Adhyaya</i> or Chapter of the work. The phrase व्याख्यातव्यनाम्नः is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, hence the word ऋषि means "a work the author of which is a <i>Rishi</i>".

Thus वसिष्ठस्य व्याख्यानस्तत्र भवो वा = वासिष्ठिकोऽध्यायः "<i>Vasishthika</i>- a chapter containing commentary on <i>Vashishtha</i>". वैश्वामित्रिकः 'a chapter of commentary on <i>Visvamitra</i>'.

Why do we say meaning 'chapter'? Observe वासिष्ठिकी ऋक् ॥
