The affix वुञ् comes in the sense of 'thence come' after a word denoting a person connected through the relationship or family origin.
Persons related (<i>sambandha</i>) through learning (such as teacher and pupil), or through blood (<i>yoni</i>, e. g. father and son) are called विद्यायोनिसम्बन्धाः ॥ Words denoting such persons take the affix वुञ्. This debars अण् and छ. Thus उपाध्यायादागतम् = औपाध्यायकम् 'knowledge derived from a spiritual teacher.' शैष्यकम्, आचार्यकम् ॥ So also योनिसंबन्धः as मातामहकः 'wealth derived from a maternal grand-father.' पितामहकः, मातुलकः ॥
