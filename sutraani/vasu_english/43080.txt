After a word ending with a Patronymic affix the rule of affix in the sense of 'thence come' is like that relating to the affix denoting its mark.
The word गोत्र in the <i>sutra</i> does not mean the technical <i>Gotra</i> of Grammar, but a descendant-denoting affix in general. The affixes denoting अङ्क are taught in [[4.3.126]] and [[4.3.127]]. The affix वुञ् of [[4.3.126]] which comes after <i>Gotra</i> words, in the sense of 'this is his,' is refered to in this <i>sutra</i>, not merely the affix अण् of [[4.3.127]], denoting, 'this is his mark'.

Thus औपगवानामङ्कः = औपगवकः 'the mark belonging to the descendants of <i>Upagu</i>.' So also कापटवकः, नाडायनकः, चारायणकः ॥ The same words will also denote 'come there from' as औपगवेभ्य आगतम् = औपगवकम्, कापटवकम्, नाडायनकम्, चारायणकम् (formed by वुञ् [[4.3.126]]).
 
Similarly बैदः, गार्गः, दाक्षः formed by अण् of [[4.3.127]] mean not only 'the mark belonging to the <i>Vaidas</i>, the <i>Gargyas</i>, the <i>Dakshis</i>,' but also that which comes from the <i>Vaidas</i> &c. The word यत् has the force of 'complete similarity,' as in कालेभ्यो भववत् [[4.2.34]], चरणेभ्यो धर्मवत् [[4.2.46]].
