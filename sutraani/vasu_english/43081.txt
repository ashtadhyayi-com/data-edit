The affix रूप्य denotes that which from something has originated when it is added to a word denoting 'cause' or to the name of a man viewed as a cause.
The word मनुष्य is used meaning 'men as causes.' हेतु means cause or instrument. Thus समादागतं = समरूप्यम् or समीयम् by छ of [[4.2.138]] meaning 'what proceeds from a like cause.' So also विषमरूप्यम् or विषमीयम् ॥ So of men also देवदत्तरूप्यम् or दैवदत्तम् [[4.1.83]] 'what originates with देवदत्तः', यज्ञदत्तरूप्यम् or यज्ञदत्तम् ॥

The word हेतुमनुष्येभ्यः is in the plural in the <i>sutra</i>, indicating that <i>svarupavidhi</i> [[1.1.68]] does not apply here.

In denoting हेतु, there is employed the Instrumental case as taught in [[2.3.23]]: and according to the <i>jnapaka</i> in the present <i>sutra</i>, the Ablative case may also be employed in denoting a हेतु, ॥ Or the use of the ablative case in the sense of हेतु, may be explained by [[2.3.25]].
