After a word denoting a cause or a man viewed as a cause, there is the affix मयट् in the sense of 'come thence'.
Thus सममयम्, विषममयम्, देवदत्तमयम्, यज्ञदत्तमयम् ॥

The ट् of मयट् indicates that the feminine of these words are formed by ङीप् [[4.1.15]], as, सममयी ॥ The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last is for the sake of preventing the application of the rule of mutual correspondence (1.3. 10) which would have been the case had the rule stood as हेतुमनुष्येभ्योऽन्यतरस्यां रूप्यमयटौ ॥
