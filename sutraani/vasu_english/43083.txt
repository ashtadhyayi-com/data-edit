After a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) which is the Ablative -5th case in construction, an affix (one of those already taught) comes in the sense of 'what appears for the first time'.
The word ततः is understood in the <i>sutra</i>. The word प्रभवति means what manifests itself, or appears for the first time. Thus हिमवतः प्रभवति = हैमवती "The <i>Haimavati</i>", a name of the Ganges, meaning 'which manifests itself for the first time or appears in the Snowy Range, its source being unknown'. So also दारदी "The <i>Daradi</i>" i.e. the Indus appearing for the first time in <i>Dardistan</i>. The word प्रभवति has not the sense of उत्पत्ति, because that is included in तत्र जातः; it therefore means प्रकाशते, प्रथमतः उपलभ्यते, the source or origin being unknown.
