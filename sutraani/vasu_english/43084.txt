The affix य comes in the sense of 'what manifests itself there' after the word विदुर।
<i>Karika</i>

वालवायो विदूरं च प्रकृत्यन्तरमे वा ।
न वै तत्रेति चेद्ब्रूयाज्जित्वरीवदुपाचरेत् ॥

This debars अण् ॥ Thus विदूरात् प्रभवति = वैदूर्यः 'a kind of gem found at <i> Vidura</i>'. The gem as a matter of fact is not found at <i> Vidura</i>, but in a mountain called वालवाय ॥ <i>Vidura</i> is the city where the rough stone is worked upon. In other words, it may be said that the affix is really added to वालवाय, when the latter word is replaced by विदूर; such substitute being only shown in the <i>sutra</i>, the appropriate <i>sthani</i> (<i>valavaya</i>) being left to inference. Or the word <i>Vidura</i> may denote both the city as well as a mountain. If it be said that there is no mountain known as <i>Vidura</i>, then we say that the Grammarians call <i>Valavaya</i> by the name of <i>Vidura</i>, as the merchants call <i>Benares</i> by the name of <i>Jitvari</i>.
