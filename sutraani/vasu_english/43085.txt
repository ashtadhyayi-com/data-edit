An affix -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] etc. comes after a word in the Accusative -2nd case in construction in the sense of 'what goes thereto', provided that, which goes, is a road or a messenger.
Thus स्रुघ्नम्गच्छति = स्रौघ्नः "a road or a messenger that goes to <i>Srughna</i>." So also माथुरः ॥ The road may either lead to <i>Srughna</i>, or being in <i>Srughna</i>, be used for going.

Why do we say पथिदूतयोः "meaning a road or a messenger". Observe स्रुघ्नं गच्छति सार्थः 'he goes to <i>Srughna</i> for his own sake'.
