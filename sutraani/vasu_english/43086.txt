An affix -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] etc. comes after a word in the Accusative -2nd case in construction in the sense of 'a door which looks towards that'.
Thus स्रौघ्नः 'a gate which looks towards <i>Srughna</i>', -- as a gate of <i>Kanyakubja</i>. So also माथुरम्, राष्ट्रियम् ॥

Objection. The <i>sutra</i> would have stood better as अभिनिष्क्रमणं द्वारं, for by using अभिनिष्क्रामति, you make the word द्वारं as if it was a being endowed with sense.

Ans. This objection may be answered by saying that the gate is the well-known instrument (करण) to the action of अभिनिष्क्रमण; and an instrument may be used as an agent to a verb: as साध्वसिश्छिनत्ति 'the sword cuts nicely.'

Why do we say द्वारम् "when it is a gate"? Observe स्रुघ्नमभिनिष्क्रामति पुरुषः 'a person faces towards <i>Srughna</i>'.
