After a word in the Nominative 1st-Case in construction, an affix comes in the sense of 'this is his dwelling place'.
The word स shows that the word to which the affix is to be added is in the nominative case. अस्य 'his' shows that the meaning of the affix is that of a genitive case. निवासः, shows that the first word in construction must signify a dwelling place. निवास means "a country i. e. where a person lives (<i>nivasanti</i> <i>asmin</i>)".

स्रुघ्नो निवासोऽस्य = स्रौघ्नः 'a present dweller of <i>Srughna</i>', माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः &c.
