After a word in the Nominative 1st-Case in construction, an affix comes in the sense of 'this is his mother-land'.
The difference between निवासः and अभिजनः is this. Where a person lives himself for the present, that is his निवास or dwelling-place. Where his ancestors (अभिजनाः) have lived, that is his अभिजन 'native country, home or ancestral abode'. Thus स्रौघ्नः 'a person whose ancestral home is in <i>Srughna</i>'. माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥ The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last is for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>abhijana</i>' only runs.
