The affix छ comes after a word denoting 'mountain' in the sense of 'this is his mother-land', when it is a person who lives by arms.
The word आयुधजीवी means a person who earns his livelihood by arms. The phrase सोऽस्याभिजनः is to be read into the <i>sutra</i>. Thus हृदगोलः पर्वतोऽभिजन एषामायुधजीविनां = हृद्गोलीयाः 'the mercenary soldiers whose ancestral abode is the <i>Hridgola</i> mountain'. So also अन्धकवर्त्तीयाः, रोहितगिरीयाः ॥

Why do we say आयुधजीविभ्यः ? Observe आर्क्षोदा ब्राह्मणाः "the <i>Brahmanas</i> whose native place is <i>Rikshoda</i> mountains". Why do we say 'mountains'? Observe सांकाश्यका आयुधजीविनः ॥
