After a word denoting a thing not having consciousness, but not being the name of a country or time, the affix ठक् is used in the sense of 'this is his object of devotion or love'.
This debars अण्; and छ also. Thus अपूपाभक्तिरस्य = आपूपिकः꣡ 'a person who loves cakes'. शाष्कुलिकः꣡, पायसिकः꣡ ॥

Why do we say 'not having consciousness'? Observe दैवदत्तः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'not being the name of a country'? Observe स्रौघ्नः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'not denoting time'? Observe ग्रैष्मः꣡ 'who loves Summer'.
