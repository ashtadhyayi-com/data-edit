The affix वुञ् comes in the sense of 'this is his object of veneration' after the words 1. वासुदेव and अर्जुना।
This debars छ and अण् ॥ Thus वासुदेवकः, अर्जुनकः ॥

Q. The word वासुदेव being the name of a <i>Kshatriya</i> would have taken by the next <i>sutra</i>, and there is no difference here between वुन् and वुञ्, why then include the word वासुदेव in this <i>sutra</i>?

A. The word वासुदेव here is the name of God (in which all dwell वसति अस्मिन्) and not the designation of a <i>Kshatriya</i>.

By the general rule of compounds [[2.2.34]] a word of fewer vowels is placed first, and so <i>Arjuna</i> ought to have been placed first. The not doing so in this <i>sutra</i> indicates (<i>jnapaka</i>) the existence of this rule 'that a word denoting an object of reverence is placed first. '
