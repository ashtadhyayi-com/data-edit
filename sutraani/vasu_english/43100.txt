Of words denoting Princes (literally - who are Lords of जनपद) the base and affix meaning 'this is his object of veneration' are the same, in every respect, like those of a word denoting kingdom, provided that, the Prince-denoting words have, in the plural, the same form as the Kingdom-denoting words.
The words of this <i>sutra</i> require a detailed analysis. जनपदिनाम् gen. plural of जनपदिन् meaning 'Iord of an inhabited country' i. e. <i>Kshatriya</i> Princes, बहुवचने 'in the plural', जनपदेन समान शब्दानां 'the same form as the <i>jana</i>- <i>pada</i> denoting word', जनपदवत् सर्वम् 'every thing is like <i>jana</i>-<i>pada</i>'. In other words, 'after those bases denoting <i>Kshatriya</i> Princes which in the plural have the same forms as the names of the countries, the affix in the sense of veneration will be the same as will come after a <i>janapada word</i>.' Now the affixes denoting  भक्ति as regards जनपद words are given in <i>Sutras</i> [[4.2.124]] &c. and those affixes will apply here. Thus अङ्गा जनपदो भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by वुञ् of <i>Sutra</i> [[4.2.125]], meaning 'who loves the country of <i>Angas</i>' Similarly वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः पौन्द्रकः ॥

Similarly अङ्गाः क्षत्रिया भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by the same affix वुञ्, with this difference of meaning 'who loves the <i>Kshatriyas</i> called <i>Angas</i>'. So वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः &c.

Why do we say 'of <i>Kshatriya</i> Princes'; (<i>janapadinam</i>). Observe, पंचाला ब्राह्मणा भक्तिरस्य = पांचालाः ॥ Here the general affix अण् is employed.

The word सर्व is used in the <i>sutra</i> to show that not only the affixes are the same, but the bases to which the affixes are added will be the same. In the plural, the <i>Kshatriya</i> and the <i>Janapada</i> bases have the same form, but in the singular and dual, the forms of <i>Kshatriya</i>-bases are different. Thus मद्रस्यापत्यं = sing. माद्रः [[4.1.170]] dual, माद्रौ pl. मद्राः. The form मद्राः denotes both 'the Kings or <i>Kshatriyas</i> of <i>Madras</i>' as well as 'the country called <i>Madras</i>'. Thus मद्रो भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ So also in the singular and dual, मद्राः will be the base to which the affix will be added. Thus माद्रो भक्तिरस्य माद्रौ वा भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ Similarly वार्ज्य (from वृजि [[4.1.171]]), as वार्ज्यो वा भक्तिरस्य वार्ज्यौ वा भक्तिरस्य = वृजिकः ॥

Why do we say जनपदेन समान शब्दानाम् 'the word having the same sound as the <i>janapada</i> word'? Thus अनुषण्डो जनपदः, पौरवो राजा स भक्तिरस्य = पौरवीयः ॥ Here <i>Paurava</i> and <i>Anushanda</i> have not the same sound.

The word बहुवचने is used in the <i>sutra</i>, to indicate, that, though the समान शब्दता or 'the similarity of word-form', occurs in the plural number only, yet this <i>atidesa</i> rule applies to the same words in the singular and dual also. For in the plural, the form will be same, because there the <i>Tadraja</i> affix is elided; but in the singular and dual, the <i>Tadraja</i> affix is not elided, and therefore, the word denoting a principality and the word denoting a prince will not have the same form; but this rule applies there also. As वाङ्गः or वाङ्गौ भक्तिरस्य वाङ्गकः ॥
