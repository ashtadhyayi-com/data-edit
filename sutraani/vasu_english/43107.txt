The affix denoting 'enounced by him' is elided by लुक्-substitution after the words कठ and चरक।
The word कठ would have taken णिनि as it is a वैशम्पायनान्तेवासी word: and चरक would have taken the affix अण् ॥ Both are elided. Thus कठाः 'who study the <i>Chhandas</i> enounced by <i>Katha</i>'. चरकाः &c.

The word '<i>Chhandas</i>' qualifies this <i>sutra</i>. Observe काठाः चारकाः श्लोकाः ॥
