The affix णिनि comes in the sense of 'enounced by him' after the words 1. पाराशर्य and 2. शिलालिन् , the works enounced being भिक्षु-sūtra and नट-sūtra respectively.
The affix णिनि is to be read into the <i>sutra</i> and not ढिनुक् ॥ The भिक्षुसूत्र and नटसूत्र are works treating of the duties of भिक्षुक 'religious mendicants' and नट 'jugglers, dancers'.

Thus पाराशर्य + णिनि = पाराशर + णिनि [[6.4.152]] = पाराशरिन्, 'the treatise of <i>Parasarya</i> on the duties of <i>Bhikshus</i>'. Similarly शैलालिन् ॥ These words, of course, have the additional sense of 'he who studies the works so enounced by <i>Parasarya</i> and <i>Sailalin</i>'. See [[4.2.66]]. As पाराशरिणो भिक्षवः, शैलालिनो नटाः ॥  According to some, it always expresses this relation (तद्विषयता [[4.2.66]]) and never a प्रोक्त alone. These are treated metaphorically as <i>Chhandas</i>.

Why do we say 'denoting <i>Bhikshu</i> and <i>Nata</i> <i>Sutras</i>'? Observe पाराशरम्, शैलालम् ॥
