An affix -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] etc. comes after a word in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction in the sense of 'in the same direction with that'.
The word एक दिक means तुल्य दिक i.e. a common direction. Thus सुदाम्ना एकदिक = सौदामनी विद्युत् "a lightening, literally that which is in the same direction as the hill called the <i>Sudaman</i>." So हैमवती, त्त्रैककुदी, पैलुमूली ॥

The repetition of तेन, though it could have been supplied by <i>anuvritti</i> from [[4.3.101]], is for the sake of indicating that the <i>anuvritti</i> of the छन्दस् which regulated all the preceding ten <i>sutras</i>, does not extend to this aphorism, and therefore the तद्विषयता of [[4.2.66]] which was applied in those <i>sutras</i> does not apply here.
