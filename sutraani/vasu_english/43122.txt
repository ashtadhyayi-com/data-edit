When preceded by a word denoting 'a draught animal', रथ takes the affix अञ् in the sense of 'this is his'.
This debars यत् ॥ Thus आश्वरथं चक्रं 'the wheel of a horse-cart' औष्ट्ररथम् ॥ गार्दभ रथं ॥

The word पत्र means 'that by which any one goes' or a draught-animal, like camel. It is formed by the affix ष्ट्रनृ (111.2. 182).
