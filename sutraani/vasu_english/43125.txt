The affix वुञ् comes in the sense of 'this is his' after द्वन्द compound of words denoting 'mutual enmity' or 'matrimonial relationship'.
This debars अण् and छ ॥ Thus of 'enmity' बाभ्रव्यशालङ्कायनिका, काकोलूकिका ॥ Similarly of married couples as, अत्रिभरद्वाजिका, कुत्सकुशिकिका ॥

The <i>Dvandva</i> compounds of words denoting natural enemies will be singular neuter by [[2.4.9]]. Their secondary derivatives, however, are feminine.

Vart :- Prohibition must be stated of the word देवासुर &c. As देवासुरम् ॥ राक्षोऽसुरम् वैरम् ॥
