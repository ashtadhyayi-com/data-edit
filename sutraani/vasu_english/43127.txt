The affix अण् comes in the sense of 'this is his' after a गोत्र (Patronymic) word ending with the affix अञ् or यञ् or इञ् , the words so formed expressing a multitude, a mark or a sign. 
The word संघ means 'congregation'. The word लक्षण and अङ्क should be distinguished. लक्षण means a mark which is the property of that person and forms a distinguishing feature of that person, as विद्या 'learning' is a लक्षण of the clan of <i>Bidas</i>, the <i>Bidas</i> being famous for learning. The word अङ्क is a mark which shows that the thing so marked is the property of another : as a mark on a cow showing to what person or clan that cow belongs. The अङ्क though occurring in a person or thing does not belong to that person or thing, as the mark of a cow does not belong to the cow, but the लक्षण is a mark which belongs to the person or thing wherein it is found.

This <i>sutra</i> debars वुञ् of the last aphorism.

Vart :- The word घोष 'a cow-pen', should also be read along with संघ &c. Thus the words so formed denote four things (1) congregation, (2) mark (3) sign (4) a hamlet or cowpen. This being so, the rule of mutual correspondence according to order of enumeration [[1.3.10]] does not apply.

Thus अञन्तात् [[4.1.104]] -- बैदः 'a congregation, or mark or sign or a hamlet of the <i>Bidas</i>'. यञन्तात् [[4.1.105]] — गार्ग्य + अण् = गार्गः [[6.4.148]], [[6.4.151]] "a congregation, or a mark, or a sign or a hamlet belonging to the <i>Gargyas</i> ?" इञन्तात् [[4.1.95]] — दाक्षि + अण् = दाक्षः [[6.4.148]] 'a congregation &c of the <i>Dakshis</i>'.

The ण् of अण् could not serve the purpose of <i>Vriddhi</i> here, for all the words to which this affix is added, have <i>Vriddhi</i> by virtue of the affixes अञ्, यञ् or इञ् in which they end. The अ would have served the purpose as well, so far as <i>Vriddhi</i> is concerned, but अण् is used to show that the feminine is formed by ङीप् [[4.1.15]], Thus बैदी ॥ It further prevents पुंवद्भाव in compounds [[6.3.39]], as, बैदी विद्याऽस्य = बैदीविद्यः i.e. बिदानामसाधारणी या विद्या सा यस्यास्ति स ॥
