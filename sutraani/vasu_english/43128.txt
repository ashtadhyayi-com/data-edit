The affix अण् optionally comes in the sense of 'this is his congregation, mark, sign or hamlet' after the word शाकल।
This debars वुञ् ॥ Thus शाकलेन प्रोक्तमधीयते = शाकलाः [[4.3.101]] and [[4.2.64]], शाकलानाम् संघः = शाकलः or शाकलकः [[4.3.126]] meaning 'a congregation, &c of the students of the science revealed by <i>Sakala</i>'.
