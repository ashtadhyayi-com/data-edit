The affix वुञ् is not used after a Family-name when it denotes 'a beginner pupil' and 'a boarder pupil'.
The word दण्डमाणवाः means a little naughty boy (माणव), the only means of instilling knowledge in whom is the rod (खण्ड), or whose principal sign of studentship is the '<i>danda</i>' and nothing intrinsic. i.e. a mere beginner. The न is changed to ण in माणव by [[4.1.161]] <i>karika</i>. अन्तेवासिनः are pupils or boarders who live in their teacher's house. The word '<i>gotra</i>' is understood here. Thus दाक्षाः 'the junior or the senior pupils of <i>Dakshi</i>.' माहकाः ॥ So also गौकक्षा दण्डमाणवा अन्तेवासिनोवा ॥
