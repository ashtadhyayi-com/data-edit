An affix -- प्राग्दीव्यतोऽण् [[4.1.83]] etc., comes after a word in the Genitive -6th-Case in construction in the sense of 'a modification thereof'.
The word विकार means the change of condition of the original. The word तस्य, though its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been supplied from the previous <i>sutras</i>, has been repeated here, in order to show that the governing force of शेषे [[4.2.92]] does not extend further. The affixes taught, therefore, under शेषे ([[4.2.92]] &c), such as घ, ख &c. have not the sense of तस्य विकार ॥

No affix has been taught here in this <i>sutra</i>: the general affix अण् [[4.1.83]] therefore will come in this sense, as well as the affixes to be taught hereafter. To give an example under this <i>sutra</i>, we must take such a word which is not governed or provided for, by the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. That is the word must not denote a living animal for to it अञ् [[4.3.154]] applies; it must have <i>udatta</i> on the first syllable, for an <i>anudattadi</i> will have अञ् [[4.3.140]]; it must not have a <i>Vriddhi</i> vowel आ, ऐ, or औ in the first syllable, to which मयट् [[4.3.144]] applies; and it must not be a word specifically mentioned in any one of the following aphorisms. Thus it applies to the words अश्मन् and भस्मन् formed by मनिन् (<i>Un</i>IV. 146,145) and to मृतिका formed by तिकन् [[5.4.39]] which are <i>adyudatta</i> owing to नित् accent. Thus अश्मनो विकारः = आश्मनः ॥ The टि is sometimes elided. ([[6.4.144]] <i>Vart</i>) As आश्मः ॥ So also भास्मनः and मार्तिकः ॥
