The affix मयट् comes after the word गो in the sense of 'its dung'.
Thus गोमयम् 'cow dung'. 'Dung' is neither a modification nor a part of cow.
Therefore this separate <i>sutra</i> for गो ॥ Why do we say meaning 'its dung'? Observe गव्यं = milk. The affix यत् here comes in the sense of product or part. [[4.3.160]], though strictly speaking 'milk' also is not an '<i>avayava</i>' or a '<i>vikara</i>' of गो ॥
