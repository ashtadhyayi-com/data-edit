The affix मयट् does not come in the छन्दस् (Vedas) after the disyllabic words having a short vowel उ in them, nor after the words 1. वर्ध्र and 2. बिल्वा।
Thus मौञ्जं शिक्यम् from मुञ्ज by अण् ॥ गार्मुतं चक्रम्, वार्ध्री बालप्रग्रथिता भवति; बैल्वो ब्रह्मवर्चसकामेन कार्यः ॥

The word उत्वत् means 'having उत् or short u [[1.1.70]]' The rule does not apply to words containing long ऊ, as भूममयान्यभ्राणि ॥ The वत् in उत्वत् shows that the rule applies not only to words ending in उ, but also to words having उ. Had वत् not been used, the <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> would require the application of the rule to words ending in उ, but not to those which had उ in any other part of their form. So that the prohibition applies to वेणु also, as वैणवी यष्टिः [[4.3.136]].

The word मुञ्ज is <i>ady</i>-<i>udatta</i> by तृणधान्यानां (<i>Phit</i> II.4): and therefore it takes the universal अण् [[4.3.134]]. The word गर्मुत् is formed by the affix उत् plus the augment मुट् (मृग्रोरुतिः, ग्रोमुट्च <i>Un</i> I.94 and 95), and is finally acute, and therefore it takes अञ् by [[4.3.140]], and forms गार्मुत ॥ This word has acute on the final also, as तस्या एतं गार्मुतं चरुं निर्वयेत् ॥ The word वर्ध्र is <i>ady</i>-<i>udatta</i> by <i>Phit</i> II.19. And therefore takes अण्, the feminine being formed by ङीप् [[4.1.15]].
