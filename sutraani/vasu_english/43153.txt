The affix अण् comes after a word denoting 'gold' when the sense is a weight or measure.
The word जातरूप means 'gold'. It is used in the plural in the <i>sutra</i>, indicating that all words synonymous with gold are to be taken.

This debars मयट् &c. Thus हाटको निष्कः, हाटकं कार्षापणम्, जातरूपम्, तापमीयम् ॥

Why do we say 'meaning a measure'. Observe यष्टिरियं हाटकमयी ॥
