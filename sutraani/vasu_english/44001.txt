The affix ठक् comes as a governing affix in the senses enumerated hereafter up to sūtra [[4.4.76]].
This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>. The affix ठक् bears rule from this one forward to the <i>sutra</i> तद्वहति &c. Thus in the next <i>sutra</i> it is said; "After a word in the third case in construction", in the sense of "who plays, digs, conquers, or is conquered." Now this <i>sutra</i> is incomplete. We must read the word ठक् into it. Thus अक्षै र्दीव्यति = आक्षिकः "who plays with <i>aksha</i>--a dicer." अक्ष + ठक् = आक्षिकः [[7.3.50]].

Vart:- After the words माशब्द &c, the affix '<i>thak</i>' comes in the sense 'he said that.' Thus माशब्द इत्याह = माशब्दिकः who says 'don't make noise,'  कार्यशब्दिकः ॥ This is the case of an affix added to a sentence.

Vart:- So also after प्रभूत &c in the sense 'he said': as प्रभूतमाह = प्राभूतिकः, पार्याप्तिकः ॥ These are examples of affixes added to an adverb.

Vart:- So also after सुस्नात &c in the sense 'he asks,' as, सुस्नातं पृच्छति = सौस्नातिकः "Who asks, have you bathed well". सौखराजिकः, सौखशायनिकः ॥

Vart:- So also after परदारा &c in the sense of 'he goes to, or commits adultery with': as परदारान् गच्छति = पारदारिकः, गौरुतल्पिकः ॥ The word तल्प here refers to "wife".
