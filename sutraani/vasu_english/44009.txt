The affix ष्ठल् comes in the sense of 'he goes on by means thereof' after the word आकर्ष।
This debars ठक् ॥ The ल् is for accent [[6.1.193]]. The ष of ष्ठल् here is a part of the affix, contrary to what it was in <i>sutra</i> 7 <i>ante</i>. To remove the doubt where ष is the part of an affix, and where it is not, the following mnemonic verse has been composed : "आकार्षत् पर्पादेभस्त्रादिभ्यः कुसीदसूत्राच्च, आवसथात् किक्षरादेः षितः षडेते ठगधिकारे ॥ In the six <i>Sutras</i> 9.10, 16.31, 74, and 53, the affixes have indicatory '<i>sh</i>' Here ष being इत्, the feminine is formed by ङीष् [[4.1.41]]. Thus आकर्षेण चरति = आकर्षिक f. आकर्षिकी ॥ आकर्ष is a  touch-stone by which gold is tested.
