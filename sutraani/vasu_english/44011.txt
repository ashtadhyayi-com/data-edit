The affixes ठञ् and ष्ठन् , come after the word श्वगण , in the sense of 'he goes by means thereof'.
This debars ठक् ॥ Thus श्वगणेन चरति = श्वागणिकः 'who lives by dogs'. f. श्वागणिकी ॥ ठन् श्वगणिकः f. श्वगणिका ॥

The form श्वागणिकः is evolved by the breach of rule [[7.3.4]]. Thus श्वगण + ठञ् ॥ Here by [[7.2.117]], ञ् requires <i>Vriddhi</i> of अ of श्व ॥ But rule [[7.3.4]] says that instead of <i>Vriddhi</i>, the letter औ comes before व in the case of श्वन् &c. The proper form, therefore, would have been शौवगणिकः ॥ The irregularity is, however, explained by saying that the prohibition contained in [[7.3.8]] which applies when श्वन् is followed by इञ्, applies also to श्वन् followed by ठञ् ॥ In fact, the rule [[7.3.4]] does not apply, whenever the word श्वन् is followed by an affix beginning with the letter इ ॥
