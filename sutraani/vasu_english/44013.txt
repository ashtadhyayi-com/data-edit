The affix ठन् comes in the sense of 'he lives thereby' after the words 1. वस्न 2. क्रय and 3. विक्रय being in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
This debars ठक् ॥ Thus वस्नेन जीवति = वस्निकः 'who lives by hire--hireling'. In the case of क्रय and विक्रय the affix is applied to the words separately, as well as to their compound. Thus क्रयविक्रयिकः, क्रयिकः, विक्रयिकः 'a trader'.
