The affix ष्ठन् optionally comes in the sense of 'he conveys' after the words 1. विवध and 2. वीवध being in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
In the altemative, the general affix ठक् will apply. Thus विवधेन हरति = वि꣡वधिकः f. विवधिकी॑; so also वी꣡वधिकः f. वीवधिकी꣡ ॥ When the affix is ठक्, we have वैवधिकः in both cases, the feminine being वैवधिकी꣡ ॥

The word विवध and वीवध are synomyms both meaning 'a piece of wood carried on the shoulders to carry loads, on the road.' विवधिकः meaning 'a carrier of loads, a pedler'. The real <i>sutra</i> is विभाषा विवधात्, the <i>Kasika</i> has added वीवध from a <i>Vartika</i>.
