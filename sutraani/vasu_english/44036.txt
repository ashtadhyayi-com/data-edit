The affix ठक् also comes in the sense of 'who stays' after the word परिपन्थ , the word being in the Accusative -2nd case in construction.
Thus परिपन्थं तिष्ठति = पारिपन्थिकः यः पन्थानं वर्जयित्वा तिष्ठति, यो वा पन्थानं व्याप्य तिष्ठति 'a thief' lit. "who stays at roads, a high way man". The च in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the sense of हन्ति 'who kills' of the last, is to be connected with this <i>sutra</i> by the conjunction 'and'. Thus परिपन्थं हन्ति = पारिपन्थिकः ॥

The phrase 'being in the second case in construction' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, why has then the word परिपन्थम् been shown in the second case in the <i>sutra</i>, for it is a mere superfluity? No, it shows the secular form of the word. The word परिपन्थ is synonymous with परिपन्थ, the latter, however, having other senses also.
