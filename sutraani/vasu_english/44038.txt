The affixes ठञ् and ठक् come after the word आक्रन्द being in the Accusative -2nd case in construction in the sense of 'who runs'.
The word आक्रन्द means 'a place where persons weep' e.g. a battle - field. It also means 'weeping' 'invoking' &c. The difference between ठक् and ठञ् in the accent. Thus आक्रन्दं धावति = आक्रन्दिकः꣡ or आ꣡क्रन्दिकः, f. आक्रन्दिकी 'a person who runs to a place where cries of distress are heard'.
