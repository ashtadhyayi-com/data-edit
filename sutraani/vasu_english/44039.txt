The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'who takes' after a word having पद as its second member, the word being in the Accusative -2nd case in construction.
Thus पूर्वपदं गृह्णाति = पौर्वपदिकः, so also औत्तरपदिकः ॥ The word उत्तरपद is used in order to prevent the application of the rule when पद is preceded by the affix बहु ॥
