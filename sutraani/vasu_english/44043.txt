The affix ठन् and ठक् comes after the words in the Accusative -2nd case in construction denoting combination in the sense 'who assembles there'.
The word समवाय means 'combination, collection &c'. The word समवायान् is in the plural number in the <i>sutra</i>, indicating that the <i>svarupa</i>-<i>vidhi</i> (1.1. 69) does not apply; the affix being applied not only to the word-form समवाय but to its synonyms also. समवैति means coming together. Thus समवायान् समवैति = सामवायिकः 'who assembles in an assembly'. So also सामाजिकः, सामूहिकः, सान्निवेशिकः ॥
