The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'who sees that' after the words 1. ललाट and 2. कुक्कुटी in the Accusative -2nd case in construction, the whole word being a Name.
Thus ललाटं पश्यति = लालाटिकः 'a non-attentive servant' lit. 'who alway looks at the fore-head of his master from a distance, keeps himself aloof, does not come near to perform any work.' So also कौक्कुटिकः 'a religious mendicant, a <i>Bhikshu</i>.' The space of ground over which a hen can fly without falling, is to be understood here by the word कुक्कुटी ॥ In other words, a small space of ground, for hens cannot sustain their flight for a long distance. Therefore, owing to the smallness of space, the mendicant walks looking down over the ground, and hence he is called कौक्कुटिकः ॥ The word also means 'a hypocrite with down-cast eyes.'
