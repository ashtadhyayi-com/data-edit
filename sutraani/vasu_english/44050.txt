The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'its tax' after a word in the Genitive -6th-Case in construction.
The word अवक्रय means 'Government-tax,' 'price,' 'wages,' 'rent' &c, coming from the root अवक्री 'to purchase.' Thus शुल्कशालाया अवक्रयः = शौल्कशालिकः So also आपणिकः, गौल्मिकः, आकरिकः ॥

Are not धर्म्य [[4.4.47]] and अवक्रय the same ? No. <i>Dharmya</i> is a legal due, and religious; while an '<i>avakraya</i>' may be a tax exacted from a people by oppression, and so transgressing <i>dharma</i>.
