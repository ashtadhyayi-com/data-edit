The affix ठक् comes after a word expressing food, in the Nominative 1st-Case in construction, in the sense of 'this is wholesome diet for whom'.
The words तद् and अस्य [[4.4.5]] are understood. The word हितं governs dative (II.3.13, <i>Vart</i>). But the <i>sutra</i> is तदस्य हितं भक्षाः, the word अस्य being in the genitive case, how is this? Here अस्य should be changed to dative viz. तदस्मै हितं भक्षाः 'this for whom is wholesome diet'. The best way however, to remove this objection is to read <i>sutras</i> [[4.4.65]], and [[4.4.66]] in this wise: [[4.4.65]] हितं भक्षाः तदस्मै and दीयते नियुक्तं ॥ Thus अपूपंभक्षणं हितमस्मै = आपूपिकः 'He for whom cake is good food' i. e. who eats cakes with benefit, or who is fond of cakes. So also शाष्कुलिकः, मौदकिकः ॥ In analysing these <i>taddhitas</i>, such as आपूपिकः &c, the word हितं or its synonym, and a verb denoting eating should be employed.
