The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'to whom this is to be given rightfully' after a word expressing the thing to be given, in the Nominative 1st-Case (तद्) in construction, the force of the affix being that of a Dative -4th Case.
The word दीयते नियुक्तम् means नियोगेन i.e. अव्यभिचारेण दीयते 'to be given by appointment or rightfully'. Thus अग्रे भोजनमस्मै नियुक्तं दीयते = आग्रभोजनिकः 'a <i>Brahmana</i> always entitled to occupy the foremost seat at dinner'. So also आपूपिकः 'entitled to get cakes', शाष्कुलिकः ॥ Some say that the word नियुक्तं means नित्यं 'always'. According to them आपूपिकः would mean अपूपा नित्यमस्मै दीयन्ते 'to whom always cakes are given'.
