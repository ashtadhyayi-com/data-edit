The affix टिठन् comes in the sense of 'to whom this is given rightfully' after the words 1. श्राणा and 2. मांसौदन।
This टिठन् debars ठक् ॥ The इ of टि is for the sake of pronunciation, the ट् indicates that the feminine is formed by ङीप् [[4.1.154]]. Thus श्राणा नियुक्तमस्मै दीयते = श्राणिकः f. श्राणिकी 'who is entitled to get rice gruel'. So also मांसौदनिकः f. मांसौदनिकी ॥

The difference between ठक् and टिठन् is in accent, the former having <i>udatta</i> on the final [[6.1.165]], the latter on the initial [[6.1.197]]. The feminine of ठक् and टिठन् will both be formed by ङीप् [[4.1.15]]. Now the affix ठञ् resembles टिठन् both in accent [[6.1.197]] and in feminine [[4.1.15]]. Why was not ठञ् used instead of टिठन्, for it would have produced exactly the same forms ? True, as regards the words श्राणा and मांसौदन the affix ठञ् might have been employed instead of टिठन् ॥ According to some, however, the affix टिठन् applies to मांस and ओदन separately also. But ठञ् cannot be applied to ओदन as it would cause <i>Vriddhi</i> [[7.2.117]] which टिठन् does not. Thus ओदन् + टिठन् = ओदनिकः, f. ओदनिकी ॥ With ठञ् the form would have been औदनिकः which is not wanted.

The word श्राणा is a Past Participle (क्त) of श्राणा 'to cook.' The श्रा is not changed to श्रृ as required by [[6.1.27]]. This is an anomaly. The <i>nistha</i> त is changed to ण [[8.2.43]]. The form श्राता is also found, as in [[6.1.36]], and the regular form is शृतं = क्षीरम् [[6.1.27]].
