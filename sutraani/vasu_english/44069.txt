The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'appointed there' after a word in the Locative -7th case (तत्र) in construction.
Thus शुल्कशालायां नियुक्तः = शौल्कशालिकः 'a superintendent of custom-house.' So also आकरिकः, आपणिकः, गौलूमिकः, दौवारिकः ॥ The word तत्रनियुक्त is a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound formed by [[2.1.46]]. The word <i>niyukta</i> here has a different meaning from that in [[4.1.60]], hence its repetition here.
