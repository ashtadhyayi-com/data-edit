The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'what bears it' after the words 1. रथ 2. युग and 3. प्रासङ्ग being in the Accusative -2nd case in construction.
Thus रथं वहति = र꣡थ्यः 'what bears a car' a carriage-horse. Similarly यु꣡ग्यः 'a yoke-bearing ox', प्रासंग्यः 'being trained in a break'. प्रासङ्ग is a piece of wood placed on the neck of colts, at the time of breaking. This rule applies to compounds ending with <i>ratha</i>, as, परमरथ्य ॥ See [[4.3.121]], [[4.3.123]] also. That which carries will be called 'carrier' or वोढृ therefore रथस्य वोढृ will get the affix यत् by [[4.2.120]], read with [[4.3.121]]. Its special mention here indicates that the affix will come, even after <i>Dvigu</i> compounds and will not be elided by [[4.1.88]]. Thus द्वौ रथौ वहति = द्विरथ्यः ॥ The <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies to this word as we have shown under [[4.3.121]]. The word युग्य has been already formed by the <i>krit</i> affix [[3.1.121]], that युग्य differs from the present, in accent when the word takes the negative particle, for that was by ल्यप् and this is by यत्, and therefore by [[6.2.156]], अयुग्य꣡म् will be finally acute when formed by यत् ॥ The word युगं must mean 'the portion of a car' for the application of this rule, and not a cycle of time &c. Therefore not here युगं वहति राजा कलिं द्वापरं वा ॥
