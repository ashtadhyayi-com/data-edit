The affixes यत् and ढक् comes in the sense of 'what bears it' after the word धुर in the Accusative -2nd case in construction.
Thus धुरं वहति = धुर्यः (formed by यत्) the lengthening ordained by [[8.2.77]] is prevented by [[7.2.79]] because धुर is <i>Bha</i>-stem, or धौरेयः (formed by डक् [[7.1.2]]) 'a beast of burden'. This <i>sutra</i> might have stood as धुरो ढक् च, for यत् would have been read into it from [[4.4.75]].
