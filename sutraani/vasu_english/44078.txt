The affix ख comes in the sense of 'what bears it' after the word सर्वधुरा being in Accusative -2nd case construction.
Thus सर्वधुरां वहति = सर्वधुरीणः [[7.1.2]]. The affix ख applies to other compounds also ending in धुर, e.g. उत्तरधुरीणः, दक्षिनधुरीणः ॥ The word सर्वधुर is a compound of सर्वा + धुर् [[2.1.49]], the <i>samasanta</i> अ being added by [[5.4.74]]. The word धूः being feminine, the whole compound would be feminine by [[2.4.26]]. The word सर्वधुरात् in the <i>sutra</i> should not be taken, therefore, as regulating the gender, for though it is in the masculine gender, the affix comes after the feminine word. In fact सर्वधुर in the <i>sutra</i> should be taken as a nominal-stem or <i>pratipadika</i> equal to सवधुरा ॥
