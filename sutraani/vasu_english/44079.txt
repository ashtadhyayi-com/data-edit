The affix ख comes in the sense of 'what bears it' after the word एकधुरा being in Accusative -2nd case construction, the affix is optionally elided too.
The elision is optional. Thus एकधुरां वहति = एकधुरीणः or एकधुरः ॥ The compounding is <i>taddhitartha</i> (एकां धुरं वहति) to which is added the <i>samasanta</i> अ, and then the affix ख ॥
