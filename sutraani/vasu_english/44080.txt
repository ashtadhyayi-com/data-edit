The affix अण् comes in the sense of 'what bears it' after the word शकट being in Accusative -2nd case construction.
Thus शकटं वहति = शाकटः 'an ox' i. e. what bears a car. This could be evolved by तस्येदम् अण् as शाकटस्य वोढ = शाकटः ॥ The specification indicates that <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies here, as द्वे शकटे वहति = द्वैशकटः, and the affix is not elided [[4.1.88]].
