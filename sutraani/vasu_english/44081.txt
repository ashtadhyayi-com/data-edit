The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'what bears it' after the words 1. हल and 2. सीर in Accusative -2nd case construction.
Thus हलं वहति = हालिकः a ploughman सैरिकः 'a plough ox.' The ठक् would have come by [[4.3.124]], the specification shows <i>tadantavidhi</i> and non-elision, as द्वैहालिकः, त्रैसीरिकः ॥
