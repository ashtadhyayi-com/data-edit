The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'whose root is eradicated' after the word मूल being in the Nominative 1st-Case in construction.
The word आबर्हि from वृहू 'to up root,' means 'uprooting,' = उत्पाटनं ॥ मूलमेषामाबर्हि = मू꣡ल्याः 'a kind of pulse' e. g. माषा । मुद्गाः ॥ These cereals cannot be harvested without uprooting the whole plant. According to <i>Padamanjari</i> the word should be आवर्हि and not आबर्हि, with a व and not ब ॥
