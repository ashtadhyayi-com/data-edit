The affix ञ्य comes in the sense of 'joined with' after the word गृहपति in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
Thus गृहपतिना संयुक्तः = गार्हपत्यः 'the <i>Garhapatya</i> Fire': i. e. a Fire particularly consecrated by the Householder. The word संज्ञायां of the last <i>sutra</i> should be read into it, thus गार्हपत्यः means a particular Fire, and not every thing relating to a गृहपति ॥ The Fire in which husband (<i>grihapati</i>), together with or joined with his wife, performs sacrifice is called <i>Garhapatya</i>. That sacrifice cannot be performed in Dakshinagni. Or that fire in which <i>Grihapati</i> hymns are recited is called <i>Garhapatya</i>.
