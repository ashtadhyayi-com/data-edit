The affix यत् comes after the words 1. नौ 'a boat' 2. वयस् 'age' 3. धर्म 'merit' 4. विष 'poison' 5. मूल 'a root' 6. मूल 'a capital' 7. सीता 'a furrow' and 8. तुला 'a balance', in the senses respectively of 1. 'to be crossed' 2. 'like' 3. 'attainable' 4. 'to be put to death' 5. 'to be bent down' 6. 'equivalent to' 7. 'united with' and 8. 'equally measured'.
The words in the above must be all in the Instrumental case in construction, for the sense of the affix shows that it should be so. Thus.

1. नावा तार्यम् = नाव्यम् 'water' 'a river', lit what can be crossed by a boat.

2. वयसा तुल्यः = वयस्यः 'a friend', lit. one alike in age.

3. धर्मेण प्राप्यम् = धर्म्यम् 'what is attainable through <i>dharma</i>. Could not this form have been evolved by the next <i>sutra</i> धर्मादनपेते [[4.4.92]] ? No, धर्म्यम् formed by that aphorism means 'what is consistent with <i>dharma</i>' 'what is just'. The present धर्म्य refers to the 'fruit', the other to the 'act'.

4. विषेण वध्यः = विष्यः 'who deserves to be put to death by poison'.

5. मूलेनानाम्यम् = मूल्यम् "price" lit. or to be overpowered or bent by the root". The word आनाम्य (which is formed from the root नम् 'to bow' by the affix ण्यत् contrary to rule [[3.1.98]] which reguired यत्), means अभिभवनीयम् 'what ought to be overpowered': hence मूल्यम् means 'the price, worth, cost', because articles like 'cloth' &c are produced by the out-lay of stock or capital (मूल); 'price' being a thing which, because it is capital plus profit, is superior to capital, and thus by price or <i>mulyam</i>, the capital or <i>mula</i> is overpowered.

6. मूलेन समः = मूल्यः 'purchasable' lit, equivalent to capital' e.g. cloth पटः i. e. equivalent acquisition resulting from the employment of capital.

7. सीतया समितं = सीत्यं 'a field'. lit. 'measured out by furrows' according to Dr Ballantyne. The word समितं is equivalent to संगतं 'united with according to <i>Kasika</i>. सीत्यं therefore literally means 'a ploughed field' i. e. 'what is united with furrows'. The affix will apply also to words ending with सीता, e.g. परमसीत्यं, उत्तमसीत्यं, द्विसीत्यं ॥

8. तुलया सम्मितं = तुल्यम् "equal" lit. 'meted by the balance'. सम्मित means समानं, सदृशं ॥

Note:- The fruits of good deeds, like happiness &c, which are attainable or <i>prapya</i> through '<i>dharma</i>', may be said also <i>dharmad</i> <i>anapetam</i> because an effect must have a cause. Hence arises the doubt as to what is the difference between this and the next <i>sutra</i>. The '<i>anapetam</i>' in the next <i>sutra</i> means tho fulfilling or following the Law established by the <i>Shishthas</i>, and has no reference to its fruits. Because the effect of <i>dharma</i> in to destroy <i>dharma</i>-- i.e. the fruits in the shape of happiness &c lessen, and ultimately extinguish the <i>dharma</i>. Therefore, the fruit of <i>dharma</i>, which is to be taken in this <i>sutra</i>, as referred to by the word <i>prapya</i>, ia diametrically opposed to the practising of <i>dharma</i>, referred to by the word <i>anapeta</i> of the next <i>sutra</i>.
