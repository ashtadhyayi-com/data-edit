The affixes अण् and यत् come in the sense of 'made' after उरस् in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
The यत् is drawn into the <i>sutra</i> by the particle च ॥ उरसा निर्मितः = औरसं꣡ 'own son not adopted, lit. produced through the loins,' With यत् the form will be उरस्यः॑ ॥ These words denote son, and not anything produced from the loin, because the word संज्ञायां [[4.4.89]] governs this <i>sutra</i> also.
