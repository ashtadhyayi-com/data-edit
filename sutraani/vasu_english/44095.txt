The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'loved' after the word हृदय being in the Genitive -6th-Case in construction.
The construction is shown by the aphorism itself. Thus हृदयस्य प्रियः = हृ꣡द्यः 'pleasant to the heart' e. g. हृद्यो देशः, हृद्यं वनम् ॥ But we cannot say हृद्यः पुत्रः, the word संज्ञायां [[4.4.99]] governs this <i>sutra</i> also, and thus restricts the meaning of the word.
