The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'resident therein' after the word समानतीर्थ in the Locative -7th case construction.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of साधुः now ceases. The word तीर्थ means here गुरु 'Preceptor'. Thus समाने तीर्थे वासी = सतीर्थ्यः [[6.3.87]]-- 'a fellow-student', who both dwell under the same preceptor.
