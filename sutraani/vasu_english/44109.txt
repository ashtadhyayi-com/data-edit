The affix य comes in the sense of 'who sleeps' after the word सोदर the word being in the Locative -7th case in construction.
By <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.88]] समान is optionally changed to स before the word उदर when यत् follows. Thus समानोदरे शयितः = सोर्द॒यः꣡ ॥ Here ओ is not <i>udatta</i>, as it was in the last; the <i>udatta</i> here falls on य ॥
