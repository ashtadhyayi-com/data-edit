The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'what stays here' in the छन्दस् (Vedas) when in the Locative -7th case in construction.
This debars अण्, घ &c [[4.3.53]]. Those affixes also are employed in the alternative, there being much latitude of grammatical rules in the Vedas. Thus the words मेघ्यः꣡ and विदुत्य॑ in the following hymn of the <i>Yajur</i> <i>Veda</i> (16. V. 38): नमा॒ मेघ्या॑य च विदुत्या॒य च॒ ॥ All the <i>sutras</i> henceforward up to the end of the chapter, are Vedic <i>sutras</i>, the word छन्दसि being understood in them all. The word भवे governs all the <i>sutras</i> up to [[4.4.118]].
