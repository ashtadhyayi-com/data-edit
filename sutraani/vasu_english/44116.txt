The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'what stays there' after the word अग्र , in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
Thus अग्रे भवं = अ꣡ग्र्यम् ॥ Why this separate rule for यत् would have come after अग्र by the general rule [[4.4.110]] ? The repetition is to show that यत् is not debarred by घ and छ of the next <i>sutra</i>, which would have been the case, had this <i>sutra</i> not existed.
