The affix घ comes in the sense of 'what stays there' after the words 1. समुद्र and 2. अभ्र , in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
This debars यत् ॥ Thus समुद्रियः and अभ्रियः, as in समुद्रिया अप्सरसो मनीषिणम् and नानदतो अभ्रियस्येव घोषाः ॥ The word '<i>abhra</i>' being a word of fewer syllables than '<i>samudra</i>' ought to have come first. Its coming as a second member is an irregularity.
