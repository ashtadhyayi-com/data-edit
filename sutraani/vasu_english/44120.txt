The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'its share' or 'its duty' after the word दूत in the Genitive -6th-Case in construction, in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
Thus दूत्यम् 'the share of a messenger or the work of a messenger'. As यत्ते अग्रे दूत्यम् ॥ According to [[6.1.213]], the accent will be दू꣡त्यम्, but the accented Text reads दूत्यम्॑ ॥
