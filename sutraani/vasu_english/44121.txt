The affix यत् comes in the sense of 'killer' after the words 1. रक्षा and 2. यातू in the Genitive -6th-Case in construction, in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
That by which anything is killed is called हननी ॥ Thus रक्षस्य॑ and यातव्य॑ meaning 'that which kills the demons called <i>Rakshas</i> and <i>Yatus</i>'. As याते अग्ने रक्षस्या तनः i. e. रक्षसां हननी 'O <i>Agni</i> thy bodies are killers of <i>Rakshas</i>'. So यातव्याः तनूः ॥ The word is in the plural as a mark of respect.
