The affix ख comes after the words 1. वेशोभग and 2. यशोभग in the छन्दस् (Vedas) with the force of मतुप्।
Thus देशोभगीनः and यशोभगीनः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> has been separated from last in order to prevent the application of the यथासंख्य rule [[1.3.10]]. For had the <i>sutra</i> been वेशोयश आदेर्भगाद् यल्खौ, as it occurs in <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>, then the affix यल् would apply to देशोभग, and the affix ख to यशोभगः which is not what is intended. Another reason for making it a distinct aphorism is that the <i>anuvritti</i> of ख runs in the next <i>sutra</i>, not so of यल् ॥
