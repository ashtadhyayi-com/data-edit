The affix य comes in the sense of 'who deserves that' after the word सोम in the Accusative -2nd case in construction, in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
Thus सोममर्हन्ति = सौम्या ब्राह्मणाः "The <i>Brahmanas</i> who deserve <i>Soma</i>" i. e. honorable and learned, and worthy of performing sacrifices. The difference between यत् and घ is in accent.
