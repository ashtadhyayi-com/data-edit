From this one forward to तेन कृतम् [[6.1.37]], the affix छ bears the rule.
The affix छ has the various senses taught in these thirty-seven <i>sutras</i> (V. 1. 1.) to [[5.1.37]]. Thus in the <i>Sutra</i> तस्मैहितं 'suitable for that', [[5.1.5]]. the word छ must be read to complete the sense. Thus वत्सेभ्योहितो = वत्सीयो गोधुक्, करभीय उष्ट्रः, अकरभीयः, अवत्सीयः ॥ The limitation of the jurisdiction of छ has been indicated in the <i>sutra</i> with regard to the meaning of the affix, and not with regard to the affix. As an affix, छ has no force beyond <i>Sutra</i> 17, the affix ठञ् being the ruling affix thereafter.
