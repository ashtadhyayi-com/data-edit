The affix (-/- -क) comes after a Numeral, when it does not end with ति or शत् , in the sense of the affix being that taught hereafter up to [[5.1.63]]
The word आर्हात् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> also. The word संख्या is defined in (l. 1. 23). This कन् debars ठञ् ॥ Thus पंचभिः क्रीतः = पंचकः, बहुकः, गणकः ॥

Why do we say 'when it does not end in ति or शत्'? Observe सा꣡प्ततिकः चा꣡त्वारिशतकः formed by ठञ् ॥ But why कतिकः is formed by कन् and not by ठञ् or ठक्, as the word कति also ends in ति? The word कति is formed by adding the affix डति, while the rule applies to the numerals which in their primitive state end with ति such as सप्ततिः, अशीतिः, विंशति &c. Here apply the two maxims अर्थवद्ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य 'a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning;' and निरनुबन्धक ग्रहणे न सानुबन्धकस्य 'when a term void of <i>Anubandhas</i> is employed in Grammar, it does not denote that which has an <i>Anubandha</i> attached to it'. Therefore when ति is taken, it does not mean डति॥
