The affix is added to a word in the first case (तद्) in construction. The sense of the affix is that of a locative (अस्मिन्). The word दीयते 'is given' in the singular number joins with each one of the word वृद्धि, आय &c. The sum paid by a debtor to his creditor over and above the principal, is called वृद्धि or interest. The share of profit taken by landlord in villages &c. is called आय or rent. The increase over the capital by sale of cloth &c. is called लाभ or profit. The share of the king for protection &c. is called शुल्क or tax. The present or bribe is called उपदा ॥ Thus पंचास्मिन् वृद्धिर्वा आयो वा लाभो वा शुल्को वा उपदा वा दीयते = पंचकः 'that transaction &c. in which five percent is given as interest, rent, profit tax or bribe'. Similarly सप्तकः, शत्यः, शतिकः, साहस्रः &c.

Vart:- So also in the sense of a Dative. As पंचास्मै वृद्धिर्वा आयो वा लाभो वा उपदा वा दीयते = पंचको देवदत्तः "<i>Devadatta</i> to whom five percent is given as Interest &c". This <i>Vartika</i> may be redundant, if we take the locative as sometimes having the force of dative also. As in the sentence सममब्राह्मणे दानं ॥
