The word अधीष्ट means "honorary office", therefore 'one solicited to teach, but who accepts no pay' [[3.3.161]], भृतः means "engaged on wages", भूतः means 'the time pervaded or occupied by its existence', and भावी the same as last in the future. The word denoting time will be in the second case by [[2.3.5]]. Thus मासमधीष्टः = मासिकोऽध्यापकः, so also मासंभृतः = मासिकः कर्मकरः, मासंभूतः = मासिको व्याधिः, मासंभावी = मासिक उत्सवः ॥

Q. The solicitation (अध्येषण) and hiring (भरण) only take a short time, how can these acts extend over a month ?

A. It is not these acts, but their results which extend over a month, such as, teaching and serving.
