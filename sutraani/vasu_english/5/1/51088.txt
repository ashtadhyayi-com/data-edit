The affix ख as well as ठञ् come in the five fold senses [[5.1.79]], [[5.1.80]], after the word वर्षा forming a <i>Dvigu</i>; and these two affixes may also be elided optionally. Thus we have three forms; द्विवर्षीणो, द्विवार्षिकी or द्विवर्षो व्याधिः 'a disease that lasted two years'. Compare [[7.3.16]]; but when the sense is that of भावी, the form will be द्वैवर्षिकः ॥
