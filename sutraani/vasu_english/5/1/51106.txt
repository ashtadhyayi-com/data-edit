In the छन्दस् (Vedas) the affix घस् (इय) comes in the sense of 'season has come for it' After the verbs the word ऋतु।
This debars अण्. As अयं ते योनिरृत्वियः ॥ Here there is no <i>Guna</i> by [[6.4.146]], because by <i>sutra</i> (1. 4. 16), ऋतु before the affix घस् gets the designation of पद, hence the <i>guna</i> rule which applies to भ (1.4. 18) does not apply.
