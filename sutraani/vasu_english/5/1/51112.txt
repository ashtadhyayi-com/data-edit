The affix छ (ईय) comes in the same sense of 'that whose purpose is this' after the word समापन when it has a word in composition preceding it.
This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus छन्दः समापनं प्रयोजनमस्य = छन्दः समापनीयम्, व्याकरण समापनीयम् ॥ The specific mention of the word पद in the aphorism indicates that the rule will not apply when a word other than a '<i>pada</i>,' such as the affix '<i>bahuch</i>,' (V. 3. 68.) precedes the word <i>Samapana</i>.
