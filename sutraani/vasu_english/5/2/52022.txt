The word साप्तपदीन comes from सप्तपद but the connection of senses is not very clear. It is said सप्तभिः पदैरवाप्यते = साप्तपदीनम् "formed by walking together seven steps or by talking together seven words". The circumambulation of the Fire by the bride and bridegroom in seven steps makes the marriage irrevocable. साप्तपदीनं seems to have some connection with that. The word साप्तपदीनः or म् means 'a friend' also; the abstract sense being made applicable by analogy to the person as well.
