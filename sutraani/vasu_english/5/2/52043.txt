The affix अयच् is optionally the substitute of तयप् after the words 1. द्वि and 2. त्रि।
As द्वाववयवावस्य = द्वयम् or द्वितयम्, त्रयम् or त्रितयम् 'a couple' 'a triad' [[6.4.148]].

The word तय is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate the <i>sthanin</i> or thing to be replaced. Had it not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have run thus द्वित्रिभ्यामयज् वा "<i>ayach</i> optionally comes after <i>dvi</i> and <i>tri</i>". Here <i>ayach</i> would have become a separate affix, instead of being a mere substitute. Where is the harm in its being a separate affix? Then the word त्रयम् or द्वयम् will not form their feminine in ङीप्; but अय being taken as <i>sthanivat</i> to तय (1. 1. 56), the affix ङीप् which by [[4.1.15]], applies to तय, applies to अय also. Thus we have त्रयी गतिः ॥ Moreover by [[1.1.33]], words ending in तय are declined as Pronouns optionally before nominative plural termination. By the rule of <i>sthanivat</i> <i>adesa</i> [[1.1.56]], the words ending in अय will also be Pronouns. As द्वये or द्वयाः त्रये or त्रयाः ॥ The च् in अयच् is for accent, showing that the substitute '<i>aya</i>' differs in accent from the <i>sthani</i> <i>taya</i>.
