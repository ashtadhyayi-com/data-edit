The affix तीय comes in the sense of 'completer thereof' after the word त्रि and there is सम्प्रसारण (Vocalisation) of the stem.
The substitution of a vowel for a semi-vowel is <i>samprasarana</i> (I. I. 45). Thus त्रि + तीय = तृ + इ + तीय = तृतीयः ([[6.1.108]], the इ of त्रि assumes the form of the prior letter ऋ which is substituted for र्). In तृतीयः the ऋ is not lengthened by [[6.4.2]], because that rule applies to the lengthening of the अण् letters only, this word being read into [[6.4.2]], by <i>anuvritti</i> from (VI. 3. III). The <i>pratyahara</i> अण् is formed by the first ण्, and means the letters अ, इ and उ ॥
