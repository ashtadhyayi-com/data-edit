Thus तापसः, साहस्रः ॥ The separation of this <i>sutra</i> from the last is for two purposes, Ist the <i>anuvritti</i> of अण् runs in the subsequent <i>sutras</i>, which could not have been done had it been included in the last <i>sutra</i>, 2nd the rule of <i>yathasankhya</i> (1. 3. 10) would not have applied in the last <i>sutra</i>, had अण् been read along with विनि and इनि ॥

Vart:- The words ज्योत्स्ना &c, are governed by this rule and take अण्. As ज्योत्स्ना विद्यतेऽस्मिन् पक्षे = ज्यौत्स्नः पक्षः ॥ Similarly तामिस्रः (a kind of hell) कौण्डलः, कौतपः, वैसर्पः, and वैपादिकः ॥
