Thus पञ्चमोऽस्यास्ति मासः संवत्सरो वा = पंचमिन् 'five months or years old', as पंचमी उष्ट्रः ॥ Similarly नवमी, दशमी &c. By [[5.2.115]] the affix इनि would have come after these words; the present <i>sutra</i> is a restrictive rule teaching that ठन् does not come in this sense.

Why do we say वयसि 'when age is denoted'? Observe, पंचमवान् ग्रामरागः ॥
