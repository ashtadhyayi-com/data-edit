The affixes herein taught do not change the sense of the word, i.e. they are स्वार्ध affixes which leave to the word their own denotation. The rule [[4.1.82]], extends no further than this, hence the words formed by these affixes do not produce epithets connoting the sense of the primitive and denoting something else.

Thus [[5.3.7]] declares, that after the words किम् in the ablative there is the affix तसिल्, as कुतः, ततः, यतः ॥

The purpose served by designating these affixes as <i>Vibhakti</i> is (a) to debar the elision of final स् and म् of the affixes as इत् (1. 3. 4). Thus in the affix दानीम् [[5.3.18]], म् is not इत्, had it been so, rule [[1.1.47]] would have applied: (b) to regulate the accent of इदम्, thus इदम् + तसिल् = इतः here by (VI. I. 171), the affix तसिल् becomes <i>udatta</i> by virtue of its being <i>Vibhakti</i>, othewise the accent would have been regulated by the indicatory ल् (VI. I. 193); (c) to make applicable to these words the rules of त्यदादि, that is, the rules given in the <i>Sutras</i> [[7.2.102]], and those that follow. Thus त्यद् + तसिल् = त्यतः, the द being replaced by अ by [[7.2.102]].

The affixes now to be taught being स्वार्थिकः, the <i>anuvritti</i> of समर्थानाम् and प्रथमाद् of (IV. I. 82), does not apply to them. The word वा of [[4.1.82]] however applies here, so that these affixes are optional, thus we may have कुतः or कस्मात्, कुत्र or कस्मिन् ॥
