The <i>sutra</i> [[5.3.2]], is to be read into this. The <i>anuvritti</i> of सप्तम्याः and काले ceases. The word प्रकार means the differentiating quality distinguishing a species among the genus : it means 'sort', 'kind', 'mode', 'manner' &c. Thus तेन प्रकारेण = तथा 'so, in that manner'. Similarly यथा, सर्वथा ॥ The affix जातीयर् taught in [[5.3.69]] has also the same force, with this difference that <i>jatiyar</i> applies to words which denote things possessing such a quality (प्रकारयाच्च, while <i>thal</i> denotes mode itself. Therefore, one does not debar the other, so that we have forms like, तथाजातीयः and यथाजातीयः ॥
