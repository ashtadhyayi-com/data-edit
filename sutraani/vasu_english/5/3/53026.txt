The word प्रकार वचने is read into the <i>sutra</i> by force of च ॥ Thus कथा 'wherefore? why? for what reason?', कथा 'how'. The former is an example of हेतु 'reason or cause', the second of प्रकार 'manner'. As in the following sentences : कथा ग्रामं न पृच्छसि = केन हेतुना ग्रामं न पृच्छसि ॥ कथा देवा आसन् पुराविदः ॥

Here end the affixes having the designation of <i>Vibhakti</i>.
