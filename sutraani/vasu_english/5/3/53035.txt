The affix अस्ताति and the other affixes taught above come with the force of locative, ablative and nominative. The एनप् comes with the force of locative and nominative and not that of ablative. The adverbs so formed refer to objects not at a distance. Thus उत्तरेण or उत्तरात् or उत्तरतो वसति or रमणीयम् ॥ Similarly अधरेण, अधरात्, अधस्ताद् वसति &c, so also दक्षिणेन, दक्षिणात्, दक्षिणतो वसति &c, 'He lives near by in the north-ward or southward'. Why do we say 'when not denoting distance'. Observe उत्तराद्वस्ति 'he lives far away in the north'. Why do we say 'when not having the force of ablative'? Observe उत्तरादागतः 'come from the north'.

The word अपञ्चम्याः governs all the succeeding <i>sutras</i> upto [[5.3.39]], exclusive. Some do not read उत्तर &c into this <i>sutra</i>: according to them this is a general rule applicable to all words denoting direction. As पूर्वेण ग्रामम्, अपरेण ग्रामम् [[2.3.31]]. The प् in <i>enap</i> is for the sake of accent [[3.1.4]].
