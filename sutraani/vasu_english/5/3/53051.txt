The word मान means a grain weight (व्रीहि परिमितं सुवर्ण). That is to say, कन् comes after षष्ठ when a division of मान 'measure' is expressed; and लुक् comes after अष्ट when a part of पश्वङ्ग is denoted. Thus ष꣡ष्ठको भागः 'a sixth of a grain measure'. अष्टमो भागः 'an-eighth part of the body of a beast'. The लुक् here takes the place of the affix ञ as well as अन् ॥ By च, the affixes above mentioned are also employed: as षाष्ठः or षष्ठः, आष्टमः or अष्टमः ॥ When a measure or the body of an animal is not denoted, this rule (though optional) will not apply.
