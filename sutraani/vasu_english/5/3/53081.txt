The affix कन् is added to a Name of a human being which expresses a special idea when compassion or courtesy is meant.
The जातिनामन् are words like व्याघ्र &c which are well-known names of particular species of animals &c, but which are come to be applied to men by way of metaphor. The <i>anuvritti</i> of बह्वचः does not extend to it. This is a general rule. Thus व्याघ्रकः, सिंहकः, शरमकः ॥ The word वा being understood in the <i>sutra</i>, the previous affixes also come, as, व्याघ्रिलः, सिंहिलः ॥ The word नामन् is used along with जाति, to prevent the affix being added to the word-form जाति (1. 1. 68).
