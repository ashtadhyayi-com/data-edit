This affix comes in the <i>svartha</i> sense. The differentiation of a portion from the whole by means of its peculiar caste, action, attribute or name is called निर्द्धारण or specification. Thus कतरो भवतोः कठः 'amongst you two, who is <i>Katha</i>'. कतरो भवतोः कारकः 'amongst you two, who is the agent'. कतरो भवतोः पटुः 'amongst you two, who is clever'. कतरो भवतोः देवदत्तः 'which of the two amongst you is <i>Devadatta</i>'. Similarly यतरः 'of the two the one who', ततरः 'of the two--that one'. as यतरो भवतो देवदत्तः, ततर आगच्छतु 'of the two, let that one who is <i>Devadatta</i>, come'. The <i>taddhita</i> affixes being optional [[4.1.82]], this idea may be expressed by a sentence also. As, को भवतो देवदत्तः, स आगच्छतु 'who amongst you two is <i>Devadatta</i>, let him come'.
