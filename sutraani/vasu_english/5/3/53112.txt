The <i>anuvritti</i> of इव ceases. The word पूग means a crowd of men of various castes, having no fixed livelihood, connected together with the object of acquiring wealth &c. Thus लौहध्वज्यः 'the trident bannered horde'. dual लौहध्वज्यौ, pl. लौहध्वजाः ॥ Similarly, शैब्यः, शैब्यौ, शिबयः, चातक्यः, चातक्यौ, चातकाः ॥ In the plural, the affix is elided by [[2.4.62]].

Why do we say अग्रामणीपूर्वात् ? Observe देवदत्तकाः [[5.2.78]] 'a horde whose leader is <i>Devadatta</i>'. From this <i>sutra</i> commence the तद्राज affixes &c, the affixes that have the sense of 'King thereof'. The affix ञ्य, therefore, has this meaning also viz. 'the leader of the horde'.
