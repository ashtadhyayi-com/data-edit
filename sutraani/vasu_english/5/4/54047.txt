The words अकर्त्तरि and तृतीयायाः are understood in this aphorism. Thus वृत्तेन हीयते or वृत्ततो हीयते ॥ चारित्रेण हीयते or चारित्रतो हीयते ॥ So also in construction with the word पाप, as, वृत्तेन पापः or वृत्ततः पापः ॥ चारित्रेण पापः or चारित्रतः पापः ॥ This use of the affix is in places other than those where censure is meant: in other words, it comes where no censure is implied but a simple fact is mentioned. Where censure is implied, the affix <i>tasi</i> would come by force of the preceding aphorism [[5.4.46]].

The word अकर्तरि being understood here also, the affix does not come when the 3rd case-affix has the force of an agent: as देवदत्तेन हीयते ॥
