The phrase "dependent upon that" is understood here also. The word देय qualifies the above phrase. When a thing which is known as a proper gift for the <i>Brahmanas</i>, is put under their control by offering it to them, then the affix <i>tra</i> is employed. Thus ब्राह्मणाधीनं देयं करोति = ब्राह्मणत्रा or ब्राह्मणसात् करोति "He gives it to the <i>Brahmanas</i>, as it is an object which ought to be given to them". ब्राह्मणत्रा भवति "it becomes given to the <i>Brahmans</i>". So also with यात् and संपद्यते ॥ Why do we say "when the sense is that of to be given"? Observe राजसाद् भवति राष्ट्रम् ॥
