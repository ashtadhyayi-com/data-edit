This is an <i>adhikara</i> or regulating <i>sutra</i>: and governs all <i>sutras</i> upto the end of this chapter. All the affixes to be ordained here after become the final part and integral portion of a compound, so that whenever a compound is formed, these affixes must be added to complete the compound. These affixes are useful in forming the <i>Avyayibhava</i>, the <i>Dvigu</i>, the <i>Dvandva</i>, the <i>Tatpurusha</i> and the <i>Bahu</i>-<i>vrihi</i> compounds: in fact so long as these affixes are not added, the compounds do not get the designation of <i>Avyayibhava</i> &c. Thus उप + राजन् = उपराजन् : now before this word can be properly called an <i>Avyayibhava</i>, we must elide the final अन् by adding the <i>samasanta</i> affix डच् [[5.4.108]], and we get the form उपराज, to which अम् is added by [[2.4.83]] and we have उपराजम्, so also अधिराजं ॥ So also द्विपुरी, त्रिपुरी the <i>samasanta</i> अ being added to पुर् by [[5.4.74]], then the feminine affix ङीप् by [[4.1.21]], the whole word द्विपुर being called <i>Dvigu</i>. So also, कटकवलयिनी and शङ्खनूपुरिणी ॥ Here the affix इनि [[5.2.128]] is added to the whole, <i>samasanta</i> word कटकवलय &c which gets the name of <i>Dvandva</i>. Similarly विधु꣡रः (विगतोधुरः), प्र꣡धुरः (प्रगतोधुरः). Here the whole <i>samasanta</i> [[5.4.74]] word gets the name of <i>Tatpurusha</i>, and hence the first member retains its accent by [[6.2.2]], namely <i>udatta</i>. (<i>phit</i> IV. 12 and 13) उचैर्धुरः, नीच꣡र्धुरः being <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, the first member retains its accent, namely acute on the final, as उचैः, नीचैः have been taught as <i>antodatta</i> in the very list of <i>Svaradi</i> (l. 1. 37).

As a general rule all affixes come at the end of a word [[2.1.2]], what is the use of employing the word "<i>anta</i>" in this <i>sutra</i>? It means that when words like <i>avyayibhava</i> &c are employed, they mean words having those affixes already at their end. Thus the <i>Dvigu</i> compound of द्वि॑ + धुर = द्विधुर् + अ [[5.4.74]] = द्विधुरः so that when rule [[4.1.21]] says that the feminine of <i>Dvigu</i> compounds ending in अ take ई, it refers to <i>Dvigu</i> compounds which have already taken the <i>samasanta</i> affix अ, otherwise the rule [[4.1.21]] would not have applied, for strictly speaking द्विधुर् ends in र् <i>r</i> and not in  अ ॥ Similarly rule [[5.2.128]] ordaining इनि after <i>Dvandva</i> compounds, means that the affix comes after a <i>Dvandva</i> compound that has already taken the <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् [[5.4.106]], as कोश + निषत् = कोश + निषद् + टच् [[5.4.106]] कोशनिषदं, कोशनिषदिनी ॥
