Later on will be mentioned certain words which when standing as member in a compound take these <i>samasanta</i> affixes. The present rule prohibits the application of those affixes when such words are preceded by a word expressing praise. Thus [[5.4.91]] ordains the affix टच् when the words राजन् enters a compound, as, महा + राजन् = महा + राजन् + टच् = महाराजः, and not महाराजा ॥ But सुराजा, अतिराजा, so also सुगौः, अतिगौः [[5.4.92]] prohibited)).

Vart:- The word expressing praise must be सु or अति and not any word expressing praise in general. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply in परमराजः and परमगवः ॥

Vart:- This prohibition applies up to <i>sutra</i> [[5.4.113]] exclusive. Thus सुसक्थः, अतिसक्थः, स्वक्षः, अत्यक्षः, here the affix पच् [[5.4.113]] is not prohibited.
