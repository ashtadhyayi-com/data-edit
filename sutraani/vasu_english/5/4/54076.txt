The word अच् is understood here. Thus लवणाक्षम्, पुष्कराक्षम् ॥ These are <i>Tatpurusha</i> metaphors formed by (II. I. 56).

Why do we say "when not meaning the eye"? Observe ब्राह्मणाक्षि ॥ How do you explain the forms कबराक्षः, गवाक्षः, which apparently contradict this rule, because कबराक्ष is a many-holed leather horse-veil through which the horses can see, and so also गवाक्ष is a window through which men see? This is no fault. The word दर्शन in the <i>sutra</i> does not mean 'to see', here, but is a synonym of 'eye'.
