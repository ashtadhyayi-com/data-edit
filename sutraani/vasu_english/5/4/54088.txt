When the affix टच् follows अहन्, and the latter is preceded by the words सर्व &c, then अह्न is substituted for अहन् ॥ By the term एतेभ्यः "these words", is meant the numerals (with the exception of एक [[5.4.90]]) the Indeclinables, the words सर्व, संख्यात and words denoting a part of a day, for these are the words mentioned in the last <i>sutra</i>. The word अहन् is also mentioned therein, but it is not taken here, for there can be no <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound of अहन् with अहन् ॥ The word पुण्य is also excluded by [[5.4.90]]. Thus द्वयोरह्नोर्भवः = द्व्यह्नः, त्र्यह्नः, अहरतिक्रान्तः = अत्यह्नः, निरह्नः ॥ So also सर्वाह्णः, [[8.4.7]], पूर्वाह्णः, अपराह्णः, संख्याताह्नः (according to some संख्याताहः [[5.4.90]]).

The ordaining of substitution is redundant according to the <i>Vartika</i> <i>kara</i>. In his opinion, the <i>sutra</i> अह्नः एतेभ्यः alone would have been enough. The meaning then would have been "the affix अच् comes after the word अहन् when preceded by these words सर्व &c". The adding of अच् would produce the same result: as द्वि + अहन् + अच् = द्वि + अह्न् + अच् [[6.4.134]] the middle अ of अहन् is elided)) = द्व्यह्नः ॥ The only specific result which टच् would have produced was to make the feminine of these words end in long ई [[4.1.15]], and the elision of the final अन् of अह्न [[6.4.145]]. But the compounds of अहन् are masculine always [[2.4.29]], they can have no feminine: and as the desired form is द्व्यह्नः, the <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.145]] cannot apply. The affix अच् is therefore, the proper affix and the substitution of अह्न for अहन् is redundant.
