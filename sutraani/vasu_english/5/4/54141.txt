The ऋ of दतृ is indicatory, making Rule [[7.1.70]] applicable, by which a nasal is added before त् in declining these words in <i>sarvanamasthana</i> cases: and rule [[4.1.6]] also applies to them. All rules relating to उगित् apply to these. Thus द्वौ दन्तावस्य = द्विदन् "a child of the age in which two teeth have appeared". So also त्रिदन्, चतुर्दन् ॥ शोभनादन्ता अस्य समस्ता जाताः = सुदन् कुमारः "a boy of the age in which all his teeth have appeared beautifully". Why do we say denoting 'age'? Observe द्विदन्तः कुंजरः ॥
