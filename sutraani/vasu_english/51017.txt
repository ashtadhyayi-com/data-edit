The affix ढञ् (+/- एय) comes after the word परिखा in the above senses of 'this is sufficient for that' and 'this is sufficient therein'.
This debars छ. Thus पारिखेयी भूमिः 'land sufficient to make a mote thereon'.

Up to this <i>Sutra</i> was the governing force of the affixes छ and यत् ॥ Hereafter another affix will be taught.
