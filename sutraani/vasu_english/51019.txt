Up to sutra [[5.1.63]], inclusive, the affix ठक् (+/- इक or +/- क)
<i>Karika</i>

ऊर्ध्वमानं किलोन्मानं परिमाणं तु सर्वतः ।
आयामस्तु प्रमाणं स्यात्संख्या बाह्या तु सर्वतः ॥

Strictly speaking ठक् governs upto <i>sutra</i> [[5.1.65]]. The word आर्हाद् is made up of आ + अर्हात् The force of आ here is अभिविधि or inclusive, so that in the <i>Sutra</i> तदर्हति [[5.1.63]] also, the ठक् will be employed. The affix ठक् debars ठञ् ॥ The sense will be the same as given in [[5.1.37]] &c. the difference between ठक् and ठञ् being in accent only. Thus निष्कया क्रीतं = नैष्किकम्, So also पाणिकम् ॥

But गोपुच्छेन क्रीतम् = गोपुच्छिकम्, the accent falling on गौ; so also with words denoting Numbers and Measures, as षाष्टिकम्, प्रास्थिकम्, कौडविकम् ॥

The word परिमाण in this <i>sutra</i> has its technical signification, and not its etymological sense. Technically परिमाण does not include संख्या, etymologically it does. <i>Panini</i> has used this word परिमाण  in some <i>sutras</i> in its technical sense, in others in its etymological sense. Thus in <i>sutras</i> [[4.1.22]], and [[5.1.19]] the technical sense is taken, while in <i>sutras</i> [[4.3.156]] and [[5.1.57]] the etymological sense is meant. Technically परिमाण means सर्वतो मानं or a measure of capacity, and surface namely length and breadth and height or depth, such as प्रस्थः &c, i.e. a cubic measure and a square measure. In this sense it is to be distinguished from the measures of length or lineal measure, technically called प्रमाण, such as a वितस्त्य 'a cubit' &c, on the one side, and the measures of weight, technically called उन्माण such as पल, &c on the other side. In short उन्मान means a measure of weight or gravity, परिमाण means a measure of volume or capacity, प्रमाण means a lineal measure, and a संख्या is beyond all these.
