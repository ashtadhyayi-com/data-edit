After the word पुत्र the affix छ (ईय) also comes, as well as यत् (य), in the above sense of 'a relation or a portent for the purpose of that'.
The word पुत्र being a dissyllabic word would always have taken यत् by the last aphorism. This ordains छ also. Thus पुत्रस्य निमित्तं संयोग उत्पातो वा = पुत्रीयम् or पुत्र्यम् ॥
