To the same bases सार्वभूमि and पृथ्वी , are added the same affixes अण् and अञ् respectively, in the sense of 'lord thereof'.
Thus सर्वभूमेरीश्वरः = सार्वभौमः 'the lord of the whole earth', पार्थिवः 'the lord of the earth'.

The word तस्य, showing the genitive construction of the base, has been repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was running into it from [[5.1.38]]; in order to show that the senses given in [[5.1.38]] do not extend further. Had तस्य not been repeated here, the word ईश्वरः would have been an attribute, like the words संयोग and उत्पात, of the word निमित्तः ॥
