The above mentioned affixes have also the sense of 'what is capable of holding that, or takes away that, or cooks that'.
The word तद् is understood here, showing that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the accusative. The word संभव means the capacity to hold the exact quantity; अवहार means 'taking away, or containing.' Thus प्रस्थं संभवति = प्रास्थिकः 'a vessel capable of holding a <i>Prastha</i> measure.' So प्रस्थमवहरति or पचति = प्रास्थिकः 'a vessel or a person that takes away, holds or cooks a <i>Prastha</i> measure.' Similarly क्रौडविकः and खारीकः ॥ The word संभव does not govern the word पचति, thus प्रस्थं पचति ब्राह्मणी = प्रास्थिकी <i>Brahmana</i> who cooks a <i>Prastha</i>'.

Vart:- The affix अण् also comes after the word द्रोण in the sense of 'who cooks that' e.g. द्रोणं पचति ब्राह्मणी = द्रौणी or द्रौणिकी ॥
