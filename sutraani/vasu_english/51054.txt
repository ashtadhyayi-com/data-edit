The affix ष्ठान् (-/- इक) as well as the affix affix ख (ईन) may optionally come after the same words आढक, आचित and पात्र being final of a द्विगु compound, the sense being that of 'what can hold etc.'.
The ख is read into the <i>sutra</i> by the word च of the aphorism. These two affixes ख and ष्ठन् being especially ordained, are not to be elided by [[5.1.28]]. But when in the alternative, we add the general affix ठञ्, then it is elided by [[5.1.28]]. The न् of ष्ठन् is for accent [[6.1.19]]. and the ष् for ङीष् ॥ Thus we have 3 forms:- द्व्याढकिकी, द्व्याढकीना, or द्व्याढकी; द्व्याचितिकी, द्व्याचितीना, द्व्याचिता. In this case of द्व्याचिता the feminine is not formed by ङीप् [[4.1.21]] because of the specific prohibition contained in [[4.1.22]]. So also द्विपात्रिकी, द्विपात्रीणा and द्विपात्री ॥
