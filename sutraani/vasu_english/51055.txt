After the word कुलिज , being final of a द्विगु , there is optionally the elision of the above affixes, or the adding of the affix ख (इन), in the sense of 'what can hold that etc.'.
By च the affix ष्ठन् is also added. The elision being optional, the affix ठञ् [[5.1.18]] may optionally be elided by [[5.1.28]]. Thus we get four forms: द्विकुलिजिकी (ष्ठन्), द्विकुलिजीना (ख), द्विकुलिजा (ठञ् लुक्), द्वैकुलिजिकी (ठञ्) ॥ In the last example, there is not <i>vriddhi</i> of the second term, though it was so required by [[7.3.17]]. The anomaly is explained by holding that the word कुलिज should be included in the exception along with संज्ञा and शाण of [[7.3.17]].
