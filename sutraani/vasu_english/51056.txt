The affixes taught in प्राग्वतेष्ठञ् [[5.1.18]] etc. have also the sense of 'this is his portion, price or pay'.
The सः shows that the case in construction is nominative. The word अंश means 'share,' वस्न means 'price,' भृति means 'wages.' Thus पंच अंशो वस्नो वा भृतिर्वास्य = पंचक 'whose portion, price or pay is five.' So सप्तकः, साहस्रः ॥
