The affix ठञ् comes in the sense of 'who goes' after the word योजन in the Accusative -2nd case construction.
Thus योजनं गच्छति = यौजनिकः ॥

Vart:- So also after the words क्रोशशत and योजनशत. As क्रौशशतिकः, यौजनशतिकः ॥

Vart:- The affix after these two words means also "who is worthy to be approached from so far". As क्रोशशतादभिगमनमर्हति = क्रौशशतिको भिक्षुः, यौजनशतिक आचार्यः ॥
