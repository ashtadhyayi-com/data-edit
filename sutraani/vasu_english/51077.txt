The affix ठञ् comes in the sense of 'who passes by that way' and 'what is conveyed by that way' after the word उत्तरपथ in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
The construction of the <i>sutra</i> shows that the base must be in the 3rd case. The word च shows that the word गच्छति 'who passes by that way' should also be read into the aphorism. Thus उत्तरपथेनाहृतं = औत्तरपथिकम् or उत्तरपथेन गच्छति = औत्तरपथिकः ॥

Vart :- So also after the word पथ preceded by the words वारि, जङ्गल, स्थल, कान्तार the affix has the sense of 'conveyed by that way' or 'passing by that way'. As वारिपथेनाहृतः = वारिपथिकम्, वारिपथेन गच्छति = वारिपथिकः, so also जाङ्गलपथिक, स्थालपथिक, कान्तारपथिक, masculine or neuter according as the affix means conveyed or passing.

Vart:- So also after the words अजपथ and शंकुपथ as, अजपथेनाहृतं गच्छति वा = आजपथिकः, शांकुपथिकः ॥

Vart:- The affix अण् comes after the word स्थलपथ when the thing conveyed or brought means 'honey' or 'pepper'. As स्थालपथं मधुकं, स्थालपथं मरिचम् ॥
