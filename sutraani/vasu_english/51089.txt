The affixes meaning 'accomplished' etc. पन्थो ण नित्यम् [[5.1.76]], तमधीष्टो भृतो भूतो भावी [[5.1.80]] are necessarily elided after the word वर्षा forming a द्विगु समास (Numeral Determinative Compound) when it refers to being endowed with reason.
Here the elision is compulsory and not optional as in the last. Thus द्विवर्षो दारकः 'a boy two years old'. Why do we say चित्तवति "when meaning endowed with reason" ? Observe द्विवर्षीणो व्याधिः ॥
