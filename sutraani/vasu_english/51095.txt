The affix ठञ् comes after a word being the name of sacrifice, in the sense of 'the fee thereof'.
As अग्निष्टोमस्य दक्षिणा = आग्निष्टोमिकी, वाजपेयिकी, राजसूयिकी ॥

The word आख्या in the <i>sutra</i> implies that the affix comes even after those sacrifice-denoting words which do not express time [[5.1.78]]; had it not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have applied only to such sacrifice-denoting words as एकाहः, द्वादशाह, which are time-denoting words as well. The <i>Vartika</i> in [[5.1.20]] would apply to द्वादशाह &c. Some texts do not read च in the <i>sutra</i>.
