The word ऐकागारिकट् is irregularly formed in the sense of 'thief'.
The feminine will be in ङीप्. Thus एकागारं प्रयोजनमस्य = ऐकागारिकः fem. °की ॥ This word can be regularly formed by ठञ्, but it will always be restricted to mean a thief. When any other thing is designated, it will not take this affix. Thus एकागारं प्रयोजनमस्य भिक्षाः, here there will be no affixing. The feminine moreover will be in ङीप् ॥ Some say the word is formed by adding the affix इकट् with the irregular <i>Vriddhi</i> of the first syllable.
