The word आकालिकट् is irregularly formed in the sense of 'what coincides with the beginning and the end i.e. what lasts only an instant'.
The word आकाल is substituted for समानकाल. Thus आकालिकः स्तनयित्नुः 'a thunder lasting for an instant'. आकालिकी विद्युत् "a lightening lasting a twinkle". i. e. whose death is equal to its time of birth or dying as soon as born.

Vart:- The affixes ठन् and ठञ् also come after आकाल; as आकालिका विद्युत् ॥

So far is the governing power of the affix ठञ् [[5.1.18]].
