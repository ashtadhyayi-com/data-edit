The affix वति (वत्) comes after a word in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction, in the sense of 'like that' when the meaning is 'similarity of action'.
As ब्राह्मणेन तुल्यं वर्तते = ब्राह्मणवत्, राजवत् ॥

Why do we say "action"? The affix will not be joined when the similarity is in 'quality'. As पुत्रेणसह स्थूलः "as big as the son", पुत्रेण तुल्यः पिङ्गलः ॥
