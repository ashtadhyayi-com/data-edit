The affix वुञ् comes in the sense of 'nature or action thereof' after a polysyllabic stem whose penultimate letter is य् and whose penultimate syllable is prosodially heavy.
The word उपोत्तमं means the last syllable but one in a word of three syllables or more. That word whose penultimate syllable is गुरू 'heavy', is called गुरूपोत्तमम् : the योपधा means 'having penultimate य्'.

Thus रामणीयकम् from रमणीय, वासनीयकं from वसनीय ॥

Why do we say "the penultimate letter being य्"? Observe विमानत्वं from विमान ॥

Why do say गुरूपत्तिम "the penultimate syllable being heavy"? Witness क्षत्रियत्वम् ॥

Vart:- Optionally so after the word सहाय, as, साहायकम् and साहाय्यम् ॥
The words उपोत्तम् and उपधा should be distinguished: the first means penultimate syllable (implying thereby the word is of more than two syllables), and the second means penultimate letter.
