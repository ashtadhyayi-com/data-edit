The affix ख (ईन) and खञ् comes in the sense of 'wholly made thereof' after the word सर्वचर्मन्।
The word सर्व is here a part of the sense of the affix, and joins with the word कृतः, and not with चर्मन्. The compounding is in fact made by the affix. Thus सर्वचर्मणकृतः = सर्वचर्मीणः or सार्वचर्मीणः "made wholly of leather."
