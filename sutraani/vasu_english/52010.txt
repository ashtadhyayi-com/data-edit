The affix ख (ईन) comes in the sense of 'who witnesses or experiences that' after the words 1. परोवर 2. परम्पर and 3. पुत्रपौत्र , in the Accusative -2nd case in construction.
The word परोवर is compounded of पर and अवर the ओ in रो being irregular, the compounding being caused by the affix. परांश्चावरांश्च अनुभवति = परोवरीणः "who lives to see high and low". The word परम्पर is compounded of पर and परतर the compounding being caused by the affix. As, परांश्च परतरांश्चानुभवति = परम्परीणः ॥ Similarly पुत्रपौत्रीणः ॥

The word परम्पर is a separate word as well, not formed by or admitting this affix. As मन्त्रिपरम्परा मन्त्रं भिनत्ति ॥
