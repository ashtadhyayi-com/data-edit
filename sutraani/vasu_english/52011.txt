The affix ख (ईन) comes in the sense of 'who purposes to go' after the words 1. अवारपार 2. अत्यन्त and 3. अनुकाम being in the Accusative -2nd case in construction.
The word गामी means 'गमिष्यति', see [[3.3.3]]. The genitive case is prohibited by [[2.3.70]]: the word गामी governing the accusative. Thus अवारपारं गामी = अवारपारीणः ॥

Vart:- So also when the words are reversed. As पारावारीणः ॥ So also when the words are taken separately as, अवारीणः and पारीणः ॥

So also अत्यन्तं गामी = अत्यन्तीनः = भृशं गन्ता ॥ As अनुकामीनः = यथेष्टं गन्ता ॥
