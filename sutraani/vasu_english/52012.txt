The affix ख (ईन) comes in the sense of 'who bears in the womb' after the word समांसमाम्।
The word विजायते means गर्भे धारयति 'who bears in the womb'. This verb governs the accusative of time समांसमां by [[2.1.29]]. Thus समांसमां विजायते = समांसमीना गौः, समांसमीना वडवा ॥

Vart:- According to others the aphorism means 'the affix comes in the sense of to give birth to or to get a young'. i.e. विजायते = गर्भमोचनं ॥ According to them, the verb governs the locative: समायां समायां विजायते = समांसमीना, the य् of the first समायां being elided, the rest of the <i>vibhakti</i> (आम्) remaining. The word will mean "an animal that gives birth to a young one every year".

Vart:- Sometime there is no affixing, but the whole sentence is to be used to express this meaning, or the य् only of both members is to be elided and a sentence formed. As समां समां विजायते or समयां समयां विजायते ॥
