The word अद्यश्वीन is anomalous meaning 'a female near delivery'.
The word विजायते is understood here. The word अवष्टब्ध means 'imminent, near'. It is formed by अव + स्तंभ + क्त, the स् being changed to ष् by [[8.3.68]]. Thus अद्य वा श्वो वा विजायते = अद्यश्वीना गौः "a cow likely to give birth to-day or to-morrow". So also अद्यश्वीना वडवा ॥

Some do not read विजायते into the <i>sutra</i>, which then means "The word <i>adyasvina</i> is irregularly formed meaning imminent". As अद्यश्वीनं मरणं 'imminent death'. अद्यश्वीनो वियोगः 'separation likely to take place to-day or tomorrow'.
