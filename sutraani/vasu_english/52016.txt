The affixes यत् (यं) and ख (ईन) come in the sense of 'who is fit or able to follow' after the word अध्वन्।
Thus अध्वानमलंगामी = अध्वनीनः or अध्वन्यः 'able to undertake a journey'. By aphorisms [[6.4.168]], [[6.4.169]], the word अध्वन् retains its original form before the affix य and ख, not losing its final अन् which it does before other affixes, by [[6.4.144]].
