The words शालीन and कौपीन are anomalous when meaning 'modest' and 'a shameful action, respectively.
The word अधृष्ट means 'not proud', अकार्यम् means 'unfit to be done' i. e. an infamous act. The words come from शाला "a hall" and कूप 'a well'. It is not easy to trace any connection between 'modesty' and 'a hall', or between 'shameful' and 'a well'. However some say शालाप्रवेशनमर्हति 'who deserves to enter a hall', = शालीनः, कूपावतारमर्हति 'who deserves to be thrown into a well' = कौपीनः, hence a thing to be concealed, and the dress that conceals it. As शालीनो जडः, कौपीनं पापं ॥
