The affix खञ् comes in the sense of 'who leads this life' or 'who lives by this' after the word व्रात being in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
The word व्रात means a multitude or mass composed of various castes, who have no fixed employment, and live by violence, or by bodily labor. व्रातेन जीवति = व्रातीनः 'a person who lives by the labour of his body, not of his brain'.
