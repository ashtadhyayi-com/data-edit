The affix ति comes in the sense of 'the root of it' after the word पक्ष in the Genitive 6th-Case in construction.
The word मूल of the last <i>sutra</i> is drawn into this aphorism; and not the word पाक as well. This is an exceptional case of अनुवृत्ति, generally the whole is drawn and not a portion. Hence arises the following maxim क्वचिदेकदेशोऽप्यनुवर्तते "Sometimes it also happens that only a part of the words of a rule which are mutually connected is valid in a subsequent rule, while the rest ceases to be valid".

Thus पक्षस्य मूलं = पक्षतिः i. e. प्रतिपत् 'the root or the first day of a <i>Paksha</i> or a fortnight'.
