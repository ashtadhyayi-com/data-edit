The affixes शालच् (शाल) and शङ्कटच् (शङ्कट) come after the preposition वि without changing the sense.
Thus विगते शृङ्गे = विशाले, विशंकटे ॥ Thus these words may apply to a cow, as विशालः, विशंकटः ॥ According to some these words are adjectives meaning 'great, large' &c. There is no connection here of sense of base and the affix.
