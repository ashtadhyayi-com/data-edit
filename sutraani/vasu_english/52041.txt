The affixes डति (अति with the elision of इम्) and वतुप् come in the sense of 'numerical quantity' after the word किम् in the Nominative 1st-Case in construction.
The च introduces the affix वतुप् which is changed into घतुप् (इयत्) ॥

The word संख्यापरिमाणे means संख्यायाः परिमाणं i.e. संख्यापरिच्छेदः 'making estimate by numbers'. As का संख्या परिमाणमेषां ब्राह्मणानां = कति ब्राह्मणाः or कियन्तो ब्राह्मणाः 'how many <i>Brahmanas</i> in number do you estimate these'. This always comes in the plural.

This word is formed, in fact, when a question is put relating to the numerical quantity (<i>sankhya</i>-<i>parimana</i>) of any thing. But the word <i>sankhya</i>-<i>parimana</i> may be explained also as a <i>Karmadharaya</i>, in which the attributive word has been placed second. It will then mean "quantitative number". The <i>sutra</i> will be rendered thus: "<i>kim</i> takes <i>dati</i>, when it means a quantitative number". It should not be objected that numbers are always quantitative, and therefore <i>parimana</i> is redundant in the aphorism. For sometimes numbers are used not to define any quantity but merely to mark contempt. As in the following:-

अव्रतानाममन्त्राणां जातिमात्रोपजीविनाम् । सहस्रशः समतानां पारषत्वं न विद्यते॥ Here the word सहस्रशः is used indefinitely in a contemptuous sense. Therefore, it is not true that a number always defines a quantity. Where किम् is used to express contemptuous number, no affixing takes place : as केयमेषां संख्या दशानाम् ॥ The word <i>parimana</i> in this <i>sutra</i> is not used in its technical sense; as in <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.39]] <i>ante</i>: for its very repetition here shows that it is used here to denote 'quantity' in general, and not 'capacity', for a number cannot mean 'capacity'.
