The affix तयप् comes in the sense of 'that whereof the parts are so many' after a numeral.
The word तदस्य is understood here. Thus पंच अवयवा अस्य = पंचतयम् 'having five parts'. The part being connected with the whole, the force of the affix is to denote the whole. So also दशतयम्, चतुष्टयम्, चतुष्टयी [[8.3.101]] and [[4.5.15]]
