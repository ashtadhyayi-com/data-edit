After the word उभ , अयच् is always the substitute for तयप् , having the उदात्त (acute accent) on its first syllable.
The affix अय꣡च् having indicatory च् takes the acute accent on the final syllable [[6.1.163]], i. e. on य, the special mention of the <i>udatta</i> in the  <i>sutra</i> shows that the accent should be on a syllable which would otherwise not have taken it i. e. the first syllable i. e. अ; for had this not been the meaning, there was no necessity of using the word <i>udatta</i> in the <i>sutra</i>.

If उभ is a <i>Sankhya</i> word (1.1. 23) in the secular sense, it would have taken तयप्, the present <i>sutra</i> ordains अय꣡ instead as a substitute always. If it is not a <i>Sankhya</i>, then we should first ordain तयप् after it, by the process of splitting the <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.42]] <i>ante</i> into two, thus संख्यायाः तयप्, अवयवे तयप् and then replace तयप् by अय꣡ ॥

Thus उभौ पीतलोहितौ अवयवौ यस्य = उभयः ॥ उभ꣡ये देवमनुष्याः; उभ꣡योः मणिः ॥
