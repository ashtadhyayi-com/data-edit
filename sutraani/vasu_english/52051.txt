When डट् follows, थुक् is the augment of the words 1. षट् 2. कति 3. कतिपय and 4. चतुर्।
The डट् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>, and it should be changed into locative, as डटि 'when <i>dat</i> follows'. The word कतिपय is not a Numeral, it takes डट् by force of this <i>sutra</i>. Thus षण्णां पूरणो = षष्ठः 'sixth'. कतिथः 'the which in order?' कतिपयथः 'the one in order after several', चतुर्थः 'the fourth'.

Vart:- The affixes छ (ईय) and यत् come after चतुर् and there is elision of the first letter. As तुरीयः or तुर्यः ॥

In this and the two following <i>sutras</i>, the action of the ड् of डट् vanishes when an augment is added.
