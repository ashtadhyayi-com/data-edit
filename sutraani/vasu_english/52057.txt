After the words शत etc. and after 1. मास 2. अर्धमास and 3. संवत्सर तमट् (तम feminine in ङीप्) is always the augment of डट्।
The words शतादय are numerals. The words मास &c, are not numerals; they would not have taken डट्, but by the implication of this <i>sutra</i>. Thus शतस्य पूरणः = शततमः 'hundreth'; सहस्रतमः, लक्षतमः ॥ Similarly मासस्य पूरणः = मासतमो दिवसः 'the last day of the month'. अर्द्धमासतमः, संवत्सरतमः ॥

By the next <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.58]], the words शत &c, would also have taken तमट्; but the scope of that <i>sutra</i> is confined to numerals not preceded by another numeral. There is no such restriction here. Hence we have एकशततमः, द्विशततमः ॥
