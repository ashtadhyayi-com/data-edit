The affix ठक् comes in the sense of 'voracious' after the word उदर।
The translation given above is according to Dr. Bohtlingk. According to the <i>Kasika</i>, the <i>anuvritti</i> of प्रसित is also read into this <i>sutra</i>. The meaning then would be <i>thak</i> comes after the word <i>udara</i> in the seventh case in construction, in the sense of 'who is devoted therein', when the word so formed means "voracious". A person who is very much distressed by hunger is so called; उदरेऽविजिगीषुर्भण्यते ॥ Thus उदरे प्रसितः = औदरिकः (i.e. आद्यूनः).

Why do we say when it means 'voracious'? Observe उदरकः 'abdominal'.
