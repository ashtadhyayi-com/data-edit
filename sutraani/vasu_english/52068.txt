The affix कन् comes in the sense of 'to supply richly with it' after the word सस्य being in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of कन्, not of ठक् is to be read here. The word सस्य here means 'good quality', and not 'corn'. Another reading is शस्य. The word परि means 'all, every where'. That which is full of (परिजात) good qualities (सस्य) in which there is no defect, that is the signification here. Thus सस्येन परिजातः = सस्यकः शालिः 'a rice, above all praise', सस्यकः साधुः 'a good man, not equalled by any'. सस्यको मणिः 'a precious stone of the best quality', i.e. 'perfect in form'.
