The affix कन् comes in the sense of 'who goes to work thus' after the words शीत and उष्ण।
The word शीत and उष्ण being used as adverbs will be in accusative construction. As शीतं करोति 'who goes to work coldly' i.e. a lazy man = शीतकः = अलसः, जडः. Similarly उष्णकः = शीघ्रकारी, दक्षः 'who goes to work hotly'.
