The affix कन् comes in the sense of 'who strives to gain something by that' after the word पार्श्व in the Instrumental -3rd case in construction.
The word पार्श्वम् means 'a fraudulent or crooked expedient'. One who endeavours to obtain any thing by fraud is called पार्श्वकः 'a cheat, a juggler, a partisan'. पार्श्व = a rib, a crooked thing; as पार्श्वकः = मायाविन्, कौसृतिकः, जालिकः &c.
