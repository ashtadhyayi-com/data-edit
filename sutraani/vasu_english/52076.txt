The affixes ठक् and ठञ् come in the sense of 'who strives to gain something by that 'after the words 1. अयःशूल and 2. दण्डाजिन , respectively
The word अन्विच्छति is understood here also. The word अयःशूलम् means 'a violent proceeding'. Who seeks to obtain any thing by violent means is called आयः शूलिकः = साहसिकः ॥ The word दण्डाजिन means 'staff (<i>danda</i>) and hide (<i>ajina</i>)' i.e. outer badges of devotion or hypocrisy. Who seeks to gain something by hypocrisy and deceit is called दाण्डाजिनिकः = दाम्भिकः ॥
