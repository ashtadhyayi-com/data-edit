The affix कन् comes in the sense of 'clog is its fetter' after the word शृङ्खल 'a clog' when the whole word means 'a young camel'.
Thus शृंखलं बन्धनमस्य करभस्य = शृंखलकः ॥  The young ones of camel are called करभ ॥ The wooden clogs put on their feet to prevent them from straying are called शृंखल ॥ Though the ropes &c are also used along with the clog, yet <i>srinkhala</i> being the principal object that takes away the freedom is called बन्धन or bond or fetter.
