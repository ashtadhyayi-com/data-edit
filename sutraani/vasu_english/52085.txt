The affixes इनि (इन्) and ठन् come in the sense of 'this is eaten by him' after the word ।
Thus श्राद्धं भुक्तमनेन = श्राद्धी or श्राद्धिकः "a person who has eaten obsequial food". This relates to a person who eats on the day the <i>Sraddha</i> ceremony takes place; and not at any other time nor who eats stale food of <i>sraddha</i>. अद्य भुक्ते श्राद्धे श्वः श्राद्धिक इति माभूत् ॥ The word श्राद्ध originally means a certain ceremony, and is derived from the word श्रद्धा with the affix ञ [[5.2.101]]. In a figurative sense, it here means the food taken at that ceremony.
