The affix इनि (इन्) comes in the sense of 'by whom something was done formerly' after the word पूर्व।
The word अनेन of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here. But what is the verb of which अनेन is the agent. The भुक्त does not come to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. Therefore we must supply some general verb such as 'doing' &c, to complete the sense. Thus पूर्वं गतमनेन = पूर्वी ॥ So also पूर्वं भुक्तं, पीतं &c. अनेन = पूर्वी s. पूर्विणौ d. पूर्विणः pl. In fact पूर्विन् means by whom some thing was done &c, formerly.
