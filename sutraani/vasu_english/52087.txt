The affix इनि (इन्) comes in the sense of 'by whom something is done' after the word पूर्व, also when another word precedes it.
Thus कृतपूर्वी कटम् = पूर्वं कृतमनेन 'who formerly made'. भुक्तपूर्वी ओदनम् ॥

In these words, first कृत and पूर्व are compounded by [[2.1.4]]; and then the affix is added. These two <i>sutras</i> [[5.2.86]], [[5.2.87]], give rise to these two maxims ग्रहनवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति "that which cannot possibly be anything but a <i>Pratipadika</i> or Nominal-stem, does, (contrary to (l. 1.72)) not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself." व्यपदेशिवद्भावोऽप्रातिपदिकेन "The rule of <i>vyapadesivad</i>-<i>bhava</i> does not apply to a <i>pratipadika</i>". That rule is embodied in the following <i>paribhasha</i>- व्यपदेशिवदेकस्मिन् -- "an operation which affects some thing on account of some special designation, which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach".
