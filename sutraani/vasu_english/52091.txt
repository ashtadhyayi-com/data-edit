The affix इनि comes in the sense of 'a spectator, looker on' after the word साक्षात् when the word so formed is a Name.
The word साक्षात् is an Indeclinable. The word संज्ञा is used in the aphorism to restrict the sense of the word. Thus साक्षाद् द्रष्टा = साक्षी, d. साक्षिणौ, pl. साक्षिणः 'an eye-witness'. In any transaction like loan, &c, three persons directly see the fact, and may be called द्रष्टा, viz. who gives, who takes, and another who merely looks on. By using the word संज्ञा, the word साक्षिन् is restricted to the mere looker on, and not to the lender or borrower.
