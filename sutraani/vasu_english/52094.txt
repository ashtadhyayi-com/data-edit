The affix मतुप् comes in the sense of 'whose it is' or 'in whom it is' after a word in the Nominative 1st-Case in construction.
Thus गावोऽस्य सन्ति = गोमत् nom. गोमान् 'having cows', as गोमान् देवदत्तः ॥ वृक्षा अस्मिन् सन्ति = वृक्षवत् (व being substituted for म by [[8.2.9]]), as वृक्षवान् पर्वतः ॥ Similarly यवमान्, प्लक्षमान् ॥ The word इति shows that the use of मतुप् and cognate affixes are restricted in their application. For example, a person who has three barley grains only will not be called यववान् ॥ This affix comes when the significations are (1) A large quantity or number, as गोमान् 'having many cows'. (2) When censure (निन्दा) is implied, as ककुदावर्त्ती, संखादकी (3) when praise (प्रशंसा) is meant, as रूपवती कन्या, (4) when an inherent or permanent quality of a thing is meant (नित्ययोग) as, क्षीरिणी वृक्षः ॥ (5) When excellence (अतिशायन) is meant, as, उदरिणी कन्या ॥ (6) When accompaniment (संसर्ग) is meant, as दण्डी, छत्री ॥ (7) When the sense of अस्ति 'to be' is denoted, as अस्तिमान् ॥

Vart:- The affix मतुप् is elided after words of quality (गुणवचन), as शुक्लो गुणोऽस्यास्ति = शुक्लः पटः ॥ कृष्णः, श्वेतः &c.
