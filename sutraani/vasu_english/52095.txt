The affix मतुप् comes in the sense of 'whose it is' or 'in whom it is' after the प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) रस etc.
As रसवान्, रूपवान्, गन्धवान् ॥ Why this special <i>sutra</i> with regard to रसादि words, when they would have taken मतुप् by the last <i>sutra</i>? This prevents the application to these words of other affixes having the sense of मतुप् ॥ How do you form then रूपिणी कन्या, रूपिको दारकः ॥ These are rare forms. According to <i>Patanjali</i> this <i>sutra</i> is useless. Or the word रस &c, must denote qualities, perceivable by the organs of taste, touch &c, i. e. रस should mean taste, रूप form. Therefore the forms रूपिणी and रूपिकः are valid, meaning शोभायोग्यता ॥ So also रसिको तटः = भावयोगः, here रूप and रस do not mean 'form' and 'taste'. And all words of quality having one syllable are governed by this <i>sutra</i>, and form their derivative in मतुप् ॥ See [[5.2.115]].
