The affix लच् comes optionally in the sense of मतुप् after a stem ending in long आ the word expressing something which is found only in a living being.
Thus from चूडा 'a crest', we have चूडालः or चूडावान्. So also कर्णिकालः or कर्णिकावान् ॥ Why do we say 'which is found in a living being'? Observe शिखावान् प्रदीपः 'the crested flame of a lamp'. Why do we say "ending in आ"? Observe हस्तवान्, पादवान् ॥

Vart:- It should be stated that the affix लच् comes only after what denotes member or limb of a living being, (and not anything like love, passion, intelligence &c, that are also found in living being). Hence there is no affixing of लच् here : चिकीर्षाऽस्यास्ति = चिकीर्षावान्, जिहीर्षावान् ॥

Every affix is <i>udatta</i> [[3.1.3]], unless contrary is indicated by some <i>anubandha</i>. The लच् would have been udatta by [[3.1.3]], even without the indicatory च् (V1.1. 163). The employment of this <i>anubandha</i>, however indicates that this <i>udatta</i> will never be changed into <i>svarita</i>, as other <i>udattas</i> are by rule [[8.2.6]], as चूडालोऽसि ॥
