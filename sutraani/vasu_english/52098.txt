The affix लच् comes in the senses of 'love' and 'strength' respectively after the words वत्स and अंस।
Thus वत्सलः 'loving the calf, loving, tender'. अंसलः 'strong, lusty'. The word वत्स means 'calf'; in वत्सल there is no trace of its origin, for it is applied to father, master &c, as वत्सलः स्वामी, वत्सलः पिता &c. The word अंस means 'shoulder': but अंसल means 'strong'. The affix लच् in these cases is not optional, but necessary and debars मतुप् ॥ In other senses, the <i>matup</i> only is added as अंसवती गौः, अंसवान् दुर्बलः ॥
