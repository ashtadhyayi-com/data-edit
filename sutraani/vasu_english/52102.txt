The affixes विनि and इनि come with the force of मतुप् after the words तपस् and सहर respectively.
The word तपस् ends in अस्, and therefore by [[5.2.121]], it would have taken विनि; similarly सहस्र ends in अ, and by [[5.2.115]], it would have taken इनि; it may, therefore, be objected, where is the necessity for the present <i>sutra</i>? To this it is replied, that by the next <i>sutra</i>, these words take the affix अण् also; so that, had there not been this present <i>sutra</i>, the अण् would have debarred the application of इनि and विनि of [[5.2.115]] and [[5.2.121]]. The affix ठन् [[5.1.115]] is also debarred after the word सहस्र, though it ends in अ ॥

Thus तपोऽस्यास्मिन् वा विद्यते = तपस्विन् nom. तपस्वी ॥ Similarly सहस्रिन् nom. सहस्रा ॥
