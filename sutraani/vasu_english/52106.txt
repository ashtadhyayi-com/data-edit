The affix उरच् comes in the sense of 'having projecting teeth' after the word दन्त।
Thus दन्ता उन्नता अस्य सन्ति = दन्तुरः ॥ The words in the <i>sutra</i> are either in the nominative or the locative case, but have the force of ablative.

Why do we say when the meaning is that of 'projecting'? Observe दन्तवान् 'having teeth'.
