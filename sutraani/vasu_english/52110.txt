The affix व comes in the sense of मतुप् after 1. गाण्डी and 2. अजग when the word is a Name.
As गाण्डीवं 'the bow <i>Gandiva</i> of <i>Arjuna</i>'  अजगवं 'the bow <i>Ajagava</i> of <i>Siva</i>'. There is shortening also, as गाण्डिवं ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is so framed, that the word गाण्डी and गाण्डि are both included.
