The affix ठञ् always comes in the sense of मतुप् after a stem which in composition is preceded by एक or गो।
Thus एकशतमस्यास्ति = ऐकशतिकः; गौशतिकः, गौसहस्रिकः ॥

The word अतः of [[5.2.115]], is understood here also; so that, stems not ending in अ are not governed by this rule, such as एकविंशतिरस्यास्ति, no affixing. The word ऐकगविकः is an apparent exception, it being formed by adding ठञ् to the <i>samasanta</i> word एकगव [[5.4.92]]. How do you explain गौशकटिकः formed by ठञ् from गोशकटी ? Here शकटं is taken for शकटी, both being synonyms (N. B. This opinion of the <i>Kasika</i>-author is not in harmony with that of <i>Patanjali</i>, who does not read the <i>anuvritti</i> of अतः into this <i>sutra</i>. According to him गौशकटिक is formed from गोशकटी; and एकविंशति &c, do not take this affix, because it is against usage. But the author of <i>Kasika</i> says—अवश्यं चात इत्यनुवर्त्यम्; द्वन्द्वापतोपगर्ह्यात् इत्येवमाद्यर्थम् -- the <i>anuvritti</i> of अतः must surely be read, for the sake of <i>sutras</i> like [[5.2.128]], though in the <i>sutras</i>, like वातातिसाराभ्यां &c there is no necessity of reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of अतः) ॥

The word नित्यम् 'always', is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that मतुप् does not come in the alternative. In all the previous <i>sutras</i> मतुप् came in the alternative. How do you form एकद्रव्यवत् in एकद्रव्यवत्वाद् ? This is not a correct form; or it may be said to be a compound of एक and द्रव्यवत्वात् ॥
