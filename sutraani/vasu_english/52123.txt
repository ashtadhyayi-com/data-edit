The affix युस् is added to ऊर्णा in the sense of मतुप् in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
The स् of युस् makes the word ऊर्णा a पद [[1.4.16]]; the result of which is that rules applicable to भ <i>Bha</i> do not apply; e. g. [[6.1.148]], by which the final इ or ई, अ or आ is elided. Thus ऊर्णायुः ॥ According to some; छन्दसि is to be read in this <i>sutra</i>. The author of <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i> says that this is reasonable; for if <i>yus</i> is added to <i>urna</i> in secular literature also, then there was no necessity of this <i>sutra</i>. The word <i>urna</i> could have been read along with <i>aham</i> and <i>subham</i> in [[5.2.140]].
