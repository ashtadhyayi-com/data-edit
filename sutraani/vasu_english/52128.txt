The affix इनि (इन्) comes in the sense of मतुप् after a द्वन्द compound after the name of a disease and after anything denoting fault when the thing is found in a living being.
Thus <i>Dvandva</i>:-- कटकवलयिनी 'a woman having a bracelet and a zone', शङ्खनूपुरिणी 'a woman having <i>sankha</i> and <i>nupur</i> ornaments'. So after diseases: कुष्ठी 'a leper', किलासी 'a white leper'. So after names of faults:- ककुदावर्ती, काकतालुकी ॥

Why do we say 'when found in a living being ?' Observe पुष्पफलवान् वृक्षः ॥ The affix, according to a <i>Vartika</i>, does not come after words denoting members of a living body: as, पाणिपादवती ॥ The word अतः [[5.2.115]], is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so that the affix does not come after words not ending in अ; as चित्रकललाटिकावती ॥ Though <i>Dvandva</i> compounds &c. ending in अ, would have taken इनि by [[5.2.115]], the repetition of this affix in the present <i>sutra</i> shows that <i>Dvandva</i> compounds &c, take only इनि, and not ठन् &c.
