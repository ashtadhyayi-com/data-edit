The augment कुक् comes before इनि (इन्) after the words 1. वात and 2. अतिसार।
The words वात and अतिसार being names of diseases, will take इनि by the fore-going <i>sutra</i>; the present aphorism only teaches the affixing of the augment. Thus वातकी, अतिसारकी ॥ Another reading is अतीसारकी ॥

Vart:- So also after पिशाच, as पिशाचकी वैश्रवणः 'the <i>Kubera</i>'.

This is when the words वात and अतिसार denote diseases. Otherwise, वातवती गुहा ॥
