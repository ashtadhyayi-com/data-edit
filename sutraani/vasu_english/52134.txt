The affix इनि (इन्) comes in the sense of मतुप् after the word वर्ण when the word so formed means a ब्रह्मचारिण्।
Thus वर्णिन् 'a <i>Brahmachari</i>'. The first three वर्ण or castes, who are entitled to the investiture with sacred thread, and lead the life of a <i>Brahma</i> student are so called. When the meaning is not of <i>Brahmachari</i> we have वर्णवान् ॥
