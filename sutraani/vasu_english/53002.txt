These प्राग्दिशीय affixes come after the word किम् and after a stem called सर्वनाम and after बहु but not after द्वि etc.
The words द्वि &c, though सर्वनाम are exempted. Thus कुत्र, कृतः, यतः, यत्र, बहुतः, बहुत्रः ॥

Why do we say अद्व्यादि 'not <i>dvi</i> &c'. Observe द्वाभ्याम्, द्वयोः ॥ Why do we say किम् &c ? Observe वृक्षात्, वृक्षं &c. The word किम् is a सर्वनाम, but it being included in the <i>dyadi</i> class, would have been exempted from the operation of this rule had it not been separately mentioned.

Vart:- The word बहु here is a <i>Sankhya</i>. Therefore, the affix does not apply here, बहोः सूपात्, बहौ सूपे ॥
