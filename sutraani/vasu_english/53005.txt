The substitute अश् comes in the place of एतद् when a प्राग्दिशीय affix follows.
The श् of अश् causes the replacement of the whole [[1.1.55]]. According to <i>Patanjali</i> the substitute is अन् and not अश् ॥ Thus एतद् + तसिल् = अतः [[5.3.7]]; अत्र [[5.3.10]].

Vart:- This <i>sutra</i> must be divided into two एतदः, and अश्, the meaning being. (1) The substitutes एत and इत् come in the place of एतद् when affixes beginning with र् and थ respectively follow, as एतद् + र्हिल = एतर्हि [[5.3.21]] एतद् + थमु = इत्थम् ॥ The थ must be the थ of थमु which comes after <i>idam</i> [[5.4.24]] for the application of this rule (1), and not the थ of थाल् [[5.3.23]] before which the substitute will be अश् ॥ The word एतद् will take थमु by the implication af this rule. (2) The substitute अश् replaces एतद् before other <i>Pragdisiya</i> affixes.
