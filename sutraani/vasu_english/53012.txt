The affix अत् (अ) comes after किम् ending in the Locative -7th case.
This debars त्रल् ॥ Thus किम् + अत् = क्व + अ [[7.2.105]] = क॑ as क्व भोक्ष्यसे 'where will you eat'. क्वाध्येष्यसे । According to some त्रल् also comes, as कुत्र ॥ This is done by drawing the word वा 'optionally' from the next <i>sutra</i>. So that this <i>sutra</i> becomes an optional one.
