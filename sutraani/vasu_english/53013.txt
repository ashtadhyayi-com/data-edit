Optionally the affix ह also comes in the छन्दस् (Vedas) after the word किम् in the Locative -7th case as well as other affixes.
Thus कुह [[7.2.104]], क, कुत्र. As in <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VIII.62.4: कुह॑स्थः॒ कुह॑जग्मथुः कुह॑ श्ये॒नेव॑ पेतथुः ॥ 'Where are ye two? Where are you (or did you) going? Where do you fall like eagles?'.
