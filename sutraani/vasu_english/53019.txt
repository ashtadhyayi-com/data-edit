After तद् ending in the Locative -7th case when time is denoted, comes the affixes दा and दानीम् 
The दानीम् is read into the <i>sutra</i> by force of the word च 'also'. Thus तस्मिन् काले = तदा or तदानीम् 'at that time'. This <i>sutra</i>, so far as it ordains दा after the word तद् is useless, because the word तद् already takes दा by [[5.3.15]].
