The word पश्चात् is anomalous in the sense of अस्ताति।
The word is formed by changing अपर into पश्च, and adding the affix आति ॥ As अपरस्यां दिशि वसति = पश्चाद्वसति, आगतः, रमणीयम् &c.

Vart:- So also when अपर is preceded by another word denoting direction, it is changed into <i>pascha</i> and <i>ati</i> is added. As दक्षिणपश्चात् उत्तरपश्चात् ॥

Vart:- So also when अर्ध follows such a compound, <i>apara</i> is changed into <i>pascha</i>; as, दक्षिणपश्चार्धः, उत्तरपश्चार्धः ॥

Vart:- <i>Apara</i> is changed into <i>pascha</i>, when followed by <i>ardha</i>, and not preceded by any other word. As, पश्चार्धः ॥
