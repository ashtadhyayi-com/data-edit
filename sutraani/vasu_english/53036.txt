The affix आच् (आ) comes after the word दक्षिण in the sense of अस्ताति , but not as a substitute of the Ablative -5th case.
The word अदूर of the last <i>sutra</i> is not read into this: though the word अपञ्चम्याः governs it. Thus दक्षिणा वसति or रमणीयम्, but दक्षिणत आगतः ॥ The च् in आच् is not for the sake of accent [[6.1.163]] for the simple affix आ would be <i>udatta</i> by the general rule [[3.1.3]]. The च् serves the purpose of differentiating this आ from other affixes in <i>Sutra</i> [[2.3.29]].
