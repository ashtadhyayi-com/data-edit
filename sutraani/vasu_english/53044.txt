After the word एक the substitute comes optionally instead of धा।
Thus एकधा राशिं कुरु or ऐकध्यं कुरु, एकधा भुङ्क्ते or ऐकध्यं भुङ्क्ते ॥ The repetition of धा in the <i>sutra</i> shows that the substitution takes place when the sense is that of विधा, as well as when it is that of अधिकरण विचाल ॥ Had धा not been repeated, the substitution would have come in the sense of अधिकरण विचाल only, as immediately preceding this <i>sutra</i>.
