The affix पाशप् denotes something as insignificant.
The word याप्य means 'contempt, trifling' &c. Thus वैयाकरणः = वैयाकरणपाशः 'a very bad Grammarian'. So also याज्ञिकपाशः ॥ Of course this will not come in denoting a person who is a good Grammarian, but bears bad character, or who is a good performer of sacrifices but immoral.
