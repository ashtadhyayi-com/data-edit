The affix चर (with the feminine in ङीप्) comes after a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem), the word retaining its detonation when the meaning is 'this had been before'.
The word भूतपूर्व is a compound of पूर्व and भूतः the compounding being by सुप्सुपा, and denotes something done in a past time. Thus आढ्यो भतपूर्वः = आढ्यचरः 'once opulent'. सुकुमारचरः ॥ The ट् indicates that the feminine will be in ङीप्; as, आढ्यचरी ॥ The च् is not इत् in चरट् though required by (1.3. 7). This proves that चुटु rule is <i>anitya</i>. The <i>sutra</i> [[5.2.18]] might have been read after this, with the saving of the word भूतपूर्वः, but then खञ् would have debarred चरट् which is, however, not intended.
