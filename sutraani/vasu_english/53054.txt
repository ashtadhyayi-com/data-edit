After a प्रातिपदिक (Nominal Stem) ending in the Genitive 6th-Case comes the affix रूप्य and also चरट् in the sense of 'having belonged formerly to somebody'.
The word भूतपूर्व here qualifies the sense of the affix, and not the sense of the base, as it in the last <i>sutra</i>. Thus देवदत्तस्य भूतपूर्वो गौः = देवदत्तरूप्यः 'the cow that formerly belonged to <i>Devadatta</i>'. Similarly देवदत्तचरः ॥
