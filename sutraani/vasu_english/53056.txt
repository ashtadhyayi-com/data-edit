So also after a finite verb, comes the affix तमप् (तम) when 'surpassing' is meant
By ङ्याप्प्रातिपदिकात् (IV. I.I) whose force runs throughout, the <i>taddhita</i> affixes are ordained only after nominal stems; they would not have come after verbs, hence this <i>sutra</i>. Thus पचतितमाम् (the आम् is added by [[5.4.11]] = सर्व इमे पचन्तीति, अयमेषामतिशयेन पचति, 'he cooks surprisingly'. जल्पतितमाम् &c. The affix इष्ठन् never comes after a verb, as by [[5.3.58]], it is restricted to adjectives.
