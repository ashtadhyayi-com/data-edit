The two affixes beginning with a vowel i.e. ईयस् and इष्ठ are added only after words denoting attributes.
The affixes इष्ठन् and ईयसुन् are restricted in their scope by this <i>sutra</i> i. e. they come only after adjectives or adverbs, in expressing comparative and superlative degrees. Thus लघीयान् , लघिष्टः, पटीयान्, पटिष्टः; but not after words like पाचक &c. There we have पाचकतरः, पाचकतमः ॥ The word एव 'only' restricts the scope of the affixes, and not of the primitives. Thus पटुतरः, पटुतमः are also valid forms.
