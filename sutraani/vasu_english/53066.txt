The affix रूपप् comes without a change of connotation after a stem - nominal or verbal, denoting 'praise'.
The word प्रशंसा means 'praise', and it qualifies the sense of the primitive; i. e. when the sense of the primitive is that of 'praise', then रूपप् is added. As a general rule the स्वार्थिक affixes, which do not change the denotation of the word, serve the purpose of prominently bringing forward one particular meaning out of the several meanings possessed by a primitive. Thus प्रशस्तो वैयाकरणः = वैयाकरणरूपः 'a celebrated Grammarian'. So also याज्ञिकरूपः ॥ The praise may be implied by the sense of the primitive, without being absolute praise: thus चोररूपः 'a celebrated thief', दस्युरूपः 'a celebrated robber'; a person very expert in his evil courses even; these word being applied to a thief who is so dexterous that he can steal 'the collyrium from the eye-lashes', or 'a horse from under the rider', without the latter being aware of it.

The affix comes after a verbal word ending in तिङ्, for the word तिङश्च [[5.3.56]] is understood here also. Thus पचतिरूपम्, पचतोरूपम् or पचन्तिरूपम् 'who is celebrated, who two are celebrated or who all are celebrated in cooking'. These words पचतिरूपम् &c cannot take dual or plural; because the action denoted by the verb is only one, not many. These words are always in the neuter gender, by the general usage of the people.
