The affixes कल्पप् (कल्प), देश्य and देशीयर् (देशीय) come after a nominal or verbal stem which connotes a slight incompleteness.
The word समाप्ति means 'fullness of objects'. A little non-fullness is called ईषदसमाप्ति ॥ Thus पटुकल्पः, पटुदेश्यः or पटुदेशीयः 'clever but slightly incomplete' i. e. 'tolerably clever'. मृदुकल्पः, मृदुदेश्यः, मृदुदेशीयः ॥ So also after verbs, as पचतिकल्पम्, जल्पतिकल्पम् ॥ &c.
