Optionally to a declined noun may be added the affix बहुच् (बहु) but it stands before, when the sense is slight incompleteness.
This is the only exception to the general rule that an affix is added after a word. The affix बहुच् however is added before the word. The च् of बहुच् indicates that the <i>udatta</i> will fall on the final vowel of the word. See [[6.1.163]]. Thus बहुपटुः꣡ 'a tolerably skillful person'. बहुमृदुः꣡, बहुगुडा꣡ दाक्षाः ॥ By the word 'optionally' it is indicated that the affixes कल्प &c also come. By using the word सुपः 'to a noun ending in a case-affix i. e a declined noun', it is indicated that the affix is not added to finite verbs (तिङन्त) ॥
