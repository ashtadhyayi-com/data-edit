The affix क governs all sūtras as far as इवे प्रतिकृतौ [[5.3.96]].
Properly speaking क extends only upto [[5.3.86]]. Thus in the <i>sutra</i> अज्ञाते [[5.3.73]], the word क must be supplied to complete the sense. As अश्वकः, गर्दभकः ॥ This affix क does not come after finite verbs (तिङन्त), but the affix अकच् [[5.3.71]] comes after such verbs. In other words, the phrase तिङश्च [[5.3.56]], should be connected, by way of <i>anuvritti</i>, with the next <i>sutra</i>, and not with this.
