Also as an expression of courteousness, the above mentioned affix is added to that by which compassion is shown.
The word नीति means 'policy' or 'expedient', such as 'conciliation', 'dissension' and 'punishment'. तद्युक्तात् means 'joined with that, i.e. with gift compassion'. In other words, the things signified by the bases, are connected as means of relief with the persons or things that have been objects of compassion. Thus, हन्त ते धानकाः 'alas! here are barley for you'. हन्त ते तिलकाः 'alas! here are sesamun for you'. एहकि, अद्धकि 'O dear! come and eat'. (These words are supposed to be addressed to a person who is starving, by one who wants to relieve him. <i>Iyengar</i>). Being moved with compassion, he entreats coursteously the object of sympathy, with gifts to relieve his want. In the last <i>Sutra</i>, the affix was added, in the sense of compassion, to the name of the person or action that evoked pity. In the present <i>sutra</i>, the affix is added to the object or action by which pity is shown. The word एहकि is from एहि the Imperative second person Singular of इ 'to go' with the <i>upasarga</i> आ ॥
