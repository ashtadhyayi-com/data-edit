Also the affixes घन् and इलच् come after a word of more than two syllables being the name of a human being when compassion or courtesy joined with compassion is expressed.
The force of च is that the other affix कन् also comes, as well as ठच् ॥ Thus from देवदत्त we have: देवियः, देविलः, देविकः, देवदत्तकः ॥ So from यज्ञदत्तः—यज्ञिकः, यज्ञिलः यज्ञिकः, यज्ञदत्तकः ॥ [[5.3.83]].
