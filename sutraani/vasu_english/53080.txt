According to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians the affixes अडच् and वुच् also come after a human name beginning with the word उप।
The च shows that the former affixes also come. The sense of the affixes are the same as above viz. compassion or courtesy. Thus from the word उपेन्द्रदत्त, we have, 1. उपेन्द्रदत्तकः (<i>kan</i>), उपिकः (<i>thach</i>), 3, उपिलः (<i>ilach</i>), 4. उपियः (<i>ghan</i>), 5. उपकः (<i>vuch</i>), 6. उपडः (<i>adach</i>). The shortened forms are by [[5.3.83]]. In diminutives, the forms are generally shortened. The word प्राचां is used as a sign of respect (<i>pujartha</i>), for the word वा was understood in the aphorism by <i>anuvritti</i> from [[5.3.78]].
