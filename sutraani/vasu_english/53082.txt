The affix कन् comes in the sense of compassion, after a man-name ending in अजिन and this second member is elided before the affix.
The words कन् and मनुष्यनाम्नः are understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus व्याघ्रकः from व्याघ्राजिनः, and सिंहकः from सिंहाजिनः ॥ <i>Vyaghrajina</i> and <i>Sinhajina</i> are names of men.
