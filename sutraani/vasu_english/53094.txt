After the word एक , according to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians, may be added the affixes डतरच् and डतमच् in the above senses.
The च draws in डतरच् ॥ That is डतरच् comes when one out of two is to be specified; and डतमच् when one out of many is to be specified. The word जातिपरिप्रश्ने does not govern this <i>sutra</i>: it being a general rule. Thus एकतरो भवतोर्देवदत्तः, एकतमो भवतां देवदत्तः ॥

The word प्राचाम् is for <i>pujartha</i>; the word वा being already understood in the <i>sutra</i>.
