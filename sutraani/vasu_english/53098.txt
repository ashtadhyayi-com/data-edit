When in the same way a Man is denoted the affix is elided by लुप् , the word retaining its number and gender.
Thus चञ्चा (चञ्चेवमनुष्यः) 'straw-man' i.e. an effigy in stray. So also दासी, खरकुटी ॥ For accent see [[6.1.204]].

Why do we say 'a man'? Observe अश्वकः, उष्ट्रकः &c. This <i>sutra</i> may be considered to be an enlargement of [[5.3.100]].
