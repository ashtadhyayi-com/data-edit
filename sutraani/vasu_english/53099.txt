A similar elision of the affix कन् takes place then also, when the figure is made a means of livelihood, it being presumed, that no traffic is driven thereby.
That which is bought and sold is called पण्य; that which is not so dealt with is अपण्यः ॥ The rule applies to the images of gods which are made means of subsistence by a low order of <i>Brahmanas</i>, not by selling them, but by exhibiting them from door to door. Thus वासुदेवः 'the idol of <i>Vasudeva</i>': शिव 'the idol of <i>Siva</i>'. स्कन्दः, विष्णुः, आदित्यः &c.

Why do we say अपण्ये ? Observe, हस्तिकान् विक्रीणीते 'he sells the images of elephant'. अश्वकान्, रथकान् ॥

This rule is also an amplification of [[5.3.100]].
