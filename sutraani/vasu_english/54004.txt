After a participle ending in क्त comes the affix कन् when the meaning is something not yet wholly completed.
The word अत्यन्तगति means an act which has been fully accomplished; अनत्यन्तगति therefore, means, an act which has not been fully accomplished. Thus भिन्न + कन् = भिन्नकः "not yet wholly divided" So also छिन्नकः &c.

Why do we say "something not wholly completed"? Observe भिन्नम् "totally divided", छिन्नम् 'totally cut'.
