The affix कन् comes after the word बृहति when it means 'an article of dress'.
The word कन् is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> and not its prohibition. The force of this कन् is nil, or it is an example of स्वार्थे कन् ॥ Thus बृहती + कन् = बृहतिका (प्रावारः) [[7.4.13]] (by which long vowel is shortened) "an upper garment or mantle".

Why do we say "when it means dress"? Observe बृहती छन्दः "the metre called <i>Brihati</i>".
