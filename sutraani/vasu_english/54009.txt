The affix छ (ईय) is added without a change of sense to a stem ending in the word जाति when it means appropriateness.
The word बन्धु means the substance or substratum in which <i>jati</i> or generic quality adheres or any thing by which a thing is regulated and individualised (बध्यते नियम्यते स्वतन्त्री क्रियते). Thus बन्धु means that substance by which the genus <i>Brahmana</i>, <i>Kshatriya</i> &c is distinguished. Thus ब्राह्मणजातीयः "appropriate to a <i>Brahmana</i>". क्षत्रियजातीयः, वैश्यजातीयः &c.

Why do we say "when meaning appropriateness". Observe ब्राह्मणजातिः शोभना "the <i>Brahmana</i> caste is beautiful".
