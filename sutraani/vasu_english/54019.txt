The word सकृत् is substituted for एक before the affix सुच् (स्) when an action is to be counted.
This debars कृत्वसुच् ॥ The 'repetition' being impossible, the action alone is counted : so the <i>anuvritti</i> of क्रिया only runs into this <i>sutra</i> and not of अभ्यावृत्तिः ॥ Thus सकृद्भुङ्क्ते "he eats once" सकृदधीते ॥ The स् of सुच् is elided by [[8.2.23]]. But not here in एकः पाकः as being against usage.
