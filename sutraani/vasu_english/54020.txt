The affix धा is optionally added to the numeral बहु to count the repetition of an action occurring in a not distant period of time.
This debars कृत्वसुच् which comes in the alternative. The word अविप्रकृष्ट "not remote", qualifies क्रियाभ्यावृत्तिः; i. e. when the recurring of the action takes place within a short time, it is अविप्रकृष्टकाल ॥ Thus बहुधा or बहुकृत्व दिवसस्य भुङ्क्ते "he eats many times a day". But when a remote time is denoted then धा does not apply. Thus बहुकृत्वो मासस्य भुङ्क्ते 'he eats many times in a month, not daily, owing to poverty &c.'
