The affix मयट् (मय with the feminine in grave ई) is added to a word in Nominative 1st-Case in construction when the sense is 'made thereof' or 'subsisting therein'.
The translation of the <i>sutra</i> given above is according to the rendering of Prof. Bohtlingk. According to <i>Kasika</i>: तत् signifies that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the nominative case, [[4.1.82]] the word प्रकृतम् means "happening to be in abundance". So that according to this interpretation the <i>sutra</i> should be translated, as done by Dr. Ballantyne, "The affix <i>mayat</i> may be employed after a word denoting some substance, when we require an expression for it as abundant". Thus अन्नं प्रकृतम् = अन्नमयम्  "abundance of food", अपूपमयम् "abundance of cake". According to others, that in which there is abundance of the thing signified by the word to which the affix मयट् is added, is denoted by the whole word. Thus अन्नं प्रकृतमस्मिन् = अन्नमयो यज्ञः "a feast in which there is abundance of food". अपूपमयं पर्व, वटकमयोयात्रा ॥ Both senses are possible, as the <i>sutra</i> is constructed.

"The word वचन in the <i>sutra</i> has two senses. It being made by the affix ल्युट् conveys the force both of the nature [[3.3.114]] and the site. In the former case, (taking, तत् प्रकृतवचन to mean "the mention of that as abundant)", we have अन्नमयम् "abundance of grain". But in the second case, (taking it to mean "that in which something is spoken of as abundant)" we have अन्नमयो यज्ञः "sacrifice at which food is abundant". (Dr. Ballantyne's <i>Laghukaumudi</i>).
