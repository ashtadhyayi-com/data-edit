The affix तल् comes after देव without change of sense.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of तादर्थ्य does not apply here and ceases. Thus देवता = देवः ॥ This word is always in the feminine, another example of the rule that a word derived by a <i>svarthika</i> affix does not always follow the gender of its primitive.
