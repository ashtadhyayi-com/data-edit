After a word signifying much or little, comes the affix शस् optionally when the word stands in agreement with a verb (as कारक)।
No especial कारक being mentioned, all cases such as accusative &c are to be taken. Thus बहूनि ददाति = बहुशो ददाति, बहुभिर्ददाति = बहुशो ददाति ॥  So also बहुभ्यः आगच्छति or बहुश आगच्छति &c. Similarly अल्पशो ददाति = अल्पं or अल्पेन &c.

Why do we say "signifying much or little"? Observe गां ददाति, अश्वं ददाति ॥

Why do we say "when it is a karaka"? Observe बहूनां स्वामी "lord of many". Here the words are in genitive case and a genitive or 6th case is not a कारक or a case, dependent or related to a verb: and so the affx is not applied here.

By the word 'signifying', the synonyms of बहु and अल्प are also included. Thus भूरिशो ददाति, स्तोकशो ददाति ॥

This affix is to be applied only when the action refers to an auspicious act. Thus बहुशो ददाति = अभ्युदयिकेषु कर्मसु; अल्पशो ददाति = अनिष्टेषु कर्मसु ॥ Thus बहुशो देहि "Give much on auspicious occasions as sacrifices &c". अल्पशो देहि "give a little on unauspicious, occasions as funeral feasts &c".
