The affix शस् comes optionally after crude forms denoting numbers and words denoting units of a coin in the singular number when a distributive sense is to be expressed (and the word is a कारक).
Thus द्वौ द्वौ मोदकौ ददाति = द्विशो मोदकौ ददाति "He gives two sweet-meats to each". So also त्रिशः ॥ Similarly after words in the singular number as, कार्षापणशो ददाति "he gives a <i>Karshapana</i> coin to each". So also माषशः, पादशः ॥ That by which the sense of unit is expressed is called <i>eka</i>-<i>vachana</i>. The words <i>karshapana</i> &c denote quantity, but their function in the sentence is to denote one-ness i. e. one to each, though in fact many are given.

Why de we say "after Numerals and units of coin"? Observe घटं घटं ददाति "he gives a pot to each". Why do we say "when a distributive sense is meant"? Observe द्वौ ददाति "He gives two". कार्षापणम् ददाति "he gives a <i>karshapana</i>".

This rule of course applies when the word is in relation with a verb viz. when it is a <i>karaka</i>, and not when it is in the genitive case governing another noun. As द्वयोर्द्वयोः स्वामी "Lord of two each". कार्षापणस्य कार्षापाणस्य स्वामी "Possessor of a <i>karshapanas</i> each". In fact the work "<i>karakat</i>" of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. This <i>sutra</i> is exception to [[8.1.4]].
