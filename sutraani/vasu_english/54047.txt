And The affix तसि comes optionally after a word ending in the Instrumental -3rd case-affix when such a word is joined to the verb हीय or the noun पाप not denoting an agent.
The words अकर्त्तरि and तृतीयायाः are understood in this aphorism. Thus वृत्तेन हीयते or वृत्ततो हीयते ॥ चारित्रेण हीयते or चारित्रतो हीयते ॥ So also in construction with the word पाप, as, वृत्तेन पापः or वृत्ततः पापः ॥ चारित्रेण पापः or चारित्रतः पापः ॥ This use of the affix is in places other than those where censure is meant: in other words, it comes where no censure is implied but a simple fact is mentioned. Where censure is implied, the affix <i>tasi</i> would come by force of the preceding aphorism [[5.4.46]].

The word अकर्तरि being understood here also, the affix does not come when the 3rd case-affix has the force of an agent: as देवदत्तेन हीयते ॥
