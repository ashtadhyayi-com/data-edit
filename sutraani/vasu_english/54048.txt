The affix तसि comes optionally after a word ending in the Genitive 6th-Case when the sense is that of a party-name or function.
Taking sides with one faction or another is called व्याश्रयः ॥ Thus देवा अर्जुनस्य पक्षेऽभवन् = देवा अर्जुनतोऽभवन् ॥ 'The <i>Devas</i> became <i>Arjunites</i>'. So also आदित्याः कर्णतोऽभवन्. "The <i>Adityas</i> became <i>Karnaites</i>".

Why do we say "when it denotes a Party-name"? Observe, वृक्षस्य शाखा "the branch of the tree".
