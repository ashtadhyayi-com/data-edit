The affix च्वि comes after a word when the agent has attained to the new state expressed by the word, what the thing previously was not and when the verbs कृ 'to make', भू 'to be' and अस् 'to be' are conjoined with it.
The words अभुततद्भावे are not words of <i>Panini</i>, but of the <i>Vartika</i>-<i>Kara</i>, and read into the <i>sutra</i> by the author of <i>Kasika</i>. When something or somebody has become that which is expressed by the stem, then this affix च्वि is added. When the cause of a thing arrives at the state of being that very thing so produced, it is said to be <i>abhutatadbhava</i> 'the state of that what it was not'. The agent of the action of attaining is called <i>sampadya</i> <i>karta</i>. Thus अशुक्लः शुक्लः सम्पद्यते, तं करोति = शुक्लो करोति "he whitens" -- when some one who is not white becomes white i. e. some one makes him so, then we say शुक्ली करोति ॥ So also शुक्ला भवति, शुक्ली स्यात् = मलिनं शुक्ली भवति ॥ The word शुक्ली is thus formed:- शुक्ल + च्वि = शुक्ल् + ई + (the अ of <i>sukla</i> is changed into ई by [[7.4.32]], and the whole affix is elided by [[6.1.67]]) = शुक्ली ॥ Similarly घटी करोति मृदम् 'he makes a jar of the clay': घटी भवति, घटी स्यात् ॥

Why do we say 'becoming that what it was not'? Observe शुक्लं करोति 'he makes white'. Here the thing that has been made white is not expressed, and hence no affixing takes place.

Why do we say "when conjoined with the verbs कृ, भू and अस्?" Observe अशुक्लः शुक्लो जायते. The verb here is जन् 'to produce', and hence no affixing. Why have we used the words <i>sampadya</i> <i>kartari</i> 'the agent that has attained', for even without their use, the words <i>abhuta</i>-<i>tadbhava</i> 'becoming what the thing previously was not', would imply that the attainment was of the agent? The use of <i>sampadya</i>-<i>kartari</i> shows that the attainment spoken of here should be of the 'agent', and not of any other <i>karaka</i>, as, अदेवगृहे देवगृहे भवति 'becoming in the temple what was not before in the temple; such as a tree &c'. Here the <i>karaka</i> is locative and not agent, and the becoming of what the thing previously was not refers to location and not to agency. Hence no affix is added here.
