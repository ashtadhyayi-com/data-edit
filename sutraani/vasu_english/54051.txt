The affix च्वि comes after the words 1. अरुस् 2. मनस् 3. चक्षुस् 4. चेतस् 5. रहस् and 6. रजस् and there is elision of their final consonant.
The affix च्वि would have come after these words by force of the last <i>sutra</i> which is of universal application : the present <i>sutra</i> is made in order to teach the elision of the consonant. Thus अनरुररुः सम्पद्यते, तं करोति = अरू करोति, अरू भवति, अरू स्यात् ॥ So also उन्मनी करोति, भवति or स्यात्, so also उच्चक्षू, विचेती, विरही, and विरजी करोति or भवति or स्यात् ॥ The short उ of अरु and चक्षु is lengthened by [[7.4.26]], and the अ of the other words is changed into ई by [[7.4.32]].
