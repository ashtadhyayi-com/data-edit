The affix साति may be used optionally in the sense of च्वि when something is changed in all its parts into something else.
The whole phrase "when the agent has attained to a state it previously had not and the verbs <i>kri</i>, <i>bhu</i> and <i>asti</i> are in conjunction", is understood here. The affix साति is employed when the original is changed in its totality (कृत्स्न). Thus अग्निसाद् भवति शस्त्रम् "the whole weapon is in a blaze-- has become fire". We may also say अग्नी भवति शस्त्रम् ॥ So also उदकसाद् भवति लवणम् or उदकी भवति लवणम् "The salt becomes all water".

Why do we say "in its totality"? Observe एकदेशेन पटः शुक्ली भवति "the cloth whitens in part".

The word "optionally" shows that the affix <i>chvi</i> also comes in the same sense. While the optional affixing of these terminations <i>chvi</i>, <i>sati</i> &c is governed by the <i>Maha</i>-<i>vibhasha</i> of <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.82]] (see [[5.3.1]].
