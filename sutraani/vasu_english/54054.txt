The affix साति comes after a word expressing 'a master or lord' in the sense of 'dependent upon this' when it is in conjunction with the above verbs 1. कृ 'to make' 2. भू 'to be' 3. अस्ति 'to be' and 4. सम्पद्।
The <i>anuvritti</i> of अभूततद्भावे ceases here, as a different sense altogether is assigned to the affix. The <i>anuvritti</i> of the four verbs <i>Kri</i> &c, however, runs into the <i>sutra</i>. The word तदधीन means 'under the supremacy or control of that', 'under the proprietorship of that'. Proprietor in general and the object of rulership in general are indicated by the word <i>tadadhina</i>. Thus राजाधीनं करोति = राजसात् करोति "he (a king) brings it (a kingdom) under his dominion". Similarly राजसात् स्यात् or भवति or संपद्यते ॥ So also ब्राह्मणसाद् भवति, करोति, स्यात् or संपद्यते ॥
