The affix त्रा comes in the sense of 'to be given to that' as well as the affix साति , in conjunction with the above verbs 1. कृ 'to make' 2. भू 'to be' 3. अस्ति 'to be' and 4. सम्पद्।
The phrase "dependent upon that" is understood here also. The word देय qualifies the above phrase. When a thing which is known as a proper gift for the <i>Brahmanas</i>, is put under their control by offering it to them, then the affix <i>tra</i> is employed. Thus ब्राह्मणाधीनं देयं करोति = ब्राह्मणत्रा or ब्राह्मणसात् करोति "He gives it to the <i>Brahmanas</i>, as it is an object which ought to be given to them". ब्राह्मणत्रा भवति "it becomes given to the <i>Brahmans</i>". So also with यात् and संपद्यते ॥ Why do we say "when the sense is that of to be given"? Observe राजसाद् भवति राष्ट्रम् ॥
