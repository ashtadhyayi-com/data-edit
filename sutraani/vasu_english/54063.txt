The affix डाच् comes after the words 1. सुख and 2. प्रिय followed by कृ 'to make' when the meaning is ('to concede', 'gratify') 'to go with the grain'.
The word आनुलोम्य means 'agreeability', 'to conform to the wishes of the object of adoration'. Thus सुखा करोति, प्रिया करोति स्वामिन् = स्वाम्यादेर्श्चित्तमाराधयति "tries to please the heart of the master &c". This affix comes when, while doing a pleasant or agreeable thing, the idea is to please another by such an act. Otherwise observe: सुखं करोति or प्रियं करोति औषधपानम् "the drinking of medicines gives pleasure &c".
