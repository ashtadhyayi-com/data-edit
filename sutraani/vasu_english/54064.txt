The affix डाच् comes after the word दुःख followed by कृ 'to make' when the sense is that of roasting.
The verb कृ is understood and <i>pratilomya</i> means 'to oppose' or "to act against another's wishes", "to pain the heart of one's master &c". As दुःखा करोति भृत्यः "the servant pains the master".

Why do we say "when meaning to go against the grain"? Observe दुःखं करोति कदन्नम् ॥
