The affix अच् comes after the word उरस् when it follows the word प्रति in a compound and has the sense of the Locative.
Thus प्रत्युरसम् = उरसि वर्त्तते ॥ This is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound, the indeclinable having the force of a <i>vibhakti</i> [[2.1.6]].

Why do we say "when having the sense of the locative?" Observe प्रत्युरः = प्रतिगतमुरः ॥
