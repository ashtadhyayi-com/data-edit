The affix टच् comes after the word उरस् standing at the end of a तत्-पुरुष समास when it has the sense of 'the most excellent of its kind'.
The word अग्र means 'the principal': as the word उरस् is the principal member of an animal, so by metonomy it has come to mean 'the principal'. Thus अश्वानां उरः = अश्वोरसम् so also हस्त्युरसम् "the most excellent of horses or elephants".

Why do we say "when meaning the most excellent". Observe देवदत्तस्योरः = देवदत्तोरः "the breast of <i>Devadatta</i>".
