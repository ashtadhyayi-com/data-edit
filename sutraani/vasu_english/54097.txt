The affix टच् comes after the word श्वन् ending in a तत्-पुरुष समास when another thing not being a living object is compared with it.
Thus आकर्षः श्वेव = आकर्षश्वः 'a dog-like bow'. फलकश्वः "a dog-like blade". This compounding takes place by [[2.1.56]].

Why do we say "when something is likened to it"? Observe न श्वा = अश्वा लोष्टः "a clod of earth which is not a dog". This is not a very happy counter-example of <i>Kasika</i> : for in the case of नञ् <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound there is express prohibition taught in [[5.4.71]]. The proper example should be निःश्वालोष्टः ॥ Why do we say "when the thing compared is not a living being" ? Observe वानरः श्वेव = वानरश्वा "a dog-like monkey".
