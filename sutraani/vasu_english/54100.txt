The affix टच् comes after the word नौ when preceded by the word अर्ध in a तत्-पुरुष समास ।
Thus अर्द्धं नावः = अर्द्धनावम् ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.2.2]]. The compound is of neuter gender, and does not take the gender of the term as required by [[2.4.26]]: for gender is regulated by usage more than any grammatical rules (लोकाश्रयत्वं लिङ्गस्य) ॥
