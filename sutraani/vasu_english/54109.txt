The affix टच् comes optionally after an अव्ययीभाव समास ending with a neuter word whose final syllable is अऩ्।
The word अन् is understood here also. The word 'Neuter' qualifies, the second i. e. last term of the compound. This allows option, where as the previous <i>sutra</i> had made it compulsory. Thus प्रतिचर्मम्, or प्रतिचर्म, उपचर्मम् or उपचर्म ॥
