The affix षच् comes after the words 1. सक्थि and 2. अक्षि , final in a बहुव्रीहि समास and denoting a portion of one's body.
Thus दीर्घे सक्थि यस्य = दीर्घसक्थः, so also कल्याणाक्षः, लोहिताक्षः, विशालाक्षः ॥ The word सक्ष्टपक्ष्णोः is genitive dual, while it ought to be ablative. Why do we say "in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound"? Observe परमसक्थिः, परमाक्षिः ॥ Why do we say "after <i>sakthi</i> and <i>akshi</i>?" Observe दीर्घजानुः, सुबाहुः ॥ Why do we say "when denoting a part of the body?" Observe दीर्घसक्थि शकटं, स्थूलक्षिरिक्षुः ॥

The new affix षच् is employed instead of टच् for the sake of the accent Thus चक्रसक्थी स्त्री, दीर्घसक्थी स्त्री ॥ By <i>sutra</i> [[4.1.41]] the feminine of words ending in an affix having an indicatory ष् is formed by ङीष् and not ङीप् ॥ Had the affix here been टच्, then the feminine would have been formed by ङीप्  [[4.1.15]], which is <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]. Now by rule [[6.2.198]] the second term '<i>saktha</i>' has optionally <i>udatta</i> accent, on this final in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. When therefore, it is not oxytone, then by adding ङीप् the final of दीर्घसक्थी would have been <i>anudatta</i>, so that the feminine in one case would be oxytone, in the other not, which would be anomalous. But when ङीष्  is added, it is always <i>udatta</i>, which is desired: and removes the anomaly. The <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>Bahuvrihi</i> extends up to the end of the chapter.
