The affix अच् comes after the word नासिका final in a बहुव्रीहि समास when an उपसर्ग (Preposition) precedes it and नस् is substituted for नासिका।
This rule applies where the word is not a <i>sanjna</i>, as it was in the last. Thus उन्नता नासिकास्य = उन्नसः, प्रणसः ॥ The न is changed into ण by [[8.4.28]].

Vart:- The ग्र substituted for नासिका when वि precedes it. As, विगतानासिकाऽस्य = विग्रः, so also विख्यः in the same sense.
