The affix इच् comes after a बहुव्रीहि समास when the compound denotes the reciprocity of an action.
The compound denoting reciprocity of action is formed by [[2.2.27]]. Thus केशाकेशि = केशेषु केशेषु गृहीत्वा इदं युद्धं प्रवृत्तं ॥ So also कचाकचि, मुसलामुसलि, दण्डादण्डि ॥ The affix इच् forms also <i>avyayibhava</i> compounds, as it occurs in the list of तिष्ठद्गु  words [[2.1.17]].
