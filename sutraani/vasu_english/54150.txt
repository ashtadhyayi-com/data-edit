The words सुहृत् and दुहृत् are irregularly formed बहुव्रीहि समास denoting 'a friend' and 'a foe' respectively.
The word सुहृत् is derived from सु + हृदय, the अय of हृदय being elided in the <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. It means one whose heart is favourably disposed towards another. So also दुर्हृत् is derived from दुर् + हृदय, he whose heart is evil.

Why do we say "when meaning a friend and a foe respectively"? Observe सुहृदयः कारुणिकः 'the kind-hearted, merciful'. दुर्हृदयश्चोरः "the evil hearted thief".
