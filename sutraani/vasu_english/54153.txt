The affix कप् is added to a बहुव्रीहि समास the last member of which is a feminine word ending in long ई or ऊ defined as नदी words or which ends in a short ऋ।
The word नदी is defined in [[1.4.3]]. Thus बहुकुमारीको देशः (बह्व्यः कुमर्योऽस्मिन्देशे), बहुब्रह्मबन्धूकः ॥ बहुकर्तृकः ॥ The त in ऋत् is for the sake of euphony.
