The word <i>dvitiyasya</i> "of the second syllable", is understood here. This <i>sutra</i> debars the doubling of the consonants <i>n</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>r</i> when forming parts of the second syllable, provided these letters occur in the beginning of a conjunct (<i>sanyoga</i>) letter. Thus the Desiderative root of उन्द is उन्दिष, formed by adding सन् and इट् ॥ The second syllable here is न्दिष् which is to be reduplicated by the last rule. But in doing so, न् will not be doubled. Thus we get the form उन्दिदिषति; so also from अड्ड् and अर्च् we have अड्डिडिषति, and अर्चिचिषति ॥

Why do we say "when न्, द् and र् are the letters"? Observe ईचिक्षिषते from ईक्ष् in which क् is the initial letter and has been reduplicated in to च् ॥ Why do we say "being the first letter in a conjunct consonant"? Observe प्राणिणिषति from the root अन् 'to breathe', the न् being changed into ण् by [[8.4.19]] and [[8.4.21]]. The phrase अजादेः of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood in this <i>sutra</i> also. Thus दरिद्रासति ॥ Some explain the word अजादेः understood in this <i>sutra</i> in the same way as in the last, namely as a <i>karmadharaya</i> compound in the Ablative singular. They do so, in order to explain the form इन्दिद्रीयिषति, which is thus evolved इन्द्रमिच्छति = इन्द्र + क्यच् [[3.1.8]] = इन्द्रीय ॥ Then इन्द्रीयितुमिच्छति = इन्द्रीय + सन् ॥ Here though the second syllable consists of <i>n</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>r</i>, yet न् alone is rejected in reduplication and not द and र also, as द and र are not immediately after the initial vowel (अजादि) इ in this case.

Vart:- This prohibition should be stated with regard to the letter ब् also. As उब्ज् — उब्जिजिषति ॥ This prohibition applies when the word is taught primarily as having a penultimate ब् ॥ But when it is taught as primarily having a penultmate द, then the rule does not apply: the ब should then be ordained as a substitute of द ॥ See <i>Tudadi</i> root 20.

Vart:-There is no prohibition of the र when it is followed by य ॥ Thus अरार्यते ॥ This is the Intensive form of the verb ॠ, and is thus evolved: ॠ + यङ् (III. 1. 22. Vart) = अर् + य [[7.4.30]] = अर्य, then follows reduplication by the rules of this <i>sutra</i>. The second syllable र्य has an initial र which is not however rejected in reduplication.

Vart:- In the case of the verb ईर्ष्यति the third should be reduplicated. "Third of what"? Some say the third of the consonants, and according to them the form is ईर्ष्यियिषति ॥ Some say the third syllable, therefore of the root ईर्ष्यिष (ईर्ष्य + इट् + सन्), the third syllable ष is reduplicated: Thus ईर्ष्यिषष, ईर्ष्यिषिष [[7.4.79]] the अ of ष is changed into short इ by [[7.4.79]] = ईर्ष्यिषिषति ॥

Vart:- The third syllable of the verbs कण्डूय &c. is to be reduplicated. Thus कण्डूय + इट् + सन् = कण्डूयिष = कण्डूयियिषति; so also असूयियिषति &c.

Vart:- The third syllable of verbs derived from nouns is optionally reduplicated. Thus अश्वीयियिषति or अशिश्वीयिषति ॥

Vart:- Others say, any syllable of a नामधातु (verbs derived from nouns) may be reduplicated. Thus from the noun पुत्र is derived the root पुत्रीय, the desiderative root of which is पुत्रीयिष, which requires reduplication. Here any syllable may be reduplicated; as. 1, पुपुत्रीयिषति, 2, पुतित्रीयिषति, 3. पुत्रीयियिषति, 4, पुत्रीयिषिषति ॥ Or there may be double and treble reduplication simultaneously as. पुपुतित्रीयियिषति ॥
