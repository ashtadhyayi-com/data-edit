So also the six roots beginning with जक्षि are called अभ्यस्त।
The word <i>abhyasta</i> is understood here. The verb <i>jakshi</i> and the six verbs that follow it in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, in all seven verbs, get this designation. These are जक्ष, जागृ, दरिद्रा, चकास्, शास्, देधी, and वेवी । <i>Panini</i> has overlooked वेवी and mentions only the first six. By getting the designation of <i>Abhyasta</i> these verbs get acute accent on the first syllable when followed by a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> Tense-affix not having the intermediate इट् and beginning with a vowel. Thus जा꣡ग्रति <i>ja</i>-<i>grati</i>, ज꣡क्षति <i>jakshati</i>, द꣡रिद्रति <i>daridrati</i>, चका꣡सति <i>chakasati</i>, शा꣡शति <i>sasati</i>, दी꣡ध्यते <i>didhyate</i>, and वे꣡व्यते <i>vevyate</i>. The present participle दीध्यत् is irregularly formed by adding the affix शतृ (अत्) and when so formed it does not take the augment नुम् by (VII. I. 78).
