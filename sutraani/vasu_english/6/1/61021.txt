The phrase यङि is understood here. Thus चेकीयते, चेकीयेते, चेकीयन्ते ॥ The exhibition of की in the <i>sutra</i> with a long ई indicates that there is long vowel even in tenses where यङ् is elided, as चेकीतः ॥ For if the <i>sutra</i> had enunciated कि with a short इ as the substitute of चाय्, the forms चेकीयते &c would have been still valid. Thus कि + यङ् = चि + कि + य = चे + कि + य = चे + की + य [[7.4.25]] causing the lengthening of the short इ). But then the <i>Nishtha</i> would have been चेकितः which is wrong.
