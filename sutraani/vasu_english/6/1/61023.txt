The phrases "when the <i>nishtha</i> follows", and "there is vocalisation" are understood here. The <i>anuvritti</i> of स्फी does not run here. The roots स्त्यै and ष्ठ्यै both assume the form स्त्या and are included here. Thus प्र + स्त्या + क्त = प्र + स्ति + त (VI. I. 108) = प्रस्तीतः [[6.4.2]], and प्रस्तीतवान् ॥ The त of <i>nishtha</i> affix would have been changed into न् by [[8.2.43]] in as much as the root स्त्या has a semivowel and ends in long आ ॥ But by the vocalisation of य, the condition of यण्वत् for the application of [[8.2.43]], no longer existing, the affix त is not changed to न ॥ But त is optionally changed to म by [[8.2.54]] as प्रस्तीमः and प्रस्तीमवान् ॥

Why do we say "when preceded by प्र?" Observe संस्त्यानः [[8.2.43]], संस्त्यानवान् ॥ If it was intended that vocalisation should take place when प्र singly stood before, then the <i>sutra</i> could well have run thus प्रस्त्यः ॥ The use of the word पुर्वस्य implies that the rule applies when प्र stands first, though other <i>upasargas</i> may intervene between it and the root. Thus प्रसंस्तीतः, प्रसंस्तीतवान् ॥  The compound प्रपूर्वस्य should be explained as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>= प्रः पूर्वो यस्य धातूपसर्गसमुदायस्य स प्रपूर्व (that which consisting of root and <i>upasarga</i> is preceded by प्र is called प्रपूर्व). Therefore the rule is made applicable to प्रसंस्तीतः &c.
