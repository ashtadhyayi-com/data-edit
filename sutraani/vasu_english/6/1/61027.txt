The word विभाषा is understood here. The roots श्रै 'to cook' of the <i>Bhvadi</i> class, and श्रा 'to cook' of the <i>Adadi</i> class, and श्रा 'to cook' of the <i>Bhvadi</i> sub-class <i>Ghatadi</i>, are meant here. In all these, शृ replaces श्रा, whether causative or not. Thus शृतं क्षीरं, शृतं हविः ॥ This is a <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>; so that श्रा is invariably changed to शृ when referring to क्षीर and हवि, but not anywhere else. Thus श्राणा यवागूः, श्रपिता यवागूः [[7.3.36]] and [[6.4.92]]. This word does not take double causative though the sense may require it. As श्रपितं क्षीरं देवदत्तेन यज्ञदत्तेन "<i>Devadatta</i> through <i>Yajnadatta</i> has caused the milk to be cooked". The श्रा is intransitive. When the sense is that of Reflexive, or Causative, there the form शृत is to be used. As शृतं क्षीरं स्वयमेव, शृतं क्षीरं देवदत्तेन ॥
