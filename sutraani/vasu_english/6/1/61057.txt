The words णौ and हेतुभय are both understood here. The word नित्य shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of विभाषा ceases. Thus मुण्डोजटिलो वा विस्मापयते ॥ Otherwise we have कुञ्चिकयैनं विस्माययति ॥ The word भय here is taken to mean स्मयति i. e. 'wondering', 'feeling astonished'. See [[1.3.68]] where also this meaning has been extended to भय by its connection with भीस्मि together; the proper word ought to have been हेतुस्मये in connection with स्मि, and हेतुभये in connection with भी ॥
