There is the elision of the affix वि when reduced to the single letter व्।
The affix वि includes क्विप्, क्विन्, ण्वि &c. In all these, the real affix is व्, which being an <i>aprikta</i> [[1.2.41]], is elided. Thus ब्रह्महा, भ्रूणहा [[3.2.87]]. Here the affix क्विप् is elided. So also घृतस्पृक्, तैलस्पृक् [[3.2.58]]. Here the affix क्विन् is elided. So also अर्धभाक्, पादभाक्, तुरीयभाक् [[3.2.62]]. Here the affix ण्वि is elided.

Why do we say "of an <i>aprikta</i>-an affix consisting of a single letter"? Observe दर्विः formed by the affix विन् (वि being the real affix); so also जागृविः formed क्विन्, see <i>Unadi</i> <i>Sutras</i> IV. 53. 44. No root can become a noun unless some <i>krit</i> affix is added to it (see [[1.2.45]] and [[1.2.46]]); hence the necessity of these imaginary affixes, in order to raise certain roots bodily, without any change, to the rank of nouns--from <i>Dhatu</i> to a <i>Pratipadika</i> the way lies only through an affix. And though these imaginary affixes are after all totally elided, yet by [[1.1.62]], they leave their characteristic mark behind, namely the derivative word becomes a nominal stem &c. Thus च्वि words are adverbs (<i>Gati</i>) and Indeclinables.
