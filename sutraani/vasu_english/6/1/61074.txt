The Particle आ has the four senses of 1. littleness (ईषदर्थे) 2. with verbs, as a prefix (क्रियायोगः) 3. the limit inceptive (अभिविधि) and 4. the limit exclusive (मर्यादा). This <i>sutra</i> ordains तुक् necessarily, where by [[6.1.76]], it would have been optional. Thus ईषच्छाया = आच्छाया; 2. With verbs:-as आच्छादयति, 3 and 4., आच्छायायाः, आच्छायम् ॥  So also the negative particle मा, as, माच्छैत्सीत्, माच्छिदत् ॥ The ङ् in आङ् and माङ् shows that आ when used as a <i>Gati</i> and a <i>Karmapravachaniya</i> and मा when used as a negative particle are meant. Therefore, the त् is not necessary in the following :-आछाया मानयति, प्रमाछन्दः ॥ The तुक may be optionally added in these as आच्छाया and प्रमाच्छन्दः ॥ The आ here has the force of recollection (स्मरण); आछाया "Oh the shade". The word प्रमा is formed from the verbal root माङ् by the prefix प्र and the affix अङ् [[3.3.106]] with the feminine affix टाप्, and the word ending in टाप् has not the indicatory ङ् ॥
