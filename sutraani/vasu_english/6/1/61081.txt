The roots क्षि and जि before the affix यत् [[3.1.97]] assume these forms when meaning to be able to do the action denoted by the verb. As शक्यः क्षेतुं = क्षय्यः (क्षि + य = क्षे + य); so also जय्यः ॥ Why do we say when meaning "to be possible to do"? Observe क्षेयं पापं, जैयो वृषलः ॥ Here the meaning is that of 'necessity'.
