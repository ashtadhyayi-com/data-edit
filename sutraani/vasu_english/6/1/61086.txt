The substitution of the final आदेश is to be considered as to have not taken effect, when otherwise स would have changed to ष , or when the augment त् (तुक्) is to be added.
The word असिद्ध means not-accomplished i. e. the operation caused by its having taken effect is not produced. The word <i>asiddha</i> always debars operations dependent upon this <i>adesa</i>, and gives scope to the operations dependent upon the general rule ( असिद्धवचनमादेशलक्षणप्रतिषेदार्थमुत्संगलक्षणभावार्थं च ॥) Thus कांऽसिचत् here स is not changed to ष ॥ The equation is thus exhibited : कस् + असिचत् = कर् + असिचत् (the स changed to र by [[8.2.66]]) कंउ + असिचत् (उ being substituted for र by [[6.1.113]]) = को + असिचत् (अ + उ = ओ [[6.1.87]])  = कोऽसिचत् (ओ + अ = ओ [[6.1.109]]). Now applies our <i>sutra</i>. By [[8.3.59]], स coming after ओ required to be changed into ष, but here the single-substitute ओ is considered to be non-effective for this purpose. Similarly कोऽस्य, योऽस्य, कोऽस्मै, यौऽस्मै ॥ Similarly in अधीत्य there is the addition of त् by [[6.1.71]], though actually preceded by a long vowel. That long vowel had resulted from the <i>ekadesa</i> of ई for इ + इ, and this <i>ekadesa</i> is considered as if non-effective for the purposes of तुक् augment. Similarly in प्र + इ + तुक् + य = प्रेत्य. Here also अ + इ = ए is considered <i>asiddha</i>.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of <i>samprasarana</i>, the Locative singular case-ending is ङि (इ), and the Ist person singular <i>Atmanepada</i> affix इट् ॥ Of vocalisation we have the following : शकहूष् = शकान् ह्वयति, then we add क्विप्, before which there is vocalisation of व्, this उ combining with in the following आ becomes उ <i>ekadesa</i>: as शकहा + क्विप् = शकह्उआ + ० (VI. I. I5) + शकहु (VI. I. 108). The Locative plural is formed by सु : शकहु + सु = शकहूषु (the lengthening taking place by [[6.4.2]]). Here स is changed to ष the <i>ekadesa</i> उ for उ + अ not being considered <i>asiddha</i>. So also परिवीषु (परि + ष्ये + क्विप् = परि + व्इए + क्विप् = परिवि, add सु)॥ Of the affix ङि we have:- वृक्ष + इ = वृक्षे, add छत्रम्, then the single substitute ए being considered not <i>asiddha</i> we have वृक्षेच्छत्रम् or वृक्षेछत्रम् ॥ Of the affix इट् of Ist Person <i>Atmanepada</i> we have अपचे + छत्रम् = अपचेच्छत्रम् or अपचेछत्रम् ॥  In both these cases we optionally add तुक् by (VI. I. 75) - (VI. I. 76), by considering the <i>ekadesa</i> [[6.1.87]] as to have taken effect, and making the finals दीर्घ or long. Here the <i>ekadesa</i> is not <i>asiddha</i> and therefore तुक् is optional and not compulsory.
