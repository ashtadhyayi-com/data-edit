Thus एषः + ददाति = एष ददाति, स ददाति, एष भुङ्क्ते, स भुङ्क्ते ॥ Why do we say of एतद् and तद्? Observe यो ददाति, यो भुङ्क्ते ॥ Why do say "the case affix of the Nominative singular?" Observe एतौ गावौ चरतः ॥ Why do we say 'without क'? Observe एषको ददाति, सको ददाति ॥ The words एतद् and तद् with the affix अद्यच्, which falls in the middle, would be considered just like एतत् and तद् without such affix, and in fact would be included in the words एतद् and तद्, hence the necessity of the prohibition. The general maxim is: तन्मध्यपतितस्तद् ग्रहणेन गृह्यते 'any term that may be employed in Grammar denotes not merely what is actually denoted by it, but it denotes also whatever word-form may result when something is inserted in that which is actually denoted by it".

Why do we say "when not compounded with the negative particle"? Observe अनेषो ददाति, असो ददाति ॥ In the compound with the negative particle नञ्, the second member is the principal and takes the case affixes. Why do we say 'when followed by a consonant'? Observe एषोऽत्र, सोऽत्र ॥
