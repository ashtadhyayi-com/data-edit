The कुस्तुम्बुरु is the name of coriander - i. e. धान्यकं; the seeds are also so called. The exhibition of the word in the <i>sutra</i> in the Neuter gender does not however show that the word is always Neuter. When not meaning coriander, the form is कुतुम्बुरु (कुत्सितानि तुम्बुरूणि) ॥ The word तुम्बुरु here means the fruit of the ebony tree.
