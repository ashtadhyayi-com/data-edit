The word चतुर् , followed by the Accusative Plural, has acute accent on the last syllable.
Thus च॒॒तु꣡रः पश्य the accent is on तु ॥ The feminine of चतुर् is चतसृ [[7.2.99]], which has acute accent on the first [[7.2.99]] <i>Vartika</i>)), and its accusative plural will not have accent on the last syllable. This is so, because चतुर् has acute on the first, as formed by उरन् affix. Its substitute चतसृ will also be so, by the rule of स्थानिवत् ॥ The special enunciation of आद्युदात्त with regard to चतसृ in the <i>Vartika</i> चतसर्याद्युदात्तनिपातनं कर्तव्यं [[7.2.99]] indicates that the present rule does not apply to चतसृ ॥ Another reason for this is as follows: चतसृ + शस् = चतसृ + शस् ॥ Now comes the present <i>Sutra</i>; here, however, the र् substitute of ऋ being <i>sthanivat</i>, will prevent the <i>udatta</i> formation of the अ of त; nor will ऋ be considered as final and take the acute, as there exists no vowels ऋ but a consonant र् which cannot take an accent. As चतस्रः पश्य ॥ Professor Bohtlingk places the accent thus चतुरः꣡, Professor Max Muller चतु꣡रः ॥ I have followed Professor Max Muller in interpreting this <i>sutra</i>; for Bohtlingk's interpretation would make the ending शस् accented, and not the final of चतुर् ॥
