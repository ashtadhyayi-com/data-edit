After an oxytone Particle in अत् the feminine suffix ई , (नदि) and the case endings beginning with vowels (with the exception of strong cases) have acute accent, when the participial affix has not the augment न् (i.e. is not अन्त).
The word अन्तोदात्तात् 'after an oxytoned word' is understood here. Thus तुद॒॒ती꣡, नुद॒॒ती꣡, लुनती, पुन॒॒ती꣡, तुदता꣡, लुन॒॒ता꣡, पुन॒॒ता꣡, सुन॒॒ता꣡ from तुद꣡त्, नुद꣡त् लुन꣡त् and पुन꣡त् ॥

Why do we say "not having the augment मुम्?" Observe तुदन्ती, नुद꣡न्ती ॥ Here also by [[6.1.186]], after the root तुद् which has an indicatory अ, in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, being written तुद, the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix शतृ (अत्) is <i>anudatta</i>. This <i>anudatta</i> अत्, coalescing with the <i>udatta</i> अ of तुद (VI. I. 162), becomes <i>udatta</i> [[8.2.5]]; and Rule (VIII. 2. I) not being held applicable here, the Participle gets the accent, and not the feminine affix. Why do we say "a नदी (feminine in ई) word and before vowel-endings?" Observe तुद꣡द्भ्याम्, नुद꣡द्भ्याम् &c. If the participle is not an oxytone, the rule does not apply. As द꣡दती, द꣡धती ॥ Here the accent is on the first syllable by [[6.1.189]].

Vart:- The words बृहती and महती should also be included : as बृहती꣡ महती꣡, बृहता꣡, महता꣡ ॥
