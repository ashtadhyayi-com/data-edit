This debars the accent on the beginning. Thus बिभे꣡ति, जिहे꣡ति, बिभ꣡र्त्ति, जुहो꣡ति, मम꣡त्तु नः परिज्मा ॥ Here the root मद has diversely taken in the <i>Chhandas</i> the <i>vikarana</i> श्लु, though it belongs to <i>Divadi</i> class. जज꣡नत्, इन्द्रम् ॥ The verb is here लेट् or the Vedic Subjunctive, so also is the next example. दधनत् from धन धान्ये, the इ of ति being elided by [[3.4.97]]. and the augment अट् being added by [[3.4.94]]. दध꣡नत्, दरिद्रा꣡ति, जाग꣡र्त्ति ॥ In the case of other verbs we have द꣡दाति ॥ Before affixes which have not the indicatory प् (i. e. all endings other than the three singular endings), the accent will be on the first syllable: as द꣡रिद्रति ॥
