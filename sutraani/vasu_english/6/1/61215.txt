Thus वे꣡णुः or वेणुः꣡; इ꣡न्धानः or इन्धा꣡नः or इन्धानः꣡ ॥ The word वेणु is derived by the <i>Unadi</i> affix णु (III. 38), which being a नित् would always have acute on the first. This allows an option. The word इन्धान, if it is formed by चानश् it will have the accent on the final. If it is considered to be formed by शानच्, the affix being a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> is <i>anudatta</i>, and as it replaces <i>udatta</i> final of the root, it becomes <i>udatta</i> [[6.1.161]], and thus इन्धान gets acute on the middle. It would never have acute on the first syllable, the present rule ordains that also. When वेणु is used as an -<i>upamana</i> वेणुरिव वेणुः, then it is invariably acutely accented on the first [[6.1.204]].
