Thus कृष्ण꣡सारङ्गी, लो꣡हितसारङ्गी, कृष्ण꣡कल्माषः, लो꣡हितकल्माषः ॥ कृष्ण is formed by मक् affix (<i>Unadi</i>. III. 4) and has acute on the final [[3.1.3]]. लोहित is formed by the affix तन् added to रुह् (<i>Unadi</i>, III. 94) and has accent on the first [[6.1.197]].

Why do we say 'color-denoting word'? Observe परमकृष्णः꣡ [[6.1.223]]. Why do we say 'with another color denoting word'? Observe कृष्णतिलाः꣡ [[6.1.223]]. Why do we say 'but not when it is एत'? Observe कृष्णेतः꣡, लोहितैतः꣡ ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.1.69]].
