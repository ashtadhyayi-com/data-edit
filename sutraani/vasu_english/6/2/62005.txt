In a तत्-पुरुष समास having the word दायद् as its second member, the first member denoting inheritance preserves its original accent.
Thus विद्या꣡दायादः, ध꣡नदायादः ॥ The word विद्या꣡ is formed by the affix क्यप् [[3.3.99]] which is <i>udatta</i> [[3.3.96]]. The word धन is derived by adding क्यु to धाञ् (<i>Unadi</i>. II. 81). Though the <i>Unadi</i> <i>Sutra</i> II. 81 ordains क्यु after the root धा preceded by नि, yet by बहुल [[3.3.1]] rule it comes after धा also when it is not preceded by नि and धन has acute on the first [[3.1.3]].

In the forms विद्यादायादः &c, what Genitive case has been taken? If it is the Genitive case which the word दायाद requires by Rule [[2.3.39]], then by the <i>Vartika</i> प्रतिपदविधाना च षष्ठी न समस्यते (II. 2. 10 <i>Vartika</i>), there can be no compounding. The Genitive case there is the ordinary Genitive case of [[2.3.50]]. i. e. a शैषिक Genitive case, and not a प्रतिपद Genitive. If it is a शेषलक्षण Genitive case, then why the other Genitive case is taught in [[2.3.39]] with regard to दायाद &c. That <i>sutra</i> only indicates the existence of the Locative case in the alternative, and does not prevent the Genitive. In fact, had merely Locative been ordained in that <i>sutra</i>, this particular case would have prevented the Genitive on the maxim that a particular rule debars the general. But the employment of both terms Genitive and Locative in that <i>sutra</i> indicates the alternative nature of the rule and shows that the Genitive case so taught is not a प्रतिपद Genitive, but a general Genitive. In short the Genitive taught in [[2.3.39]], is not an <i>apurva</i>-<i>vidhi</i>, the words naturally would have taken Genitive; the taking of the Locative is the only new thing taught there.

Why do we say 'when meaning inheritance'? Observe परमदायादः [[6.1.223]] taking the final acute of a compound.
