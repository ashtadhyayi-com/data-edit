The word अपदेश means 'a pretext', 'a contrivance'. Thus मूत्र꣡पदेन प्रस्थितः, उच्चार꣡पदेन प्रस्थितः ॥ Gone pretext of voiding urine or excreta.

The word मूत्र is derived by adding the affix ष्ट्रन् to the root मुच्, the ऊ being substituted for उच् of मुच्, (<i>Unadi</i>. IV. 163), and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]] or it may be a word formed by घञ् to the root मूत्रयति ॥ The word उच्चार is also formed by घञ् and by [[6.2.144]] has acute on the final. The compounding takes place by [[2.1.72]] or it is an attributive compound.

Why do we say "when meaning a pretext?" Observe विष्णोः पदम् = विष्णुपद꣡म् ॥
