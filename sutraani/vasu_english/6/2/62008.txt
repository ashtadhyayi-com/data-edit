The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when the second member is the word निवात in the sense of 'a protection from wind'.
Thus कुट्येवं निवातं = कु॒॒꣡टीनिवातम् 'a hut as the only shelter from the wind'. So also श꣡मीनिवातम्, कु꣡ड्यनिवातम् or कुड्य꣡निवातम् ॥ The word निवात is an <i>Avyayibhava</i> compound = वातस्य अभावः [[2.1.6]]: or a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> = निरुद्धो वातोऽस्मिन् ॥ The words कुटीनिवातम् &c, are examples of compounds of two words in apposition. कुटी and शमी are formed by ङीष् [[4.1.41]] and have acute on the last [[3.1.3]]. Some say that कुड्य is derived from कु by adding यत् with the augment डक् and treating it as कित्, is has the acute on the first; others hold that it is derived by the affix ड्यक् to कु and the affix has the accent.

Why do we say when meaning 'a shelter from wind'? Observe राजनिवाते꣡ वसति, सुखं मातृनिवातं꣡ = 'he lives under the shelter of the king'; 'pleasant is the shelter or the protection of the mother'. Here निवात = पार्श्वः or vicinity.
