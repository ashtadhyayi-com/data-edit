The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when the second member is the word सदृश or प्रतिरूप expressing resemblance with someone or something.
Thus पितृ꣡सदृशः, मातृ꣡सदृशः ॥ The words पितृ and मातृ are formed by <i>Unadi</i> affix तृच् (<i>Unadi</i> II. 95) and are finally accented. By [[2.1.31]], सदृश forms Instrumental <i>Tatpurusha</i>. That case, however, is governed by [[6.2.2]], which provides for Instrumental compounds. The examples here given are of Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i>: and it applies to cases where the case-ending is not elided. As दास्याः꣡ सदृशो, वृषल्या꣡ सदृशः ॥ Here दासी and वृषली are finally acute, and the case-affix gets the accent when semivowel is substituted [[6.1.174]]. So also पितृ꣡प्रतिरूपः, मातृ꣡प्रतिरूपः ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning resemblance'? Observe परमसदृशः꣡, उत्तमसदृशः꣡ (VI. I. 223): here the sense of the compound is that of 'honor' and not 'resemblance'.
