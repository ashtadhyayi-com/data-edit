Thus ग꣡मनश्रेष्ठम्, or ग꣡मनश्रेयः, व꣡चनज्येष्ठम् or वचनज्यायः, ग꣡मनावमम्, व꣡चनावमम्, ग꣡मनकनिष्ठम् or गमनकनीयः ॥ So also ग꣡मनपापिष्ठम्, ग꣡मनपापीयः ॥ All the first members are ल्युट् formed words and have लित् accent i. e. on the first syllable. [[6.1.193]]. The words श्र, ज्य and कन् are substitutes which certain adjectives take in the comparative and superlative degree, and the employment of these forms in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the comparative and superlative words having these elements should be taken as second members, and so also of पाप, the comparative and superlative are taken, for this is the meaning here of the word पापवत् ॥

Why do we say "श्र &c"? Observe गमनशोभनम् ॥ Why do we say 'a verbal Noun'? Observe गमनश्रेयः, where the word गमन is = गम्यतेऽनेन 'the carriage'. Why do we say 'a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound'? Observe गमनं श्रेयः = गमनश्रेयः ॥
