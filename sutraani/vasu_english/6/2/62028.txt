The word पूग means 'a multitude, a collection &c'. See [[5.3.112]] also. Thus कु꣡मारचातकाः or कुमार꣡चातका [[6.2.26]], or कुमारचातकाः꣡ ॥ So also कु꣡मारलोहध्वजाः or कुमार꣡लोहध्वजाः or कुमारलोहध्वजाः꣡ ॥ So also with कु꣡मार꣡बलाहकाः꣡, कु꣡मार꣡जीमूतकाः꣡ ॥ Here चातक &c, are horde-names; and the affix ञ्य is added to them by [[5.3.112]]: which is elided in the Plural by [[2.4.62]]. In the above examples when the word '<i>Kumara</i>' is not accented on the first syllable, it gets accent on the last by [[6.2.26]], when the प्रतिपदोक्त maxim is not applied : when that maxim is applied, the final of the compound takes the accent by the general rule (VI. I. 223).
