So also निध꣡नशुष्कः, ऊक꣡शुष्कः ॥ The word निधन is derived by क्यु affix added to नि-धाञ् and has acute on the middle; the word ऊक is formed from अव् root by the affix कक्, and has acute on the final. So also भ्रा꣡ष्ट्रपक्वः, कुम्भी꣡पक्वः, कलशी꣡पक्वः ॥ The words <i>Kumbhi</i> and <i>Kalasi</i> are formed by ङीष् affix and have acute on the final; the word भ्राष्ट्र is formed by ष्ट्रन् affix, and has acute on the beginning. So also चक्र꣡बन्धः चा꣡रकबन्धः ॥ The word <i>chakra</i> has acute on the final, and <i>charaka</i> being formed by ण्वुल् has acute on the first.
