Thus यू꣡पदारु, कुण्डल꣡हिरण्यम् ॥ The word यूप् has accent on the first syllable, as it is formed by प (<i>Unadi</i> III. 27) treated as a नित् (<i>Unadi</i> III. 26). The word कुण्डल is formed by कल affix which is treated as चित् (<i>Unadi</i> I. 108) and has acute on the final. So also र꣡थदारु, वल्लीहिरण्यम् ॥ <i>Ratha</i> is first-acute formed by <i>kthan</i> affix (<i>Unadi</i> II. 2). <i>Valli</i> has acute on the final formed by ङीष् affix. [[4.1.41]] Why do we say 'it being suited to the first'? Observe कुबेरबलिः ॥ This accent applies when the second member denoting the material is modified into the first by workmanship. The composition takes place by [[2.1.36]].
