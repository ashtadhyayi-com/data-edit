Before the Past Participle in क्त the first member when it itself is not a Past Participle, retains its original accent in a कर्मधारय समास ।
This rule is confined to the Past Participles and the Nouns specifically mentioned in [[2.1.59]]; on the maxim of <i>pratipadokta</i> &c. Thus श्रेणिकृताः, पूग꣡कृताः, ऊक꣡कृताः, निध꣡नकृताः ॥ The word श्रे꣡णि has acute on the first as it is formed by the affix नि which is considered नित् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 51). The word पूग is end-acute as it is formed by the affix गक् (<i>Unadi</i> I. 124). The word ऊक is also end-acute [[6.2.32]]. The word निध has acute on the middle. Why do we say in a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound? Observe श्रेण्या कृतं = श्रेनिकृत꣡म् ॥ Why do we say 'when it is a non-<i>nishtha</i> word ?' Observe कृताकृतम् ॥ Here the compounding is by [[2.1.60]].
