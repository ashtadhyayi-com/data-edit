Before the Past Participle in क्त , a word ending in the Accusative -2nd case retains its accent when it does not mean a separation.
Thus कष्ट꣡श्रितः, त्रिश꣡कलपतितः, ग्रा꣡मगतः ॥ <i>Kashta</i> has acute on the end, <i>trisakala</i> is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound (<i>trini</i> <i>sakalani</i> <i>asya</i>), and consequently acute on the first : <i>grama</i> has acute on the first as it is formed by the नित् affix मन् added to ग्रस्, the final being replaced by आ (<i>Unadi</i> I. 143) ॥ Why do we say 'when not meaning separation'? Observe कान्तारातीतः꣡, योजनातीतः,  because one has taken himself beyond <i>kantara</i> and <i>yojana</i>.

Vart:- This rule does not apply when the Past Participle has an <i>upasarga</i> attached; as सुखप्राप्तः꣡, दुःखप्राप्तः꣡, सुखापन्नः꣡, दुःखापन्नः꣡ [[6.4.144]]. This is an exception to rule [[6.2.144]].
