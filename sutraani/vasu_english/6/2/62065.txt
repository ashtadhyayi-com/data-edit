The word हारिण् means 'appropriates the dues or taxes': and धर्म्यम् means 'the due or tax which has been determined by the custom or usage, of the country, town, sect or family, that which one is lawfully entitled to get'. The word धर्म्य is formed by यत् under [[4.4.91]] and [[4.4.92]] and has the sense of both. Of Locative words we have the following examples : - स्तु꣡पे-शाणः मु꣡कुटे- कार्षापणम्, ह꣡ले-द्विपदिका, ह꣡ले-त्रिपदिका, दृ꣡षदि-माषकः ॥ These compounds are formed under [[2.1.44]], and the sign of the Locative is not elided by [[6.3.9]] and [[6.3.10]]. With the name of a due-receiver हारी we have the following :- या꣡ज्ञिकाश्वः 'the horse which is the customary due of the sacrificer'. So also वै꣡याकरणहस्ती, मा꣡तुलाश्वः, पि꣡तृव्यगवः ॥ In some places the established usage is to give a शाण coin in every sacred Tope &c, or to give a horse to a sacrificer &c. Why do we say 'what is lawful'? Observe स्तम्बेरमः꣡, कर्मकर वर्द्धितकः꣡ वर्द्धितको नाम मूले स्थूलोग्रे सूक्ष्म ओदन पिण्डः, स कर्मकराय दीयते, अन्यथा कर्म न कुर्यादिति, न त्वयं धर्मः ॥ Why do we say "but not before हरण"? Observe वाडवहरण꣡म् ' that which is given to a mare'. हरण is that customary food which is given to a mare after she has been covored, in order to strengthen her. The word हरण is a <i>Krit</i>-formed word, its exclusion here indicates that other <i>Krit</i>-formed words however are governed by this rule when preceded by a हारी denoting word; and thus this <i>sutra</i> supersedes the <i>Krit</i> accent enjoined by [[6.2.139]], so far. Thus वाडवहार्यः has acute on the first by this rule, the subsequent [[6.2.139]] not applying.
