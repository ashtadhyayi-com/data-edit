Thus भि꣡क्षावासः, भ꣡क्तकंसः, श्रा꣡णाकंसः, भा꣡जीकंसः ॥ The words like भिक्षा, भक्त &c, are names of food. Why do we say 'when denoting the name of food'? Observe समाशशालयः꣡ (the word समाश = समशनं is the name of an 'action' and not of a 'substance'). Why do we say <i>tadartheshu</i> suited to contain that'? Observe भिक्षा꣡प्रियः, which is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, and the first member gets acute on the final.
