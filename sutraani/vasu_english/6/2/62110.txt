Thus प्रधौत꣡मुखः or प्रधौतमुखः꣡ [[6.2.169]], or प्र꣡धौतमुखः [[6.2.49]] and [[6.2.1]] प्रक्षालित꣡पादः or प्र꣡क्षालितपादः ॥ When the word मुखः means (mouth) then by [[6.2.167]] which is an optional rule, the accent falls on the last syllable खः ॥ When the other alternative is taken or when it does not mean (mouth) then by [[6.2.49]] the acute falls on प्र, which accent is retained [[6.2.1]]. Why do we say "a <i>Nishtha</i>"? Observe प्रसवकमुखः which is acute in the middle by the <i>krit</i> accent being retained after प्र [[6.2.139]]. Why do we say 'preceded by a preposition'? Observe शुष्कमुखम् which has acute on the first by [[6.1.206]].
