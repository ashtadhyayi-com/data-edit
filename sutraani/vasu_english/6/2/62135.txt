As दर्भका꣡ण्डम्, शरका꣡ण्डम्; दर्भची꣡रम्, कुशची꣡रम् ॥ In the last two examples चीर is not used as a comparison, that case being governed by [[6.2.127]], तिलप꣡ललम्, मूलकशाक꣡म्, मुद्गसू꣡पः ॥ Here पलल, सूप and शाक do not denote mixing, which is governed by [[6.2.128]]. नन्दीकू꣡लम्, समुद्रकू꣡लम्, here the compound does not denote a Name, which would be the case under [[6.2.129]]. Why these 'six' only? Observe राजसूदः ॥
