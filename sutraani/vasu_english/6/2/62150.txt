Thus ओदनभोजनं꣡ सुखम्, पयपानं꣡ सुखम्, चन्दनप्रियङ्गुकालेपनं꣡ सुखम् ॥ All these are examples of भाव or Abstract Verbal Nouns. राजभोजनाः꣡ शालयः, राजाच्छादनानि꣡ वासांसि, are examples of कर्मवचन or Passive Adjectives. These are formed by ल्युट् under [[3.3.116]]. For the <i>Sutra</i> [[3.3.116]] may be explained by saying that (1) ल्युट् is applied when the <i>Upapada</i> is in the objective case and <i>bhava</i> is meant, (2) as well as when object is to be expressed. When the first explanation is taken, the above are examples of <i>Bhava</i>; when the second explanation is taken, they are examples pf <i>Karma</i>. Why do we say "ending in अन्"? Observe, हस्तहा॑र्यमुदश्चित् ॥ Why do we say "when expressing an action in the abstract (<i>bhava</i>), or an Object (<i>karma</i>)"? Observe दन्तधाव꣡नम्, here ल्युट् is added after an Instrumental <i>karaka</i> [[3.3.117]]. Why do we say "after a <i>karaka</i>"? Observe निदर्श꣡नम्, अवलेख꣡नम् ॥ In all the counter-examples, the second members retain their original accent.
