Thus: अव्ययः - उच्चै꣡र्मुखः, नीचै꣡र्मुखः ॥ The words उच्चैः and नीचैः are finally acute and retain their accent. दिक् - प्रा꣡ङ्मुखः, प्रत्य꣡ङ्मुखः ॥ The word प्राङ् has acute on the first by [[6.2.52]], and प्रत्यङ् is finally acute by [[6.3.139]]. गो &c :- गो꣡मुखः, महा꣡मुखः, स्थूल꣡मुखः, मुष्टिमु꣡खः पृथु꣡मुखः and वत्स꣡मुखः ॥ In these the first members of the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> preserve their respective accents under Rule [[6.2.1]] and in the case of compounds preceded by गो, मुष्टि and वत्स, the optional rule taught in the next <i>sutra</i> is also superseded by anticipation, though the words may denote comparison.
