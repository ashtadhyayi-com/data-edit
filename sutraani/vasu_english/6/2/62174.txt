Thus अय꣡वकोदेशः, अव्री꣡हिकः, अमा꣡षकः, सुय꣡वकः, सुव्री꣡हिकः, सुमा꣡꣡षकः ॥ The repetition of पूर्व in this <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was present from the last shows, that in the last aphorism, the syllable preceding कप् takes the acute, while here the syllable preceding the short-vowel-ending final syllable has the acute and not the syllable preceding कप् ॥ This is possible with a word which is, at least, of two syllables (not counting, of course, सु and क or कप्). Therefore, in अज्ञ꣡कः and सुज्ञ꣡कः, the acute is on the syllable preceding कप् by [[6.2.173]], because it has here no <i>antyat</i>-<i>purvam</i>.
