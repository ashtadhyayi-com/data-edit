The words अलुक् 'there is no elision', and उत्तरपदे "before the second member" are to be supplied in the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. Both these words govern the <i>sutras</i> upto [[6.3.24]], jointly; while उत्तरपदे extends further upto that point whence commences the jurisdiction of अङ्ग [[6.4.1]]. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.2]] says "the affixes of the Ablative after '<i>stoka</i>' &c". The present <i>sutra</i> should be read there to complete the sense, e. g. "the affixes of the Ablative after <i>stoka</i> &c are not elided before the second member of the compound". Thus स्तोकात् मुक्तः = स्तोकान्मुक्तः, अल्पान्मुक्तः ॥ Why do we say "before the second member"? Observe निष्क्रान्तः स्तोकात् = निःस्तोकः ॥ The maxim of <i>pratipadokta</i> does not apply here.
