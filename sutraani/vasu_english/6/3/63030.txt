Thus दिवस्पृथिव्यौ, द्यावापृथिव्यौ ॥ The word दिवस् is exhibited in the aphorism as दिवस् ending in अ, in order to indicate that the स् of दिवस् is not changed to ह् or a <i>visarga</i> or <i>upadhmaniya</i> when followed by पृथिवी ॥ Following is an anomalous use there being no <i>Dvandva</i> compounding here. द्यावा चिदस्मै पृथिवी ममेते ॥
