हृद् is optionally substituted for हृदय before the words शोक and रोग or the affix ष्यङ् follow.
Thus हृच्छोकः or हृदयशोकः, सौहार्द्यम् or सौहृदय्यम् ॥ Here ष्यङ् is added as हृदय belongs to <i>Brahmanadi</i> class (V. I. I24). When हृद् is substituted there is <i>Vriddhi</i> of both the members सु and हृ by [[7.3.19]]. So also हृद्रोगः or हृदयरोगः ॥ All these forms could have been got from हृत् which is a full word sui generis, having the same meaning as हृदय ॥ The substitution taught in this <i>sutra</i> is rather unnecessary.
