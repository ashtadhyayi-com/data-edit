Of the two things which are generally found co-existing, the non-principal is called the 'second' or द्वितीया ॥ That which is perceived, observed or is known is called उपाख्य, that which is not perceived &c is अनुपाख्य, i.e. what is to be inferred. That is, when the second object is to be inferred from the presence of the first, स is added to such second word. Thus साग्निः (कपोतः) 'a pigeon which points out that conflagration has taken place some where'. सपिशाचा वात्या "a storm-wind which announces the <i>Pisachas</i>". सराक्षसीका शाला ॥ Here the fire, the <i>Pisacha</i> or the <i>Rakshasas</i> are not directly perceived, but their existence is inferred from the presence of the pigeon &c.
