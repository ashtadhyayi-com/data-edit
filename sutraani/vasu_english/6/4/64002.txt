Both the words दीर्घ and अण् from [[6.3.111]], and संप्रसारण from [[6.3.139]] are understood here. Thus हूतः from ह्वा, जीनः from ज्या, संवीतः from व्या ॥ Why do we say 'preceded by a consonant'? Observe उतः and उतवान् from वेञ् ॥ Why do we say that the preceding consonant should be a portion of the stem? Observe निरुतम्, here र is not an integral part of the stem, but a portion of the <i>upasarga</i> निर् and therefore उ is not lengthened. Why do we say 'at the end of a stem'? Observe विद्धः, विचितः from व्यध् and व्यच्; here the vowel इ is in the middle of the stem. Why do we say 'अ, इ and उ substitutes of semivowels'? Observe तृतीयः ॥ Here त्रि has been vocalised into तृ, ऋ being substituted for र् before the affix तीय [[5.2.55]]. There ऋ will not be lengthened. Or the absence of lengthening in तृतीय is an irregularity countenanced by <i>Panini</i> himself in <i>sutras</i> like [[2.1.30]] &c. The word अङ्ग should be repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, first to qualify the word हल, and then to qualify the letters अ, इ and उ ॥
