For च्छ (including the augment तुक्) is substituted श् and for व् is substituted ऊठ् before an affix beginning with a nasal as well as before क्वि and झलादि ङित् and कित् affixes -- अनुनासिकस्य क्विझलोः क्ङिति [[6.4.15]].
Thus प्रश्नः, विश्नः from प्रच्छ and विच्छ, with the affix नङ् [[3.3.90]] the च्छ being replaced by श ॥ Similarly from the root सिव् we have स्थोनः thus: सिव् + न (<i>Unadi</i> III. 9). = सि + ऊ + न = स्थू + न = स्थोनः [[7.3.84]]. Here the ऊ is added to the stem prior to the scope being given to the <i>guna</i> rule of [[7.3.86]], otherwise the form would be सिव्  + न = सेव् + न = से + ऊ + न ॥ Having thus added ऊ, before scope could be given to the <i>guna</i> rule [[7.3.86]], we make <i>sandhi</i> of सि + ऊ = स्थू, because semivowel substitution is <i>antaranga</i> operation and of wider scope than <i>guna</i>, and the maxim of वार्णादाङ्ग बलीयो भवति has no scope here. "An operation which is taught in the <i>Angadhikara</i>, and affects the <i>anga</i> or stem, possesses force than an operation which concerns a combination of letters (i. e. is taught in a <i>sandhi</i> rule)".

With क्वि we have शब्दप्राश् formed with क्विप् (<i>Unadi</i> 11.57 ) added to प्रच्छ, there is no vocalisation of the semivowel र, and there is lengthening of अ, and च्छ changed to श. So also गोविश् ॥

Of the change of व into ऊ we have the following :- अक्षद्यूः, हिरण्यद्यूः (दिव् + क्विप् = दि + ऊ = द्यूः) ॥ Here the ऊ substitution is <i>Bahiranga</i>, and दि + ऊ = द्यू, the change of इ into य is <i>antaranga</i>, therefore on the maxim of असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे (a <i>bahiranga</i> is non-existent for the purposes of an <i>antaranga</i>); there should be no change of इ into य, for ऊ is non-existent. That maxim is however set aside by नाजानन्तर्ये बहिष्ट्व प्रक्लृप्तिः "A <i>bahiranga</i> operation is not regarded as <i>bahiranga</i>, and consequently <i>asiddha</i>, when an <i>antaranga</i> operation is to take effect, which depends on the immediate sequence of a vowel and something else".

So also before a <i>jhaladi</i> affix; as प्रच्छ + क्त = पृष्टः, पृष्टवान् (क्तवतु), पृष्ट्वा (क्त्वा); here च्छ is changed to श, there is vocalisation by [[6.1.16]], and श changed to ष by [[8.2.36]].

So also व is changed to ऊ as, द्यूतः, द्यूतवान्, द्यूत्वा ॥

When the affixes are not ङित् or कित्, the rule does not apply: as द्युभ्याम्, द्युभिः ॥ Some do not read the <i>anuvritti</i> of कित् and ङित् into this <i>sutra</i>, and explain द्युभ्याम् and द्युभिः by [[6.1.131]] : उ short being substituted for व of दिव् ॥

In "छशां ष" [[8.2.36]] the letter छ should not be taken, because by the force of the present <i>sutra</i>, श is ordained to come every where in the place of छ ॥

The indicatory ठ् in ऊठ् is for the sake of distinguishing this ऊ in <i>sutras</i> like एत्ये धत्यूठ् सु [[6.1.89]]. In the <i>sutra</i> वाह ऊंठ् [[6.4.132]] there is also indicatory ठ् ॥
