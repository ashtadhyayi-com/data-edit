Thus from स्रन्स् and ध्वन्स् are formed स्रस्तः and ध्वस्तः with क्त, स्रस्यते, ध्वस्यते with यक्, सनीस्रस्यते, दनीध्वस्यते with यङ् the नी being added by [[7.4.84]]. But नन्द्यते and नानन्द्यते, then न् is not elided, the root being written in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as टुणदि समृद्धौ, and न being added by [[7.1.58]]. Why do we say ending in a consonant? Observe नीयते, नेनीयते from नी which has a penultimate nasal, but ends in a vowel. Why do we say 'penultimate'? Observe नह्यते, नानह्यते ॥ Why do we say having an indicatory क or ङ? Observe स्रंसनं, ध्वंसनं with ल्युट् ॥

Vart:- The roots लङ्ग (लगि) and कम्प् (कपि) are exceptions, where meaning 'to feel pain or difficulty' and 'a disease of the body'. These, though exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with an indicatory इ, are treated as exceptions to the rule of अनिदित् : thus विलगितः and विकपितः, when not having the above meanings, we have विलङ्कितं and विकम्पितं ॥

Vart:- The causative of the root रञ्ज, loses its nasal when meaning 'to hunt deer' : as, रजयति मृगान् 'he hunts the deer', but रञ्जयति वस्त्राणि 'he colors the clothes'.

Vart:- रञ्ज loses its nasal before the affix घिनुण्, as रागी ॥

Vart:- The words रजकः, रजनम्, and रजः are formed from रञ्ज by the elision of the nasal.
