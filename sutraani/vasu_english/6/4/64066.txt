For the final of the roots of the form of दा and घा (घु), as well as for that of the roots 1. मा 2. स्था 3. गा 4. पा 5. हा (जुहाति) and 6. सा (सो), there is substituted ई before an आर्धधातुक affix beginning with a consonant which has an indicatory क् or ङ्।
Thus दीयते, धीयते with यक्, देदीयते, वेघीयते with यङ् ॥ So also मीयते मेमीयते स्थीयते, तेष्ठीयते, गीयते, जेगीयते, अध्यगीष्ट, अध्यगीषाताम्, अध्यगीषत, पीयते, पेपीयते, हीयते, जेहीयते, अवसीयते, अवसेसीयते ॥

The पा 'to protect' of <i>Adadi</i> (47) is not meant here. become the <i>vikarana</i> शप् is elided in roots of that class. Its form will be पायते. It is <i>Bhvadi</i> पा 'to drink' that is taken here. So also हा — जिहीयते is not to be taken here. Its form is हायते ॥

Why do we say 'before a consonant'? Observe ददतुः, ददुः ॥ Here had हल् not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, the आ of दा would be replaced by ई by the present <i>sutra</i>, even before a vowel-affix अतु ० उस् ; for the <i>lopa</i> of आ taught in [[6.4.64]] is prevented by this subsequent <i>sutra</i>  teaching ई substitution. In fact, the employment of the word हल् in the aphorism is a <i>jnapaka</i> that the rule of <i>vipratishedha</i> (1. 4. 2) applies in this section of <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]], and the <i>lopa</i> of आ is superseded by the present rule substituting ई instead. So also दाता and धाता before non-कित् and non ङित् affixes.
