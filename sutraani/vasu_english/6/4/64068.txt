The स्था was the only root of [[6.4.66]], which could have been affected by this rule. It has been, however, specially exempted by the word अन्यस्य ॥ Thus ग्लेयात् or ग्लायात्, म्लेयात् or म्लायात्, but only स्थेयात् [[6.4.66]], and यायात् (not commencing with a double consonant). The phrase क्ङिति is understood here and therefore the rule applies to <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes [[3.4.104]]. Thus ग्लासिष्ट in <i>Atmanepada</i>. The root considered as an <i>anga</i>, should consist of a double consonant, therefore in निर्वायात् (from निर् + वा), र्व is not to be considered as a root having a double consonant, for र is no part of the <i>anga</i>, but of the preposition.
