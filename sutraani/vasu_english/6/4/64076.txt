रे is diversely substituted for इरे in the छन्दस् (Vedas).
Thus कं स्विद्गर्भं प्रथमं दध्रे आपः (<i>Rig</i> X. 82. 5) या स्य परिदध्रे ॥ In दध्रे, the आ of धा is elided before the affix इरे by [[6.4.64]], the रे substitution being considered as <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]] for the purposes of the elision of आ ॥ Sometimes the substitution does not take place, as परमाया धियोग्निर्म्माणि चक्रिरे ॥ Here इट् augment is first added to रे after the सेट् roots and the affix thus becomes इरे, then रे is substituted again for this इरे by this <i>sutra</i>, thus the affix is brought back to its original condition. To show this repetition — रे — इरे — रे the <i>sutra</i> has exhibited the word इरयोः in the dual number.
