As श्रुधी हविमिन्द्र, शृणुधी, गिरः, पूर्धि, उरुकृदुरुणस्कृ and अवावृधि, ॥

In शृणुधी, the हि is not elided after the उ of  णु as it was required by [[6.4.106]], since the present aphorism specifically mentions it. The lengthening takes place by [[6.3.137]]. The forms other than शृणुधि are irregular; शप् being added diversely by [[3.1.85]], and then elided diversely by बहुलं छन्दसि [[2.4.73]]
