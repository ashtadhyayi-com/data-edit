The personal endings are elided after चिण् , the 3rd person singular Passive of Aorist.
As अहारि, अलावि, अकारि, अपाचि ॥ So also अकारितराम्, अहारितमाम्, here the elision of the personal affix त (III. I. 60) of the Aorist being considered as <i>asiddha</i>, the affixes तरप् and तमप् are not elided: though if the <i>sutra</i> were to be literally interpreted, every affix after चिण्, ought to be elided. Or the word क्ङिति is understood here; so that कित् and ङित् affixes of चिण् are elided and not every affix.
