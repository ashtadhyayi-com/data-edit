Thus कृ + उ + तस् = कर् + उ + तस् [[7.3.84]] = कुर् + उ + तस् = कुरुतः [[6.4.110]] The तस् is ङित् by [[1.2.4]]. So also कुर्वन्ति, कुरु ॥ Why do we say 'before a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i>'? So that the rule may apply to what was once a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i>, though no longer existent. Thus कुरु where the personal ending हि is elided, but it leaves its effect behind. The त् in उत् shows that this उ is not to be gunated by [[7.3.86]]. When the affix is not कित् or ङित् we have करोति, करोषि and करोमि [[1.2.4]].
