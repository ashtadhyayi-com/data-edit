Thus पेचिथ, शेकिथ ॥ But पपक्थ before <i>anit</i> थ; दिदेविथ, the vowel being इ and not अ; ततक्षिथ, ररक्षिथ, the अ not standing between two simple consonants; and चकणिथ, बभणिथ, the reduplicate having the substitutes च and ब different from क and  भ ॥ This <i>sutra</i> applies even when the affix is not कित्; and थल् is read in the <i>sutra</i> only for the sake of clearness, no non-<i>kit</i> Perfect ending can take इट् except थल् ॥
