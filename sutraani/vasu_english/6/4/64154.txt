The affix तृ is elided before the affixes 1. इष्ठन् 2. इमनिव् and 3. ईयसुन्।
Thus करिष्ठः, विजयिष्ठः, वहिष्ठः, दोहीयसी धेनुः ॥ The whole affix तृ is elided; otherwise only the last vowel (टि) with the following consonant would have been elided by the following rules. The <i>anuvritti</i> of लुक् of the last aphorism should not be read into this, for had the elision taken place by लुक्, then the mark of the affix would also have disappeared likewise (I. 1. 63.), and there would have remained no <i>guna</i> in विजयिष्ठ and करिष्ठ ॥ See (V. I. 122), and [[5.3.59]]; for these affixes. The affix इमन् has been read into this aphorism for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, there being no example of तृ followed by इमन्; तृ is followed by इष्ठ and ईयस् by [[5.3.59]].
