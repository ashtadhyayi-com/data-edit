The both are collectively called अभ्यस्त।
Though the word द्वे was understood in the <i>sutra</i>, the use of the word उभे 'both' indicates that the word <i>Abhyasta</i> applies to the two taken together and not to any one of them separately. The word <i>abhyasta</i> occurs in <i>sutras</i> [[3.4.109]], [[6.1.32]] &c. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[6.1.189]] declares "the first vowel of an <i>Abhyasta</i> gets the <i>udatta</i> accent". The <i>Abhyasta</i> being the collective name of the both, the accent will fall on the first and not on the second, as in ददति <i>dadati</i>, the accent is on the first अ ॥ So also by [[7.1.4]] अत् takes the place of झ after an <i>Abhyasta</i>, therefore, दद + झि = दद + अति = ददति ॥ So also ददत् [[6.4.112]].
