Of a non-reduplicate root there is reduplication when the विकरण श्लु follows.
The श्लु is the characteristic sign of the roots of the third class, and causes the elision of the <i>vikarana</i> शप् ॥ The reduplication is of the first or second syllable, according as the root has an initial consonant or a vowel. Thus जुहोति (from हु), बिभेति, जिह्रेति ॥
