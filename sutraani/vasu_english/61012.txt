The participles दाश्वाम् , साह्वान् , and मीढ्वान् are irregularly formed without reduplication.
The word दाश्वान् is from the root दाशृ 'to give' with the affix क्वसु [[3.2.107]], here the reduplication and the augment इट् are prohibited irregularly. As दाश्वांसो दाशुषः सुतम् (<i>Rig</i> I.3.7). The word साह्वान् is derived from the root सह् 'to endure', by adding the affix क्वसु [[3.2.107]], the irregularity being in lengthening the penultimate, not allowing the augment इट् and the reduplication. Thus साह्वान् बलाहकः ॥ So also मीढ्वान् comes from मिढ् 'to sprinkle' with the affix क्वसु [[3.2.107]] the irregularity consisting in non-reduplication, non-application of इट्, the lenghthening of the penultimate vowel, and the change of ह into ड ॥ As मीड्वस्तोकाय तनयाय मृडय ॥ It is not necessary that these words should be in the singular always, in their plural forms also they do not reduplicate.

Vart:- Reduplication takes place when कृञ् &c, are followed by the affix क ॥ Thus क्रियते अनेन = कृ + क = चक्रम्, क्लिद् + क = चिक्लिदम् ॥ The affix क comes after कृञ् and क्लिद् with the force of the affix घञ् ॥

Vart:- The roots चर्, चल्, पत्, and वद् take reduplication when followed by the affix अच् [[3.1.134]] and the reduplicate (<i>abhyasa</i>) takes the augment आक् ॥ The final consonants of the <i>Abhyasa</i> (reduplicate) are not elided in these verbs, in order to give scope to the augment, for if the final consonants be elided by [[7.4.60]], then the addition of the augment becomes unnecessary; as there is no difference between the augment and the <i>adesa</i> (shortening of the vowel) taught in [[7.4.59]]. Thus चराचरः, चलाचल, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥

Vart:- The above <i>vartika</i> is optional, so we have the forms चरः पुरुषः, चलो रथः, वदो मनुष्यः &c.

Vart:- The root हन् is reduplicated before the affix अच्, and the augment आक् comes after the <i>Abhyasa</i>, and घ is the substitute of ह of the <i>Abhyasa</i>. Thus हन् + अच् = घन् + आक् + हन् + अच् = घनाघनः (The second ह is changed into घ by [[7.3.55]]), as in the phrase घनाघनः क्षोभनश्चर्षणीनाम् ॥

Vart:- The causative root पाटि is reduplicated before the affix अच्, there is elision of णि (sign of the causative), and उक् is the augment of the <i>Abhyasa</i>, and it is lengthened. Thus पाटि + च् = पाटूपटः ॥
