There is vocalisation of the semi-vowel य् of the affix ष्यङ् [[4.1.78]] when followed in a तत्-पुरुष compound, by the words पुत्र and पति।
When the words पुत्र and पति are the second members; forming a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound, there is <i>samprasarana</i> (vocalising the semi-vowels) of the affix ष्यङ् of the preceding. That is य् is changed into इ ॥ Thus करीषस्येव गन्धोऽस्य = करीषगन्धिः (a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound taking the <i>samasanta</i> affix or rather substitute इ by [[5.4.137]] करीषगन्धैरपत्यम् = करीषगन्धि + अण् [[4.1.92]] = करीषगन्धः ॥ The feminine of this will be formed by adding ष्यङ् [[4.1.78]]. Thus we have कारीषगन्ध्या (see [[4.1.78]]). Now in forming the <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound of this word with पुत्र or पति, the final य् will be changed into इ and we have कारीषगन्धीपुत्रः, कारीषगन्धीपतिः ॥ The आ of या becomes merged into इ [[6.1.108]], and the short इ is lengthened [[6.3.139]]. So also कौमुदगन्धीपुत्रः or कौमुदगन्धीपतिः ॥

Why do we say "of the affix ष्यङ्"? Observe इभ्यापुत्रः, क्षत्रियापुत्रः ॥

Why do we say "when followed by पुत्र or पति"? Observe कारीषगन्ध्याकुलम्, कौमुदगन्ध्याकुलम् ॥

Why do we say "when forming a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound"? Observe कारीषगन्ध्यापतिरस्य ग्रामस्य = कारीषगन्ध्यापतिरयं ग्रामः ॥ It is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound.

The affix ष्यङ् is here the feminine affix य followed by चाप् (आ) (see [[4.1.77]] and [[4.1.74]].

A general maxim relating to all affixes is "an affix denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added, and ends with the affix itself: प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहितस्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम्"॥ This maxim, however, does not apply in case of feminine affixes, where we have this rule "a feminine affix denotes whenever it is employed in a rule, a word-form which ends with that affix, but which need not necessarily begin with that to which the affix has been added, but where the word form is subordinate: "स्त्रीप्रत्यये चानुपसर्जने न"॥ Thus we have परमकारीषगन्ध्यायाः पुत्रः =  परमकारीषगन्धीपुत्रः and so also परमकारीषगन्धीपतिः ॥ Not so when the word is an <i>upasarjana</i> or subordinate in a compound. As अतिक्रान्ता कारीषगन्ध्याम् = अतिकारीषगन्ध्या, तस्य पुत्रः = अतिकारीषगन्ध्यापुत्रः, अतिकारीषगन्ध्यापतिः ॥

This vocalisation takes place when पुत्र and पति alone, not compounded with any other word, stand at the end : not so when a word beginning or ending with these words follows. Thus कारीषगन्ध्यापुत्रकुलं, कारीषगन्ध्यापरमपुत्रः &c.

Though a word ending in ष्यङ् may have many semi-vowels, yet the vocalisation takes place of the affix य (ष्यङ्) only, according to the maxim निर्दिश्यमानस्यादेशा भवन्ति "substitutes take the place of that which is actually enunciated".

The word संप्रसारण has regulating influence upto [[6.1.44]] inclusive. The rules of vocalisation (change of semi-vowels into vowels) is contained in these <i>sutras</i>.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated when पति and पुत्र follow the word गौकाक्ष्य ॥ As गौकाक्ष्यापुत्रः, गौकाक्ष्यायातः instead of गौकाक्षीपुत्रः &c.
