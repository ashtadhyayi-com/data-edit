There is vocalisation of the semi-vowels of the following verbs, when an affix having an indicatory क् or ङ् follows - ग्रह 'to take', ज्या 'to become old', वेञ् 'to weave', व्यध 'to strike', वश 'to shine', व्यच 'to deceive', व्रश्च 'to cut', प्रच्छ 'to ask' and भ्रस्ज 'to cook, to fry'.
By force of the word 'च' 'and', the <i>anuvritti</i> of किति is read into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus 1. ग्रह — गृहीतः, गृहीतवान् (by क्त and क्तवतु), गृह्णाति (1.2. 4), जरीगृह्यते (by यङ of the Intensive). 2. ज्या - जीनः, जीनवान् [[8.2.44]] त changed to न), जिनाति (1.2. 4), the short इ is lengthened by [[6.4.2]] and is shortened again by [[7.3.80]]. जेजीयते (यङ्), 3. वयि - The root वेञ् is replaced by वय when लिट् follows [[2.4.41]]. This वयि can have no ङित् affix after it, it takes only लिट् terminations, which as we know are कित् [[1.2.5]]. The examples, therefore given will be of कित् affixes only. Thus ऊयतुः, ऊयतुः ॥ Now arises this question 'why do you enumerate वयि, for is not वेञ् (for which वयि is substituted) already included in यजादि class of verbs given in the last <i>sutra</i>, and by force of that <i>sutra</i>, वयि will get <i>samprasarana</i> before कित् affixes". The reply is "वयि is numerated here in order to show that the prohibition of <i>samprasarana</i> with regard to वेञ् as taught in [[6.1.40]], does not apply to its substitute वयि in the Perfect Tense". Thus while the Perfect of वेञ् is ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः, the Perfect of its substitute वयि is ऊवाय, ऊयतुः and ऊयुः ॥ More over [[6.1.38]] teaches that the य of वय is not vocalised in लिट् affixes, which therefore, implies <i>jnapaka</i>) that the other semivowel i. e. व of वय will be vocalised. 4. व्यध - विद्धः, विद्धवान्, and with ङित् affixes विध्यति, वेविध्यते ॥ 5. वश - उशितः, उशितवान्, and with ङित् affixes उष्टः, उशन्ति ॥ 6. व्यचः - विचितः, विचितवान् विचति, वेविच्यते ॥ By a <i>Vartika</i> under [[1.2.1]], the word व्यच is considered to belong to कुटादि class, and therefore all affixes after it, other than those having an indicatory ण्, ञ् or the affix अस्, are considered as ङित्, and therefore, there will be <i>samprasarana</i> before these affixes : as, उद्विचिता, उद्विचितुम्, उद्विचितव्यम् ॥ 7. वृश्च — वृकणः, वृकणवान् ॥ How is the final च् of व्रश्च changed into क्, for by [[8.2.36]] च ought to have been changed into ष before the झलादि affix क्त ? To this we reply the affix क्त is replaced by न [[7.2.42]] and as this न is not a झलादि affix, Rule [[8.2.36]] does not apply. This is done on the following maxim: "The substitute of the <i>Nishtha</i> should be considered to be <i>siddha</i> or effective when applying the rules relating to the change of a letter into ष, to accent, to affix, and to the addition of the augment इट्". But when च is to be changed into क, the substitute is considered <i>asiddha</i> (not to have taken place). Thus we have the forms वृकणः &c. Before ङित् affixes we have वृश्चति, वरीवृश्च्यते ॥ 8. प्रच्छ - पृष्टः [[8.2.36]], पृष्टवान्, ङित् -पृच्छति, परीपृच्छ्यते ॥ The forms पप्रच्छ and बभ्रञ्ज would have been evolved by the simple rules of Reduplication even, without the application of this rule. But प्रच्छ+ नङ् [[3.3.90]] प्रश्नः ॥ Here there is no vocalisation, because <i>Panini</i> himself uses the word प्रश्नः in <i>sutra</i> [[3.2.117]] showing that this is the proper form though irregular. 9. भ्रस्ज - भृष्टः [[7.2.36]], भृष्टवान्, ङित् — भृञ्जति, बरीभृञ्ज्यते ॥ The स of भ्रस्ज is changed first into द by झलां जश् झशि [[8.4.53]], and then द is changed into ज by स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः [[8.4.40]].
