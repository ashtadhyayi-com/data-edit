There is vocalisation of the semi-vowel, of the verbs स्वप् 'to sleep', स्यम् 'to shout' and व्ये 'to cover', when followed by the affix यङ् of the Intensive.
Thus सोषुप्यते, सेसिम्यते, वेवीयते [[7.4.25]] the short इ is lengthened). Why do we say 'when यङ् follows'? Observe स्वप्नक् formed by नजिङ् [[3.2.172]].
