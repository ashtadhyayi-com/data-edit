There is vocalisation of the semi-vowel of the root श्या (श्यै) 'to go' when the निष्ठा affix follows, when the sense is 'coagulation' or 'cold to touch'.
The word द्रवमूर्त्ति means hardening of a fluid, by coagulation &c. Thus शीनं घृतं, शीना वसा, शीनं मेदः "a coagulated butter, grease &c". The त of <i>nishtha</i> is changed to न by [[8.2.47]]. But when the sense is that of 'cold', the त is not changed; as शीतं वर्त्तते, शीतो वायुः, शीतमुदकम् ॥ The word शीत is here used both as a noun meaning 'cold weather &c', and an adjective denoting 'cold'. There is no vocalisation when the sense is not that of 'coagulation' or 'cold', as संश्यानो वृश्चिकः 'the rolled up scorpion'. The short इ is lengthened in शीन &c, by [[6.4.2]].
