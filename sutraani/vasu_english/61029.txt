There is substitution of पी for प्याय् when the affixes of the Perfect (लिट्) and the Intensive (यङ्) follow.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word विभाषा ceases. The phrase प्यायः पी of the last <i>sutra</i> is drawn into this by force of the word च  'and'; thus आपिप्ये, आपिप्याते, आपिप्यिरे ॥

The substitution of पी a subsequent rule, would have debarred reduplication which precedes it in order. The reduplication, however, takes place after the substitution, by force of the maxim of पुनः प्रसङ्ग &c mentioned in [[6.1.17]]. Thus पी + लिट् = पि + पी + त = पि + प्य + ए [[6.4.82]] the य being substituted) = आपिप्ये with the affix आ. So also in the Intensive, as, आपेपीयते, आपेपीयेते, आपेपीयन्ते ॥
