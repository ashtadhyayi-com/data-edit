There is optionally the vocalisation of the semi-vowel श्वि before the affixes of the Perfect and the Intensive.
The phrases लिड् यङोः and सम्प्रसारणं are to be read Into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus शुशावे or शिश्वाय, शुशुवतुः or शिश्वियतुः ॥ So also in the Intensive as शीशृयते or शश्वीयते ॥ The root श्वि would not have taken vocalisation before यङ् by any previous rule, this <i>sutra</i> teaches optional vocalisation. The root would have taken vocalisation before लिट्, which is a कित् affix, invariably by [[6.1.15]], this <i>sutra</i> modifies that by making the substitution optional. In the alternative, when the root does become vocalised, the reduplicate is also not vocalised in spite of [[6.1.17]]. This explains the form शिश्वाय, which by [[6.1.17]] would have been शुश्वाय ॥ श्वि + णल् = (श् उद्व + णल् [[6.1.30]]) = शु + णल् [[6.1.108]] = शु + शु + अ [[6.1.8]] = शुशाव ॥
