There is the vocalisation of the semi-vowel of the causative of ह्वे before the Desiderative and the Reduplicated Aorist affixes.
The whole of the last <i>sutra</i> is to be read into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus जुहावयिषति and जुहावयिषतः; जुहावयिषन्ति; अजूहवत्, अजूहवताम् and अजूहवन् ॥ The root ह्वा does not take the augment य required by [[7.3.37]] before the affix णि, because the <i>Samprasarana</i> rule is stronger. The repetition of the word संप्रसारण in this <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was present, indicates that the force of the word विभाषा has ceased. Though this and the next <i>sutra</i> could well have been made one, their separation shows that the <i>samprasarana</i> does not take place when another affix, not causing reduplication, intervenes. As ह्वायकमिच्छति = ह्वायकीयति; the Desiderative of this verb is जिह्वायकीयिषति ॥
