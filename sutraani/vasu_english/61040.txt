The semi-vowel of वे 'to weave' is not vocalised in the Perfect.
Thus ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः ॥ This root belongs to यजादि class and would have been vocalised before कित् affixes by [[6.1.15]]; and before non-कित् affixes the Reduplicate syllable of the Perfect would have been vocalised by [[6.1.17]]. Both vocalisations are prohibited here.
