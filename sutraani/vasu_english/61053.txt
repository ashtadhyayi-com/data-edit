There is optionally the substitution of आ in the room of the diphthong of the root गुर् 'to exert' when preceded by the preposition अप and taking the affix णमुल्।
The affix णमुल् forming the Absolutive Participle is added by [[3.4.22]], and the word formed by it is repeated. Thus अपगारमपगारम् or अपगोरमपगोरम् ॥ So also this affix is added by [[3.4.53]]: as, अस्यपगारं युध्यन्ते or अस्यपगोरं युध्यन्ते 'they are fighting with raised swords'.
