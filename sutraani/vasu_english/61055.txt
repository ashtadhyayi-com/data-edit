There is optionally the substitution of आ in the room of the diphthong of the root वी in the causative, when meaning 'to conceive an embryo'.
The root वी <i>Adadi</i> 39 means 'to go, to conceive, to shine, to eat, and to desire'. The substitution takes place when it means 'to impregnate or conceive'. Thus पुरो वानो गाः प्रवापयति or प्रवाययति = गर्भे ग्राहयति ॥ The word प्रजन means the receiving of the embryo which in course of time will lead to the birth of a child.
