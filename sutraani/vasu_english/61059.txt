The augment अम् (अ) augment comes optionally after the ऋ of those roots which are exhibited in the धातुपाठ as अनुदात्त , when such roots end in a consonant having a ऋ has penultimate and are followed by an affix beginning with a mute or sibilant and not having an indicatory क।
The word उपदेश is understood here, so also झल्यमकिति ॥ Thus त्रप्ता or तर्पिता or तर्प्ता or द्रप्ता, दर्पिता or दर्प्ता ॥ The roots तृप 'to satisfy', and दृप् 'to be happy to release', belong to <i>Divadi</i> class, sub-class <i>Radhadi</i>, and they take the augment इट् optionally [[7.2.45]], so we have the three forms given above : for these roots are also <i>anudatta</i> in their first enunciation.

Why do we say "which are <i>anudatta</i> in the <i>Upadesa</i> or the system of grammatical instruction"? Observe वर्ढा, वर्ढुम्, वर्ढव्यम्, from वृहू उद्यमने which is exhibited as उदात्त, and because it has an indicatory ऊ it takes इट् optionally. Why do we say 'having a penultimate ॠ letter'? Observe भेत्ता, छेत्ता ॥ Why do we say 'before an affix beginning with a mute or a sibilant'? Observe तर्पणम्, दर्पणम् ॥ Why do we say 'not having an indicatory क'? Observe तृप्तः, दृप्तः ॥ Before affixes not beginning with a झल् consonant this augment will not be inserted, as तर्पणम्, दर्पणम् ॥
