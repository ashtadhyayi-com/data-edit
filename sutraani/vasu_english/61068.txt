After a consonant there is the elision of the nominative affix स् and the tense-affix ति and सि (when reduced to the form of त् and स् ) being consonants; and so also after the long vowels ई and आ of the feminine (affix ङी and आप् ), there is the elision of the nominative affix स्।
The <i>sutra</i> translated literally means :- After a word ending in a consonant, or ङी, or आप् when a long vowel, the affixes सु, ति and सि when reduced to a single consonant affix (अपृक्तं हल्) are elided. But ति and सि are elided only after a consonant and hence we have translated it as above. As examples of the elision of सु after a consonant:- राजन् + स् = राजान् [[6.4.8]] + ० = राजा, तक्षा, उखास्रत्, पर्णध्वत् ॥ After a ङी :- कुमारी, गौरी, शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ After आप् :- खट्वा, बहुराजा, कारीषगन्धा ॥ The elision of ति and सि takes place only after consonants :-as, अबिभर्भवान् (भृ + लङ् + तिप् = अ + भृ + श्लु + त् = अ + भृ + भृ + त् [[6.1.10]] = अ + भर् + भृ + त् [[7.4.66]] and [[1.1.51]] = अ + बि + भर् + त् [[7.4.60]] = अ + ब + भृ + त् [[8.4.54]] = अ + बि + भृ + त् [[7.4.76]] = अ + बि + भर् + त् [[7.3.84]] = अबिभर् + त् = अबिभर् ॥ So also अजागर् भवान् ॥ In both these cases त् of the Imperfect has been elided. The स् is elided in the following:- अभिनोऽत्र, अच्छिनोऽत्र  ॥ (भिद् + लङ् + सिप् ॥ The द् is changed into र् by [[8.2.75]] and स् is elided by this rule).

Why do we say "after a consonant, or a feminine affix ई and आ"? Observe ग्रामणीः, सेनानीः ॥ Why do we say "after a long vowelled feminine affix"? Observe निष्कौशाम्बिः, अतिखट्वः, where the feminine affixes have been shortened. Why do we say "when followed by सु, ति and सि"? Observe अभैत्सीत् ॥ The सि being read along with ति, does not include सिच्, but refers to सिप् only. Why do we say 'when reduced to a single letter'? Observe भिनत्ति, छिनत्ति ॥ Why do we say 'the consonant is elided'? Observe बिभेद, चिच्छेद ॥ Here the <i>aprikta</i> affix अ of the Perfect is not elided : though it being the substitute of ति is like ति, and ought to have been elided, had the word हल् not been used in the <i>sutra</i>.

Why has the elision of स् (सु), त् (तिप्) and स् (सिप्) been ordained after consonants, as they would of themselves have been dropped by [[8.2.23]], being the finals of a compound consonant? Then the forms राजा, तक्षा could not be evolved. As राजन् + स् = राजान् + स् [[6.4.8]] = राजान्स् and by eliding स् by Rule [[8.2.23]], the form would have become राजान्, and the final न् could not have been elided by [[8.2.7]]; for it is a maxim enunciated in the very opening of the Second chapter of the 8th Book, that in the last three chapters of that Book (2nd, 3rd and 4th Books), a subsequent rule is as if it had not taken effect, so far as any preceding rule is concerned; therefore, the rule [[8.2.7]] ordaining the elision of न्, does not find scope, since [[8.2.23]] (ordaining elision of स्) is considered as if it had not taken effect. So also in the case of उखास्रत् and पर्णध्वत् ॥ उखा + स्रन्ग् + क्विप् [[3.2.76]] = उखा + स्रस् (the nasal being elided by [[6.4.24]]); now add सु, we have उखास्रस् + स् = उखास्रस्स; elide the final स् not by this rule, but by [[8.2.23]], we have उखास्रस्, here we cannot change the स् into द् by [[8.2.72]] for स् is not final in a <i>pada</i>, for Rule [[8.2.23]] is considered as not to have taken effect. So also in the case of अभिनोऽत्र ॥ The word अभिनः is 2nd. Person singular of the Imperfect of भिद् of <i>Rudhadi</i> class. Thus भिद् + लङ् + सिप् = अ + भिद् + श्नम् + स् = अ + भिनद् + स् = अभिनर् + स् (द changed to र् by [[8.2.75]]) = अभिनर्स् ॥ If we elide the final स् of the conjunct by [[8.2.23]], then in अभिनर् + अत्र, the र् would not be changed into उ to form अभिनोऽत्र by [[6.1.113]] since the elision of स् is considered as to have not taken effect when applying this rule. So also in अबिभर् भवान्, by Rule [[8.2.24]], there would be no <i>lopa</i> even, for संयोगान्तलोप rule is restricted by रात्सस्य [[8.2.24]], i. e. स्  only and no other consonant is elided after र्, therefore there will be no elision of त् in अबिभर्त् by [[8.2.23]].
