The consonant of the nominative-affix (सु and its substitute अम् ) is elided in the Vocative singular after a nominal-stem ending in ए or ओ or a short vowel.
The word लोप is understood here also; as well as हल् ॥ The word अपृक्त however is not to be read here, as its repetition in [[6.1.68]] (though its <i>anuvritti</i> was there from the preceding <i>sutra</i>) indicates. The affix of Vocative is the same as that of the nominative. By [[7.3.108]], the short vowel of the stem is replaced by a <i>guna</i> vowel when the Vocative Singular affix follows. Thus we have अग्ने and वायो for अग्नि and वायु; and by [[7.3.107]], a short vowel is substituted for the long vowel ई and ऊ of the feminine: as नदि and वधु for नदी and वधू ॥ Now applying the present <i>sutra</i>, the affix स् is elided after all the above words. As हे अग्ने !, हे वायो !, हे देवदत्त !, हे नदि !, हे वधु ! The Vocative Singular of कुण्ड a Neuter noun is thus formed. By [[7.1.24]], अम् replaces स् of the nominative, the अ of अम् and the final अ of कुण्ड coalesce into one अ by [[6.1.107]], which becomes कुण्डम् ॥ Here by the rule that 'consonant' only is to be elided, we elide म् only (and not अ which becomes a part of the word by [[6.1.85]], for it is considered both as the final of the word and the initial of the affix). Now म् is not an अपृक्तं हल् for it is part of the affix अम्, and its elision would not have taken place had we read the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>aprikta</i> into this <i>sutra</i>. Thus we have हे कुण्ड ! ॥ But in हे कतरत् ! there is not the elision of the त् of the affix अत्, the substitute of सु for the affix there is अद्ड् [[7.1.25]]. This affix being डित् causes the elision of the final अ of कतर [[6.4.143]], and we have कतर् + अत्, here we have not a <i>pratipadika</i> which ends in a short vowel, but in a consonant hence त् is not elided. See also [[7.1.25]]. The word एङ् is used in the <i>sutra</i> in order to indicate that the <i>guna</i> substitution is stronger than <i>lopa</i>. Therefore in हे अग्नि + सु, the affix is not elided first and then <i>guna</i> substituted for इ, but first there is <i>guna</i> substitution and then the affix is elided.
