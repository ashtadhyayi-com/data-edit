To a root ending in a short vowel is added the augment त् (तुक्) when a कृत्-affix having an indicatory प् follows.
Thus अग्नि + चि + क्विप् = अग्निचित्, so also सोमसुत् ॥ Similarly प्रकृत्य and प्रहृत्य and उपस्तुत्य formed by the affix ल्यप् ॥ Why do we say "ending in a short vowel"? Observe आलूय, ग्रामणीः ॥ Why do we say "having an indicatory प"? Observe कूतम्, हृतम् ॥ Why do we say "a <i>krit</i> affix"? Observe पटुतरः, पटुतमः, with the <i>Taddhita</i>-affixes तरप् and तमप् ॥ In the compound ग्रामणिकुलम्, though the root is made short, yet there is no augment तुक्, in as much as the rule by which the root has been shortened is a <i>Bahiranga</i> rule, and the present rule is an <i>Antaranga</i> one. The maxim is असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे ॥ "That which is <i>Bahiranga</i> is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is <i>Antaranga</i> is to take effect".
