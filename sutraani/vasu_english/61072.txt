In the following sutras up to [[6.1.157]] inclusive, the words संहितायाम् 'in an unbroken flow of speech', should be supplied.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> or governing <i>sutra</i>, exerting its influence upto [[6.1.158]]. What ever we shall say in the <i>sutras</i> preceding that, must be understood to apply to words which are in संहिता, that is, which are pronounced together with an uninterrupted voice. Thus दध्यत्र, मध्वत्र the इ and उ are changed to य and व when the two words are pronounced without any hiatus. Otherwise we shall have दधि अत्र, मधु अत्र ॥
