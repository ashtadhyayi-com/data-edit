The augment त् is added to a preceding short vowel also when छ follows an in an uninterrupted speech.
Thus इच्छति, गच्छति ॥ The त is change to च by [[8.4.40]]. The short vowel itself is the आगमी (the thing to which the augment is added), and not the word ending in that short vowel. Therefore in चिच्छिदतुः, चिच्छिदुः, the augment is not to be considered as part of the Reduplicate चि, but of the short इ only; and therefore it is not elided by हलादिः शेष [[7.4.60]] rule applying to reduplicates. This follows on the maxim नावयवावयवः समुदायावयवो भवति "the part of a part cannot be considered as a part of the whole". Here त् is a part of the <i>abhyasa</i> syllable चि which is itself a part of the verbal base, therefore त् is not considered as an <i>abhyasa</i>: or because त् being an augment of इ is considered as part of इ and not of चि of which इ is the part.
