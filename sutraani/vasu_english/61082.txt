In the क्रय्य there is substitution of अय् for ए when the sense is that of 'exposed or put out for sale, saleable'.
The word क्रय्य is derive from क्री 'to buy', with the affix यत्; the <i>guna</i> ए being changed to य ॥ The word तदर्थ means 'for the purpose of that' i.e., for the purpose of being bought. As क्रय्या गौः, क्रय्यः कम्बलः ॥  Why do we say 'when the sense is that of saleable'? Observe क्रेयं नो धान्यं न चास्ति क्रय्यम् "we want to purchase corn, but it is not put out for sale".
