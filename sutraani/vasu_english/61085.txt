And this single substitute is considered as the final of the preceding (form) and the initial of the succeeding (form).
The single substitute taught in the last, is considered in the light of the final of the preceding form and the initial of the succeeding. An <i>adesa</i> is like the <i>sthani</i>, but in an <i>ekadesa</i>, the <i>sthani</i> is indeterminate, or rather the <i>sthani</i> is the collection or the sum of the preceding and the succeeding. Hence the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>. The sense of this <i>atidesa</i> <i>sutra</i> is this: as the beginning and the end of a thing are both included in the thing itself, and therefore when the thing is mentioned, the beginning and the end are both taken; so is the case with this single substitute. Thus to the stem ब्रह्मबन्धु we add ऊ the feminine affix [[4.1.66]]; and now उ + ऊ = ऊ [[6.1.101]] i. e. ब्रह्मबन्धु + ऊ = ब्रह्मबन्धू ॥ Here ब्रह्मबन्धु is a Nominal-stem (प्रातिपदिक) and the affix ऊ is a non-<i>pratipadika</i>, and the single-substitute ऊ is considered as the final of the <i>pratipadika</i>. So that we can apply to the form ब्रह्मबन्धु the term <i>pratipadika</i> and by virtue of this designation we can add the case-endings to it by [[4.1.1]]. But for this rule, we could not have added the case-endings to it, because by virtue of the feminine affix ऊ the word would have rather ceased to be a <i>pratipadika</i> [[1.1.46]], because this feminine affix ऊ is not included in [[4.1.1]]. Similarly for the final non-case-ending अ of वृक्ष and the case-ending औ, there comes a single substitute औ by [[6.1.88]], this <i>ekadesa</i> औ is considered both as a non-case affix and a case affix, that is, as the initial of the affix औ, and the final of वृक्ष and thus the word वृक्षौ gets the designation of <i>Pada</i> [[1.4.14]] as it ends in the सुप् affix औ ॥

This अन्तादिवद्भाव does not apply in rules relating to letters i. e. to rules depending for their application on letters. Thus खट्व + आ = खट्वा ॥ Here the <i>ekadesa</i> आ is as the final अ of खट्व, but not for the purposes of the application of the rule which says that the भिस् is changed to ऐस् after a nominal-stem ending in अ, so the Instrumental plural of खट्वा will not end in ऐः, but will be खट्वाभिः ॥ So also in जुहाव ॥ It is the Perfect 3rd person singular of ह्वे or ह्वा ( VI.1.45). By [[6.1.53]], the व् is changed to उ, and we have जुह्व्आ = जुह्उआ which by [[6.1.108]] becomes जुहु, the उ being the single substitute of उ and आ ॥ This single-substitute उ should not be considered as आ for the application of the rule [[7.1.34]] by which the Perfect affix णल् (अ) is changed in औ after roots ending in आ ॥ Similarly in अस्यै + अश्वः = अस्या अश्वः (the य् being elided by [[8.3.19]]). अस्यै is the Dative singular of इदम् in the Feminine with आ ॥ By [[7.3.114]] स्या is added in the Dative with the shortening of the preceding  आ; as अ + स्या + ए = अस्यै (Here ऐ is the single substitute for आ and ए ॥ Here for the application of [[6.1.109]] the single substitute ऐ should not be considered like ए ॥ The <i>sthani</i> of the single-substitute (<i>ekadesa</i>) is the sum of the preceding and the succeeding, both taken collectively is replaced by one, and not any one of them separately. For that which is replaced by another is called <i>sthani</i>: as when भू replaces अस् the whole form अस् is called <i>sthani</i>, and not अ or स् separately. The parts, may be called <i>sthani</i> only inferentially, because the whole is made up of parts. The parts not being considered as <i>sthani</i>, the rule of <i>sthanivad</i> <i>bhava</i> will not apply to an <i>ekadesa</i> with regards to the parts, and no operations dependant on such parts will be effected by such <i>ekadesa</i>. But it is intended that such operations should take place. Hence this <i>sutra</i>.
