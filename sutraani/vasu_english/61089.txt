The वृद्धि is the single substitute of अ or आ + ए of एति (root इ) and एधति (root एध), and for अ or आ + ऊ of उठ (the substitute of वा in वाह by [[6.4.132]]).
The whole of the last <i>sutra</i> and आत् are understood here. The एच् of the last <i>sutra</i> qualifies the root इ in एति, i. e. when the root इ assumes the form ए by internal changes, then apples this <i>Vriddhi</i> rule. The एच् does not qualify the root एध् as that root always has an initial diphthong, nor does एच् qualify ऊठ् for ऊ is not a diphthong. Thus उप + एति = उपैति, उप + एषि = उपैषि, उपैमि; उप + एधते = उपैधते, प्रैधते; प्रष्ठ + ऊहा = प्रष्ठौहा ॥ In the last example, <i>guna</i> was the substitute required by [[6.1.87]], the present <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>Vriddhi</i> instead. In the case of एति and एधति, the <i>Vriddhi</i> was debarred by [[6.1.94]]: this <i>sutra</i> makes an exception to that rule. The present <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[6.1.94]] and not to [[6.1.95]], because the maxim is पुरस्तादपवादा अनन्तरान् विधीन् बाधन्ते नोत्तरान् "<i>Apavadas</i> that precede the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the <i>apavada</i> operations, supersede only those rules that stand nearest to them, not the subsequent rules". Therefore the present rule does not apply here,:- उप + आ + इत = उप + एत = उपेतः (Here though इ is changed to ए, the rule does not apply). Therefore the form अवैहि is wrong. So also उप + इत = उपेतः for here the root इ has not assumed the form ए, therefore the rule does not apply, the word एचि qualifies the root इ ॥

Vart:- The <i>Vriddhi</i> is the single substitute when अक्ष is followed by ऊहिनी, as अक्षौहिणी सेना ॥

Vart:- The <i>Vriddhi</i> is the single substitute when स्व is followed by ईर or ईरिण, or ईरिणी thus स्वैरम्, स्वैरिणी ॥ The word ईर is formed by the affix घञ् added to ईर्गतौ (Ad. 8 स्वेनाभिप्रायेण ईरणं = स्वैरम् the compounding takes place by [[2.1.32]]. Another form is स्वैरी = स्वेनाभिप्रायेणेरते गच्छति with the affix णिनि [[3.2.78]].

Vart:- The <i>Vriddhi</i> is the single substitute when प्र is followed by ऊह, ऊढ, ऊढि, एष, एष्य; as प्रौहः, प्रौढः, प्रौढिः, प्रैषः, प्रैष्यः ॥ The word एष is derived from the root इषु 'to wish' (<i>Tudadi</i>. 59), इष् 'to go' (<i>Divadi</i>. 18), and इष् 'to repeat' (<i>Kryadi</i>. 53), by adding the affix घञ्; and the word एष्य is derived from the same roots by adding ण्यत् ॥ This <i>Vartika</i> ordains <i>Vriddhi</i>, while [[6.1.94]] would have caused पररूपः ॥ While the roots ईष् 'to glean', and ईष् 'to go' 'to injure', 'to show'. (<i>Bhvadi</i>. 115 and 642), form ईषः and ईष्यः with the above affixes; and with प्र, their forms will be प्रेषः and प्रेष्यः ॥

Vart:- The <i>Vriddhi</i> is the single substitute when a word ending in अ is followed by ऋत and forms an Instrumental Tatpurusha<i> compound: as सुखेन ऋतः = सुखार्तः, दुःखेन ऋतः = दुःखार्तः, but सुखेन इतः = सुखेतः ॥ Why in Instrumental? Observe परमर्तः ॥ Why 'Compound'? See सुखेनर्तः ॥

Vart:- The </i>Vriddhi<i> is the single substitute when the word ऋण follows the following:- प्र, वत्सतर, कम्बल, वसन ॥ As प्रार्णम् 'principal debt', वत्सतरार्णम् 'the debt of a steer', कम्बलार्णम् 'debt of a blanket', वसनार्णम् 'debt of a cloth'.

Vart:- So also when the words ऋण and दश are followed by ऋणः — as, ऋणार्णम् and दशार्णम् ॥ The word ऋणार्ण means a debt incurred to pay off a prior debt. The </i>Dasarna_ is the name of a river and of a country.
