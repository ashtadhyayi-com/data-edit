The वृद्धि is the single substitute when the अ or आ of a preposition (उपसर्ग) is followed by the short ऋ of a verb.
The word आत् is understood here also. When a preposition ending in अ or आ is followed by a root beginning with ऋ, the <i>Vriddhi</i> is the single substitute for the precedent अ or आ and the subsequent ऋ ॥ This debars the <i>guna</i> taught in [[6.1.87]]. Thus उप + ऋच्छति = उपार्च्छति, प्रार्च्छति, उपाध्रोति ॥ Why do we say 'after a preposition'? Observe खट्वर्च्छति, मालर्च्छति, प्रर्च्छकोदेशः = प्रगता ऋच्छका अस्माद् देशात् ॥ Here the word प्र is not treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, hence this <i>sutra</i> does not apply. It is a <i>Gati</i> here. Why do we say 'when ऋ follows'? Observe उप + इत = उपेतः ॥ Why have we used त् after ऋ indicating that short ऋ is to be taken? Observe उप + ऋकारी यति = उपर्कारीयति ॥ No option is allowed here by the subsequent <i>sutra</i>. The त् is used, in fact, for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i> in case of Denominative verbs, no ordinary verb can begin with a long ॠ ॥ Why have we employed the word धातु, when the word '<i>upasarga</i>' would have caused us to infer its correlative धातु? It is used in order to prevent the application of the rule [[6.1.129]] which causes प्रकृतिभावः or non-<i>sandhi</i> of ऋ ॥ The repetition of '<i>Dhatu</i>' shows that the alternative <i>prakriti</i> <i>bhava</i> taught in [[6.1.129]], would not apply in the case of the ऋ of a <i>Dhatu</i>.
