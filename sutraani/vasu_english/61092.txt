According to the opinion of आपिशलि, the वृद्धि is optionally the single substitute, when the अ or आ of a preposition is followed by a Denominative Verb beginning with ऋ।
Thus उपार्षभीयति or उपर्षभीयति, उपल्कारीयति or उपाल्कारीयति ॥ The ऋ and लृ are considered as homogenous letters, therefore the word ऋ in the last <i>sutra</i> includes लृ also. The name of the Grammarian <i>Apisali</i> is mentioned for the sake of respect; the वा itself was enough to make it an optional rule.
