Of such a doubled sound-imitation word, to which the affix आ is added which causes elision of the final अत् , for the final त् of the first member and the initial consonant of the second member, such subsequent consonant is always the single substitute.
Thus पटपटा करोति [[5.4.57]], दमदमा करोति ॥ पटत्पटत् + डाच् [[5.4.57]] = पटत्पटा = पटपटा (त् + प् = प्) ॥ This <i>sutra</i> is really a <i>Vartika</i>. When the affix डाच् [[5.4.57]] is added to पटत्, there is doubling of the word by the <i>Vartika</i> under [[8.1.12]]: this doubling takes place before the final अत् is elided.
