There is the single substitution of the first vowel, when a simple vowel is followed by the अ of the case ending अम्।
The word अकः is understood here. Thus वृक्ष + अम् = वृक्षम् [[7.1.24]] प्लक्षम्, अग्नि + अम् = अग्निम्, वायुम् ॥ The word पूर्व 'antecedent, first' in the <i>sutra</i> shows that the first vowel itself is substituted and not any of its homogenous vowels. Otherwise in कुमारी + अम् = कुमारीम् the ई would have been of three <i>matras</i> or measures, as it comes in the room of ई + अ, the aggregate <i>matras</i> of which are three.

In the Vedas, there is option, as शमीं or शम्यं, गौरीं or गौर्यम् ॥ अम् is the ending of the Accusative singular of all genders and also of the nominative singular in the Neuter in certain cases. (See [[7.1.23]], [[7.1.24]] and [[7.1.28]].
