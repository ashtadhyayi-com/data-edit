According to the opinion of स्फोटायन , there is the substitution of अवङ् for the ओ of गो when it is followed by any vowel.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of अति ceases, that of आर्च manifests itself. Thus गो + अग्र = गवाग्रम्, so also गवाजिनम्, गवौदनम्, गवोष्ट्रम्, or in the alternative we have गोऽग्रम्, गोऽजिनम्, गवोदनम्, गवुष्ट्रम् ॥ The substitute अवङ् is accutely accented on the first syllable. This accent will be the original accent in the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound [[6.2.1]]. Thus गावा अग्रमस्य = गवाग्रः ॥ In other places, however, this accent will be superseded by the <i>samasanta</i> <i>Udatta</i> accent [[6.1.223]] The mention of <i>Sphotayana</i> is for the sake of respect, for the <i>anuvritti</i> of विभाषा was already understood in it. This is a <i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>, hence in गवाक्षः the अवङ् substitution is compulsory and not optional.
