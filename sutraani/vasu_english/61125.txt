The प्लुत ([[8.2.82]] etc.) and प्रगृह्य ([[1.1.11]] etc.) vowels remain unaltered when followed by a vowel (so far as the operation of that vowel is concerned).
Thus देवदत्ता ३ अत्र न्वसि, यज्ञदत्ता ३ इदम् आनय ॥ These are examples of prolated vowels. The prolation of vowels is taught in the <i>tripadi</i> or the last three chapters of <i>Ashtadhyayi</i>; and the <i>tripadi</i> are considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of previous <i>sutras</i> [[8.2.1]]. This is not the case here, otherwise the mention of <i>pluta</i> would be redundant. Of the Excepted or <i>Pragrihya</i> vowels the following are the examples : अग्नी इति, वायू इति, खट्वे इति, माले इति ॥ Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of अचि was current in this <i>sutra</i> from [[6.1.77]]: its repetition here is for the sake of ordaining प्रकृतिभाव ॥ That is, the <i>pluta</i> and the <i>pragrihya</i> retain their original forms when such a vowel follows which would have caused a substitution. Thus जानु उ अस्य, रुजति here in combining जानु + उ into जानू, the अ is no cause of lengthening, therefore, the lengthening will take place. Now since उ is a <i>pragrihya</i>, it follows that जानू which ends in उ is also a <i>pragrihya</i>, and therefore it should not be changed before  अ of अस्य ॥ Hence we have the form जानू + अस्य = जानू अस्य ॥ There may also be the form जान्वस्य, not by इकोयणचि, but by मय उञो वो वा [[8.3.33]]. In fact, the repetition of अचि in this <i>sutra</i> is necessary, in order to enable us to give this peculiar meaning to the <i>sutra</i>. Otherwise, had the <i>sutra</i> been simply प्लुतप्रगृह्याः, it would have been translated ordinarily thus: "The <i>Pluta</i> and <i>Pragrihya</i> retain their form, when ever a vowel follows". Therefore in जानु उ अस्य, since उ is followed by a vowel, it will retain its form, and will not coalesce with the उ of जानु ॥ But this is not intended. Hence the repetition of the word अचि, and the peculiar explanation given above, namely, <i>Pluta</i> and <i>Pragrihya</i> vowels retain their form before a vowel which would otherwise have caused a substitution, but it would not prevent the operation of any other rule. Therefore in जानु उ अस्य रुजति, the उ + उ will become lengthened, because अ is not the cause of lengthening; it causes the change of उ to व्, which of course is prevented. The word नित्य of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here also. These <i>pluta</i> and <i>pragrihya</i> always retain their form and are not influenced by the rule of shortening given in [[6.1.127]].
