Before the word इति in the पदपाठ , a प्लुत vowel is treated like an ordinary अप्लुत vowel.
The word उपस्थित means the affixing of इति in non-<i>Rishi</i> texts; i, e. when a Vedic text is split up into its various <i>padas</i> or words and इति is added. That is in <i>Padapatha</i>, the <i>Pluta</i> is treated like an ordinary vowel, and hence there being no प्रकृतिभाव [[6.1.125]], there is <i>sandhi</i>. Thus सुश्लोका ३ इति = सुश्लोकेति, सुमङ्गला इति = सुमंगलेति ॥ Why have we used the word वत् "like as"; instead of saying "the <i>Pluta</i> becomes <i>Apluta</i>" why do we say "<i>Pluta</i> is treated like <i>apluta</i>"? By not using वत्, the whole <i>Pluta</i> itself would be changed into <i>Apluta</i>, and would give rise to the following incongruity. There is <i>prakriti</i> <i>bhava</i> in the case of <i>pluta</i> and <i>pragrihya</i>. A vowel which is <i>pluta</i> need not be <i>pragrihya</i>, nor a <i>pragrihya</i>, a <i>pluta</i>. But where a vowel is both a <i>pluta</i> and a <i>pragrihya</i> at one and the sametime, there will arise the difficulty. Thus in the dual अग्नी or वायू, the इ and ऊ are <i>pragrihya</i>. They may be made <i>pluta</i> also as अग्ना ३ or वायू ३ ॥ Now if before इति, the <i>pluta</i> became <i>apluta</i>, then we shall not hear the prolation at all in अग्नी इति वायू इति formed by अग्नी ३ + इति &c. For here the vowels will retain their form by being <i>pragrihya</i> by [[6.1.125]], and in addition to that they will lose their <i>pluta</i>, by the present rule. But this is not intended. Hence the <i>pluta</i> is heard in अग्नी ३ इति, वायू ३ इति ॥
