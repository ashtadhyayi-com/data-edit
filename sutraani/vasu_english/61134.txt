The case affix of सस् 'he', is elided before a vowel, if by such elision the meter of the foot becomes complete.
<i>Karika</i>

सैष दाशरथी रामः, सैष राजा युधिष्ठिरः॥
सैष कर्णो महात्यागी सैष भीमो महाबलः ॥

Thus सेदु राजा क्षयति चर्षणीनाम् (<i>Rig</i> I.32.15) सौषधीरनुरुध्यसे (<i>Rig</i> VIII.43.9). The case-ending being elided, the <i>Sandhi</i> takes place. Why do we say 'when by such elision the metre of the line is completed'? Observe स इव व्याघ्रो भवेत् ॥ The word अचि in the <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of distinctness:for the purposes of <i>metre</i> would not have been served by eliding the affix before a consonant, for then the syllables would remain the same. It is by <i>sandhi</i> that a syllable is lessened; and <i>sandhi</i> would take place only with a vowel. Some explain the word पाद as 'a foot of a <i>Sloka</i>' also, and according to them this rule is not confined to Vedic metres only. Thus we have:- सैष दाशरथी रामः, सैष राजा युधिष्ठिरः, सैष कर्णो महात्यागी सैष भीमो महाबलः ॥
