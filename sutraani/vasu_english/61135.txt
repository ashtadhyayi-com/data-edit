Up to [[6.1.157]] inclusive, the following sentence is to be supplied in every aphorism - 'before क is added स्'.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i> and extends upto [[6.1.157]]. Whatever we shall teach hereafter, in all those, the phrase 'the augment सुट् is placed before the letter क्' should be supplied to complete the sense. Thus [[6.1.137]] teaches "After सम्, परि and उप when followed by the verb कृ, the sense being that of adorning". Here the above phrase should be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense, i. e. "the augment स् is added before the क् of कृ when it is preceded by सम्, परि and उप, and the sense is that of adorning". Thus सम् + स् + कृ + तृ = संस्कर्ता, संस्कर्तुम्, संस्कर्तव्यम् ॥ In the succeeding aphorisms it will be seen that the augment सुट् comes only before those roots which begin with क ॥ What is then the necessity of using the phrase कात्पूर्वः in this <i>sutra</i>? It is used to indicate that the स् remains unattached to क्, though it stands before it. Thus though कृ becomes स्कृ, yet the latter should not be considered to be a verb beginning with a conjunct (<i>sanyoga</i>) consonant:and therefore the <i>guna</i> taught in [[7.4.10]] (the root ending in ऋ and preceded by a conjunct letter, takes <i>guna</i> before लिट्) does not apply, nor do the rules like [[7.4.29]], nor the rules ordaining the addition of intermediate इट् [[7.2.43]] by which the इट् would come in लिङ् and सिच् (Imperfect and Aorist); as, संस्कृषीष्ट and समस्कृत; and so also [[7.4.29]], does not apply as संस्क्रियते the Passive Imperfect (यकि लिङि) of संस्कृ ॥ If so, then the <i>anudatta</i> accent taught in [[8.1.28]] would not take place, since the augment सुट् would intervene between the non-तिङ्-word सं and the तिङन्त word करोति, thus संस्करोति would have accent on the verb. It is a maxim स्वरविधौ व्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् 'in applying a rule relating to accent the intervening consonants are considered as if non-existent'; and therefore सुट् does not offer any intervention to the application of the rule [[8.1.28]]. If स् is not to be taken as attached to क, how do you explain the <i>guna</i> in the Perfect 3rd Person Dual and Plural in संचस्करतुः and संचस्करुः which apparently is done by applying [[7.4.10]]. Though that rule strictly applies to roots beginning with a conjunct consonant, it will apply also to roots like संस्कृ which have a conjunct consonant for their penultimate; and the <i>guna</i> is done also on the maxim तन्मध्यपतितस्तद् ग्रहणेन गृह्यते (See [[6.1.132]]). The indicatory ट् in सुट् is for the purpose of differentiating it from सु in the <i>Sutra</i> [[8.3.70]].
