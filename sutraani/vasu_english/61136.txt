The augment सुट् is placed before क even when the augment अट् [[6.4.71]] or the Reduplicate intervenes (between the preposition and the verb).
Thus समस्करोत् (= सम् + अकरोत्), समस्कार्षीत्, संचस्कार (= सम् + चकार), परिचस्कार ॥ This <i>sutra</i> is not that of <i>Panini</i>, but is made out of two <i>Vartikas</i>:अड् व्यवाय उपसंख्यानाम्; and अभ्यासव्यवाये च ॥ The augmented root स्कृ would have given the form चस्कार by [[7.4.61]], if स् be considered an integral part of कृ, and no rule of <i>Antaranga</i> and <i>Bahiranga</i> be taken into consideration. It might be said where is the necessity then of this <i>sutra</i>? The operation relating to a <i>Dhatu</i> and <i>Upasarga</i> is <i>Antaranga</i>, i. e. a root is first joined with the <i>Upasarga</i>, and it undergoes other operations afterwards. Therefore, first the augment सुट् is added, and then the अट् and आभ्यास operations take place. Thus संस्कृ is the form to which अट् and अभ्यास operations are to be applied. Now, we have said in the foregoing aphorism, that सुट् is considered as unattached to क; and therefore, the augment अट् may be added after this सुट्, and so also the reduplication may take place without it. Thus we may have the forms like संस्करोत् and संस्चकार ॥ But this is not desired, hence the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i> teaching that even after अट् and reduplicate, the सुट् must be placed before क and no where else.
