The augment सुट् is placed before क , when the verb कृ comes after उप , and the sense is that of 'to cut or to split'.
Thus उपस्कारं मद्रका लुनन्ति, उपस्कारं काश्नीरका लुनन्ति = विक्षिप्य लुनन्ति ॥

Vart:- The above augment takes place when णमुल् is added to the verb उप-कृ, as shown in the above examples. When the meaning is not that of 'to cut', the form is उपकिरति ॥
