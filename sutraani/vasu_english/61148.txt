The word अवस्कर is formed by सुट् meaning 'excrement'.
That which has bad lustre is called वचस्क (कुत्सितं) ॥ It applies to the ejected food. To the root कृ is added the affix अप् [[3.3.57]], the preposition अव and irregularly the सुट् ॥ Thus अवस्करोऽन्नमलम् ॥ The place where the excreta lie (the rectum) is also so called. When not having this sense, we have अवकरः ॥
