The word विषिकर is formed with सुट् optionally when denoting a kind of bird, the other form being विकार।
<i>Verse</i>

सर्वे शकुनयो भक्ष्या विष्किराः कुक्कुटादृते ।

This word is formed by adding the affix क [[3.1.135]] to कृ with the preposition वि and the augment सुट् ॥ The word विकिर also refers to birds only, a kind of cock. The phrase शकुनिर्विकिरा वा is added from the <i>Vartika</i> and is no part of the original <i>sutra</i>. Thus सर्वे शकुनयो भक्ष्या विष्किराः कुक्कुटादृत ॥ Though the <i>sutra</i> विष्किरोवाशकुनौ would have given the optional form विकिर, the specific mention of this form in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that विकिर always means 'bird' and nothing else. Otherwise विकिर would have referred to some thing other than a bird.
