The word मस्कर means 'a bamboo', and मस्करिन् means 'a medicant monk'.
When not having these meanings, the form is मकरः ॥ This is an underived nominal stem, having no derivation, to which सुट् is added when 'a bamboo' is meant; and the affix इनि in addition, when a mendicant is to be expressed and thus we have मस्कर and मस्करिन् ॥ Why do we say "when meaning a bamboo or a mendicant". Observe मकरोग्राहः "an alligator", मकरा समुद्र "an ocean". Some say the word मकर is a derivative word, being derived from कृ 'to do' with the negative particle मा and the affix अच्, the long आ being shortened. Thus मा क्रियते येन प्रतिषिध्यते = मस्करः 'a bamboo or stick by which the prohibition is made'. So also by adding that इनि in the sense of ताच्छील्य to the root कृ preceded by the <i>upapada</i> मा; we get मस्करिन् ॥ Thus मा करणशाला = मस्करी "a monk, who has renounced all works". A mendicant always says "मा कुरुतः कर्माणि शान्तिर्वः श्रेयसी" - "Do no works ye men, for peace is your highest end".
