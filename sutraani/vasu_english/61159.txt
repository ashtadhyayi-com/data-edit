A stem formed with the कृत-affix घञ् has the acute accent on the end-syllable, if it is formed from the root कृष् (कर्षति) or has a long आ in it.
Thus कर्षः꣡, पाकः꣡, त्यागः꣡, रागः꣡, दायः꣡, धायः꣡ ॥ This is an exception to [[6.1.197]] by which affixes having an indicatory ञ् have acute accent on the first syllable. The word कर्ष is used in the aphorism instead of कृष्, to indicate that कृष of <i>Bhvadi</i> <i>gana</i> is affected by this rule, and not कृष् — कृषति of <i>Tudadigana</i>. The word क꣡र्षः derived from <i>Tudadi</i> कृष् has acute accent on the first syllable.
