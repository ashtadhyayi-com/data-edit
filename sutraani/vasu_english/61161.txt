An unaccented vowel gets also the acute accent, when on account of it preceding acute is elided.
The word <i>udatta</i> is understood here. Thus कुमार꣡ + ई॒ = कुमा॒री꣡ ॥ The word कुमार has acute on the last, when the unaccented (<i>anudatta</i>) ङीप् is added to it, the अ꣡ is elided [[6.1.148]], the <i>anudatta</i> ई॒ becomes <i>udatta</i>. So also प॒थिन्꣡ + श॒स् = प॒थः꣡ [[7.1.88]], प॒थिन् + ए॒ = प॒थे, प॒थिन् + आ॒ = प॒था꣡ ॥ The पथिन् has acute on the last. So also कुमुद + ड्मतुप् = कुमुद्वा꣡न् [[4.2.87]], न॒ड्व꣡त्, वे॒तस्वत् ॥ The words कुमुद &c, are end-acute, and the affix मत् (वत्) is <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]].

Why 'an <i>anudatta</i> vowel gets &c'. Observe प्रा॒सङ्गः + य॑त् = प्रासङ्ग्यः ॥ (प्रासङ्गं वहति [[4.4.76]]). Here though प्रसङ्ग꣡ is end-acute [[6.2.144]] formed by घञ् with _<i>gati</i>)) it is followed by य॑ which is <i>svarita</i> [[6.1.185]], this <i>svarita</i> causes the <i>lopa</i> of अ꣡ <i>udatta</i>: but it does not itself become <i>udatta</i>. No, this is not a proper counter-example. For by the general rule of accent [[6.1.158]], when one syllable is ordained to be <i>udatta</i> or <i>svarita</i>, all the other syllables of that word become <i>anudatta</i>. Therefore when य॑ is taught to be <i>svarita</i>, all the other syllables (like ङ्ग꣡) will become <i>anudatta</i>. So there is no <i>lopa</i> of <i>udatta</i> when य॑ comes. The word अनुदात्त is used to indicate that the initial <i>anudatta</i> becomes <i>udatta</i>. Had <i>anudatta</i> not been used, the <i>sutra</i> would have been यत्रोदात्तलोपश्च, which would mean यस्मिन् प्रत्यये परत; उदात्तालुप्यते तस्यान्त उदात्तो भवति, for the <i>anuvritti</i> of अन्त would then be read from the last. There would then be anomaly in the case of मा हि धुक्षाताम्, and माहि धुक्षाथाम् ॥ From the root दुह we have formed धुक्षाताम् and धुक्षाथाम् in the Aorist Atmanepada<i>, dual. दुह् + क्स꣡ + आताम् = दुह् + स् [[7.3.72]] + आताम् ॥ Here आताम् causes the elision of the </i>udatta<i> अ of स ॥ Therefore the final of आता꣡म् would be </i>udatta<i>, which is not desired. The augment अ is not added because of मा, had it been added, the अ꣡ would have been </i>udatta<i> [[6.4.71]]. Had हि not been given, then also the whole of धुक्षाताम् would have become </i>anudatta<i> in माधुक्षाताम् because of तिङ्ङतिङः [[8.1.28]]. See [[8.1.34]] (हि च). Why have we used the word यत्र in the </i>sutra<i>? If it was not employed, then the subsequent </i>anudatta<i> may be such which would not have caused the elision of the previous </i>udatta<i>; such </i>udatta<i> being elided by some other operator, and still such </i>anudatta<i> would have become </i>udatta<i>. Thus in भार्गवः, भार्गवौ, भृगवः ॥ Here भृगवः is plural of भार्गवः ॥ The word भार्गव is end-acute and this acute (अण्) was elided in the plural, before the affix जस् was added. The elision here is not caused by जस्, but is a subject of जस् (not निमित्त but विषय). Therefore जस् does not become </i>udatta<i>, which would have been the case, had यत्र not been used. प्राक् सुबुत्पत्ते गोत्रप्रत्ययस्य लुक् ॥ The </i>gotra<i> affix was elided prior to the adding of the case-ending. Why do we say "when an </i>udatta<i> is elided"? Observe बिद + अञ् [[4.1.104]] = ब꣡द ॥ The feminine of this will be बैद꣡ + ङीन् [[4.1.73]] = बैदी꣡ ॥ Here ई causes the elision of </i>anudatta_ अ of द, and hence remains unchanged. So also आ꣡ र्वी ॥
