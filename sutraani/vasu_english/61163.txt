A stem (formed by an affix or an augment or substitute) having an indicatory च् gets acute on the end syllable.
Thus भंगुर꣡म्, भासुर꣡म्, मेदुर꣡म्. These are formed by घुरच् [[3.2.161]]. So also कुण्डिनाः by [[2.4.70]] where the substitute कुण्डिनच् is employed. To कुण्ड is added इनि in the sense of मतुप्, then is added the feminine affix ङीप्, thus कुण्डि꣡नी has middle-acute. The descendants of <i>Kundini</i> will be काण्डिन्यः (by यञ् of <i>Gargadi</i>). The plural of <i>Kaundinya</i> will be formed by eliding यञ् and substituting कुण्डिनच for the remaining portion. In the cases of affixes having an indicatory च, the acute accent falls on the final, taking the stem and the affix in an aggregate. Thus बहुपटुः꣡ ॥ The affix बहुच् is one of those few affixes which are really prefixes. [[5.3.68]], The accent will not, therefore, fall on हु, but on the last syllable of the whole word compounded of the prefix + the base. So also with the affix अकच्. It is added in the middle of the word, but the accent will fall on the end; as उच्चैकः꣡ [[5.3.71]].
