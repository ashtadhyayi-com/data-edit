A stem formed with a तद्धित-affix having an indicatory च् , has acute on the end syllable.
Thus काञ्जायनाः꣡ formed by the affix च्फञ् [[4.1.98]]. कुञ्ज + च् फञ् + ञ्य = कौ꣡ञ्जायन्यः dual कौ꣡ञ्जायन्यौ, plural कौञ्जायनाः꣡ (ञ्य being elided by [[2.4.62]], and thus giving scope to च्फञ् accent). In this affix there are two indicatory letters च and ञ; the च has only one function, namely, regulating the accent according to this rule, while ञ has two functions, one to regulate accent by [[6.1.197]], and another to cause <i>Vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.117]]. Now arises the question, should the word get the accent च or of ञ ॥ The present rule declares that it should get the accent of च and not of ञ, for the latter finds still a function left to it, while if ञ was to regulate the accent, च would have no scope.
