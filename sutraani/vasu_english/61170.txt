In the छन्दस् , the case-endings other than the सर्वनामस्थान , get the acute accent when coming after अञ्चि।
In the Vedas, a stem ending in the word अञ्च्, has the acute not only on the affixes previously mentioned, but on the accusative plural affix also. Thus इन्द्रा द॒धीची꣡ अस्थभिः (<i>Rig</i> I.84.13). Here the word दधीच् had accent on धी by [[6.1.222]], but by the present <i>sutra</i>, the accent falls on the case-affix अस् ॥ Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of "Instrumentals and the rest" was understood here, the word <i>asarvanamasthana</i> has been used here to include the ending शस् also. As प्रतीचा꣡ बाहून् प्रतिभङ्व्येषाम् ॥
