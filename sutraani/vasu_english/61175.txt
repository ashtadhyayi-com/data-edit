But not so, when the vowel is of the feminine affix ऊ [[4.1.66]], or the final of a root.
After the semi-vowel substitutes of the <i>udatta</i> ऊ [[4.1.66]] or of the <i>udatta</i> final vowels of the root, when preceded by a consonant, the weak case-endings beginning with a vowel do not take the acute accent. Thus ब्रह्मब॒न्ध्वा॑, ब्रह्मब॒न्ध्वे॑, धीरब॒न्ध्वा॑, धीरब॒न्ध्वे॑ from धीरबन्धू꣡, which has acute accent ऊ, because ऊ꣡ञ् is <i>udatta</i> [[3.1.3]], and the <i>ekadesa</i> of it, when it combines with the preceding vowel is also <i>udatta</i> [[8.2.5]]. The व substituted for ऊ before the ending आ, is a semi-vowel substitute of an <i>udatta</i> (उदात्तयण्) the affix after it would have become <i>udatta</i> by the last <i>sutra</i>, but not being so, the general rule [[8.2.4]] applies and makes it <i>svarita</i>. Let us take an example of a semi-vowel substitute of the vowel of a root (धातु - यण्):- स॒कृल्ल्वा॑, सकृल्ल्वे॑; ख॒लप्वे॑ from सकृल्लू꣡, खलपू꣡ formed by क्विप् affix, the second member of the compound retaining its original accent, namely, the oxytone, the semi-vowel being substituted by [[6.4.83]] before the vowel case-endings.
