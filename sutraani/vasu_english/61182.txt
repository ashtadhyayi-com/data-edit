The foregoing rules from [[6.1.168]] downwards have no applicability after गो , and श्वन् and words ending in them; nor after a stem which before the case ending of the Nominative Singular has अ or आ , nor after रज् , or after a stem ending in अञ्च् , nor as well as after कुञ्च् and कृत्।
Thus ग꣡वा, ग꣡वे, गो꣡भ्याम् ॥ Here by [[6.1.168]], the case-endings would have got otherwise the accent, which is however prohibited. So also सुगु꣡ना, सुग꣡वे and सुगु꣡भ्याम् ॥ Here [[6.1.169]] is prohibited. So also शु꣡ना, शु꣡ने, श्व꣡भ्याम्, परमशु꣡ना, परमशुन and परमश्व꣡भ्याम् ॥ The word साववर्णः (सौ अवर्णः) means "what has अ or आ before सु (Ist. singular)" Thus ये꣡भ्यः, ते꣡भ्यः, के꣡भ्यः ॥ राज् :- रा꣡जा, रा꣡जे, पररा꣡जा ॥ (The word राज is formed by क्विप् affix): अङ् = अञ्च् + क्विन्; the prohibition applies to that form of this word wherein the nasal is not elided [[6.4.30]]. Thus प्रा꣡ञ्चा, प्रा꣡ङ्भ्याम् ॥ Where the nasal is elided, there the case-ending must take the accent; as प्रा॒चा꣡, प्रा॒चे꣡, प्रा॒ग्भ्या꣡म् ॥ क्रुङ् is also a क्विन् formed word. Thus क्रु꣡ञ्चा, क्रु꣡ञ्चे, परमक्रु꣡ञ्चा ॥ कृत् is derived from कृ 'to do' or from कृत् 'to cut' by क्विप्; as कृ꣡ता कृ꣡ते and परमकृ꣡ता ॥ Why has the word श्वन् been especially mentioned in this <i>sutra</i>, when the rule would have applied to it without such enumeration, because in the Nominative Singular this word assumes the form श्वा and consequently it is साववर्णः? The inclusion of श्वन् indicates that the elision of न should not be considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of this rule. Therefore, the present rule will not apply to words like नृ and पितृ which in Nominative Singular end in आ, as ना and पिता after the elision of न् of अनड् [[7.3.94]]. Thus the Locative Singular of नृ will be नरि by [[6.1.168]], this prohibition not applying, and the affix मतुप् will get <i>udatta</i> after पिता by [[6.1.176]] as पितृमा꣡न् ॥ But rule [[6.1.176]] will be debarred by the present in the case of वृक्ष꣡वान् because वृक्ष is a साववर्ण ॥
