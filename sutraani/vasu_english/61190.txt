Also when the unaccented endings of the three persons in the singular follow, the first syllable of the reduplicate has the acute.
The endings तिप् सिप् and मिप् are <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]. This <i>sutra</i> applies to those personal endings which do not begin with a vowel. Thus द꣡दाति, ज꣡हाति, द꣡धाति, जि꣡हीते, मि꣡मीते ॥ The word अनुदात्त is to be construed here as a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> i. e. an affix in which there is no <i>udatta</i> vowel, so that the rule may apply when a portion of the affix is elided or a semivowel is substituted : as मा हि द꣡धात्, and दधा꣡त्यत्र ॥
