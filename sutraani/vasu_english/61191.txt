The acute is on the first syllable of सर्व when the case-endings follow.
Thus सर्वः, सर्वाः꣡ स꣡र्वे ॥ Why do we say when the case-endings follow? Observe सर्व꣡तरः, सर्व꣡तमः the acute is on र्व ॥ The word सर्व has acute on the final, as it is so taught in the <i>Unadi</i> list by निपातन् ॥ It thus being <i>anudattadi</i> takes the affix अञ् and forms सार्वः (सर्वस्य विकारः) This rule applies even when the case affix is elided in spite of the prohibition of न लुमताङ्गस्य (I.I.63): as स꣡र्वस्तोमः ॥

Vart:- The rule does not apply when the affix अकच् is put in : as सर्वकः꣡ ॥ Here the accent is on the final by चित् accent [[6.1.163]].
