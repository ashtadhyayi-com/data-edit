The first syllable may be optionally acute when the absolutive affix णमुल् follows.
Thus लो꣡लूयम् or लोलू꣡यम् ॥ In the reduplicate form लोलू, the second part लू is unaccented by [[8.1.3]]. The present <i>sutra</i> makes लो accented. When लो is not accented, लू will get the accent by लित् accent. This rule is confined to polysyllabic Absolutives, namely to reduplicated Absolutives [[8.1.4]].
