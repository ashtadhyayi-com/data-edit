Before the ending थ of the Perfect, Second Person Singular, when this ending takes the augment इ ; the acute accent falls either on the first syllable, or on this इ , or on the personal ending.
Thus लु꣡लविथ, लुल꣡विथ, लुलविथ꣡, and लुलविथ꣡. As थल् has an indicatory ल्, the syllable preceding the affix may have also the accent [[6.1.193]]. Thus we get the four forms given above. In short, with इथ termination, the accent may fall on any syllable. When the थ is not सेट्, the accent falls on the root and we have one form only by लिट् accent [[6.1.193]] :- ययाथ ॥
