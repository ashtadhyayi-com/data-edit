Whatever is derived with an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् , has the acute accent invariably on the first syllable.
Thus गा꣡र्ग्य with यञ् [[4.1.105]], वा꣡सुदेवकः, अ꣡र्जुनकः with थुन् [[4.3.98]]. This is an exception to [[3.1.3]]. When the affixes are, however, elided, the word loses this accent, i. e. the affix does not leave its mark behind, as it generally does by [[1.1.62]]. Therefore गर्गाः꣡, बिदाः꣡, चञ्चाः꣡ having lost यञ्, अञ् and कन्, have lost their accent also.
