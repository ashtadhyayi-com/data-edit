The first syllable of a Vocative gets the acute accent.
Thus दे꣡वदत्त !, दे꣡वदत्तौ !, दे꣡वदत्ताः ॥ This debars the final accent ordained by [[6.2.148]]. Though the affix may be elided by a लुमान् word (लुक्, लुप् or श्लु), yet the effect of the affix remains behind in spite of [[1.1.63]]. As स꣡र्पिरागच्छ ! स꣡प्ता गच्छत ! ॥
