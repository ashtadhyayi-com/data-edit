The acute accent is on the first syllable of पथिन् and मथिन् when followed by a strong case-ending.
The words पथिन् and मथिन् are derived by the <i>Unadi</i> affix इनि, (IV. 12. and 13) and are oxytone by [[3.1.3]]. They become <i>adyudatta</i> before strong cases. Thus प꣡न्थाः, प꣡न्थानौ, प꣡न्थानः, म꣡न्थाः, म꣡न्थानौ, म꣡न्थानः ॥ Before other cases we have:- पथः꣡ पश्य, मथः꣡ पश्य ॥ The accent is on the final by [[6.1.162]], there being elision of the <i>udatta</i> इन् ॥ The rule [[1.1.62]], about the remaining effect of the affix, does not apply here. As पथि꣡प्रियः, has acute on the final of the first word, by retaining its original accent.
