The Infinitive in तवै has the acute on the first syllable and on the last syllable at one and the same time.
Thus क꣡र्तवै꣡, ह꣡र्तवै꣡ ॥ This is an exception to [[3.1.3]] by which त of तवै ought to have got the accent, and it also countermands rule [[6.1.158]] by which there can be only a single acute in a single word.
