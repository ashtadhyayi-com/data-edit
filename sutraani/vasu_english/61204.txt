The acute accent falls on the first syllable of that word with which something is likened, provided that it is a name.
Thus च꣡ञ्चा, व꣡घ्रिका, ख꣡रकुटी, दा꣡सी ॥ All these are उपमान words used as names of the उपमेय (the thing compared). The affix कन् [[5.3.96]] is elided here by [[5.3.98]]. It might be asked when कन् is elided, its mark, namely causing the first syllable to be acute [[6.1.197]], will remain behind by virtue of [[1.1.62]], where is then the necessity of this <i>sutra</i>. The formation of this <i>sutra</i> indicates that the प्रत्ययलक्षण rule is not of universal application in the rules relating to accent.

When the word is not a Name, we have अग्नि꣡र्माणवकः ॥ When it is not an <i>upamana</i> we have देवदत्तः꣡ [[6.2.148]].
