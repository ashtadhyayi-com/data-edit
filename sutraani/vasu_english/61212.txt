The acute accent is on the first syllable of युष्मद् and अस्मद् in the Dative Singular.
Thus तु꣡भ्यम् and म꣡ह्यम्, the forms त and मे are not governed by this rule. The making of two separate <i>sutras</i> is for the sake of preventing the application of यथासंख्य rule [[1.3.10]]. Had the <i>sutra</i> been यु꣡ष्मदस्मदोर्ङिङणोः, then <i>yushmad</i> in the Dative, and <i>asmad</i> in the Genitive alone would have taken this accent.
