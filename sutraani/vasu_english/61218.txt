The acute accent may be optionally on the penultimate syllable of the reduplicated Aorist in चङ् , the word consisting of more than two syllables.
Thus मा हि चीकर꣡ताम् or चीक꣡रताम् ॥ The augment अट् is elided by the addition of मा, [[6.4.74]]; हि prevents the verb from becoming <i>anudatta</i> [[8.1.34]] then comes the चित् accent of चङ् ॥ The augmented form with अट् has acute always on the first syllable [[6.4.71]]. When the word is of less than three syllables, the rule does not apply, as, माहि दध꣡त् ॥
