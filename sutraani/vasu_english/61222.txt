In compound words ending in अञ्च् , the final vowel of the preceding word has the acute accent in the weak cases in which only च् of अञ्च् remains.
Thus द꣡धीचः पश्य; द꣡धीचा, दधी꣡चेः मधू꣡चः पश्य, मधू꣡चा, मधू꣡चे ॥ This is an exception to [[6.1.161]], [[6.1.170]] and [[6.2.52]].

Vart:- This rule does not apply before a <i>Taddhita</i> affix. As दाधीचः꣡, माधूचः꣡ ॥ Here the accent is regulated by the affix [[3.1.3]].
