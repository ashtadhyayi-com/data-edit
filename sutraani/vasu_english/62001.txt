In a बहुव्रीहि समास the first member preserves its own original accent.
The word पूर्वपदम् means here the accent-whether <i>udatta</i> or <i>svarita</i> - which is in the first member: प्रकृत्या means, retains its own nature, does not become modified into an <i>anudatta</i> accent. By the rule [[6.1.223]], the final of a compound gets the accent, so that all the preceding members lose their accent and become <i>anudatta</i>, as in one word all syllables are unaccented except one. [[6.5.158]]. Thus the first member of a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> would have lost its accent and become <i>anudatta</i>; with the present <i>sutra</i> commences the exceptions to the rule that the final of a compound is always, <i>udatta</i>. Thus का꣡र्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गाः ॥ The word कार्ष्ण is derived by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix अञ् [[4.3.154]] from कृष्ण 'a kind of antelope;' and has the ञित् accent [[6.1.197]] i. e. on the first syllable: which the word preserves in the compound also. So also यू꣡पवलजः; the word यूप is derived from  यु by the <i>Unadi</i> affix प (<i>Unadi</i> III.27.), before which the vowel becomes lengthened (<i>Unadi</i> III.25) and the affix is treated as नित् (<i>Unadi</i> III.26), and hence the word is acutely accented on the first syllable [[6.1.197]]. So also ब्रह्मचारि꣡ परिस्कन्दः; the word ब्रह्मचारिन् has a <i>Krit</i> formed word as its second part, and gets the acute on the final [[6.2.139]]. So also स्ना꣡तकपुत्रः, the word स्नातक is derived by कन् [[5.4.29]] affix and has नित् accent [[6.1.197]] i. e. <i>udatta</i> on the first syllable. So also अध्या꣡पकपुत्रः, the word अध्यापक is accented on the middle as it is formed by a लित् affix [[3.1.133]], [[6.1.193]]. श्रो꣡त्रियपुत्रः, the श्रोत्रिय being enounced with an indicatory न् in <i>Sutra</i> [[5.2.84]] is acutely accented on the first. मनुष्य॑नाथः, the word मनुष्य being formed by यत् [[4.1.161]] a तित् affix is <i>svarita</i> [[6.1.185]].

The words <i>udatta</i> and <i>svarita</i> are understood in this aphorism. Therefore if all the syllables of the <i>purvapada</i> are <i>anudatta</i>, the present rule has no scope there, and such a compound will get <i>udatta</i> on the final by the universal rule enunciated in [[6.1.223]]. Thus समभागः꣡, here सम being all <i>anudatta</i>, the accent falls on ग ॥
