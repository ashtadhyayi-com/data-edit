In a तत्-पुरुष समास the first member preserves its original accent when it is a word - 1. meaning 'a resemblance' or 2. an Instrumental or 3. a Locative or 4. a word with which the second member is compared or 5. an indeclinable or 6. an Accusative or 7. a Future Passive Participle
Thus (1) तुल्यश्वेतः, तुल्यलोहित, तुल्यमहान्, सदृक्च्छ्वेतः, सदृग्लोहितः सदृग्महान् ॥ These are <i>Karmadharaya</i> compounds formed under [[2.1.68]]: and तुल्य being formed by यत् is acutely accented on the first [[6.1.216]]. The word सदृक् is formed by क्विन् [[3.2.60]] <i>Vartika)), and has acute on the final [[6.1.197]] and [[6.2.139]]. So also सदृशश्वेतः सदृशलोहितः, सदृशमहान् ॥ The word सदृश is formed by कञ् added to दृश्, and by [[6.1.197]] the accent falls on दृ [[6.2.139]]. (2) When the first member is in the Instrumental case, as :- शंकुलया खण्डः = शंकुलाखण्डः, so also किरिकाणः [[2.1.30]] शंकुला is derived from शंकु + ला ॥ To the root ला is added the affix क with the force of घञ्, and thus the noun ला is </i>udatta<i>, or the whole word शंकुला is a word formed by क affix and hence [[6.1.165]] applies and is final-acute. किरिः is formed by the </i>Unadi<i> affix इ to कृ (</i>Unadi<i> IV. 143), and it being treated as a कित् (</i>Unadi<i>. IV. 142) has </i>udatta<i> on the final.

(3) When the first member is a word in the Locative case, as :- अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्षशौण्डः, so also पानशौण्डः ॥ The word अक्ष is formed by the affix त added to अश् (</i>Un<i> III.65), and is final acute [[3.1.3]]. The word पान is formed by ल्यूट् affix added to पा, and is acute on the first [[6.1.193]] owing to the लित् accent. (4) When the first member is a word with which the second member is compared, as:- शस्त्रीश्यामा, कुमुदश्येनी, हंसगद्गदा, न्यग्रोधपरिमण्डला, दूर्वाकाण्डश्यामा, शरकाण्डगौरी ॥ These compounds are formed by [[2.1.55]]. शस्त्री is formed by ङीप् and is final-acute; कुमुद is formed by क affix (कौ मोदते = कुमुद) see [[3.2.5]]. </i>Vartika<i>)): and is acutely accented on the first, or by </i>Phit<i> </i>sutra<i> II.3 it has acute on the first. हंस is formed by the </i>Unadi<i> affix स added to हन् (</i>Unadi<i> III.62), and is finally accented [[3.1.3]]. न्यग्रोहति = न्यग्रोधः formed by अच् [[3.1.134]], and ह is irregularly changed into ध as </i>Panini<i> himself uses this form [[7.3.5]]: and it is accented in the middle. The words दूर्वाकाण्ड, शरकाण्ड are Genitive </i>Tatpurusha<i>, and their second member has accent on the first syllable [[6.2.135]], (5) When the first member is an Indeclinable, as, अब्राह्मणः, अवृषलः, कुब्राह्मणः, कुवृषलः ॥ निष्कौशाम्बिः, निर्वाराणासिः, अतिखट्वः, अतिमालः ॥ All these Indeclinable compounds have </i>udatta<i> on the first, they are formed by [[2.2.5]] &c.

Vart:- In cases of Indeclinable compounds, the rule applies only to those which are formed by the negative Particle अ, by कु, and by Particles (</i>nipata<i>). Though नञ्, is one of the </i>Nipatas<i>, its separate mention indicates that नञ्-accent debars even the subsequent कृत्-accent as अकरणिः ॥ Therefore, it does not apply here स्नात्वाकालकः which has acute on the final and belongs to </i>Mayuravyansakadi<i> class.

(6) When the first member as in the accusative case, as:- मुहूर्त्तसुखम्, मुहूर्त्तरमणीयम्, सर्वरात्रकल्याणी, सर्वरात्रशोभना ॥ They are formed by [[2.1.29]]. मुहूर्त्त belongs to पृषोदरादि class and is acutely accented on the last. सर्वरात्र is formed by the </i>samasanta<i> affix अच् and is finally accented.

(7) When the first member is a </i>Kritya<i>-formed word, as, भोज्यलवणम्, भोज्योष्णम्, पानीयशीतम्, हरणीयचूर्णम् [[2.1.68]]. भोज्य is formed by ण्यत् and has </i>svarita_ on the final : पानीय and हरणीय are formed by अनीयर् and are accented on the penultimate [[6.1.185]] and [[6.1.217]] i. e. on ई ॥
