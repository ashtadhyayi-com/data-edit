In a तत्-पुरुष समास having the words चिर or कृच्छ्र as its second member, the first member, when it denotes that which experiences an obstacle, preserves its original accent.
Thus ग꣡मनचिरम् or ग꣡मनकृच्छ्रम्, व्याह꣡रणचिरम् or  व्याह꣡रणकृच्छ्रम् ॥ The words गमन and व्याहरण are formed by ल्युट् affix, and have लित् accent [[6.1.193]]. This compound belongs either to the class of <i>Mayura</i>-<i>vyansakadi</i> [[2.1.72]], or of an attribute and the thing qualified. When going to a place is delayed owing to some defective arrangement or cause, or becomes difficult, there is produced an obstacle or hinderance, and is called गमनचिरं or गमनकृच्छ्रं ॥ Why do we say 'which experiences a hinderance'? Observe मुत्रकृच्छ्रम् ॥
