The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when the second member is the word अध्वर्यु or कषाय denoting a genus.
Thus प्रा꣡च्याध्वर्युः, कठा꣡ध्वर्युः, कालापाध्व꣡र्युः ॥ These are Appositional compounds denoting 'genus or kind', with a fixed meaning. प्राच्य is formed by यत्, and has accent on the first [[6.1.213]]. कठ is derived by अच् affix [[3.1.34]], and to it is added the <i>Taddhita</i> affix णिनि [[4.3.104]], in the sense of कठेन प्रोक्तं [[4.3.101]], and the affix is then elided by [[4.3.107]]. The word कालाप comes from कलापिन् + अण्, (IV. 3. I08) in the sense of कलापिना प्रोक्तं [[4.3.101]], and it would have preserved its form without change before this affix [[6.4.164]] but for a <i>vartika</i> which declares that the इन् of कलापिन् will be elided (See [[6.1.144]] <i>vartika</i>). Thus कालाप gets accent on the final [[3.1.3]]. So also सर्पिर्मण्ड꣡कषायम्, उमापुष्प꣡कषायम्, दौवारिक꣡कषायम् ॥ These are Genitive compounds. The words सर्पिमण्ड and उमापुष्प are Genitive compounds and have accent on the final [[6.1.223]]. The word दौवारिक is formed by ठक् affix added to द्वार and has acute on the final [[6.1.165]]. Why do we say when meaning a 'genus'? Observe, परमाध्व॒र्युः, परमकषा॒यः [[6.1.223]].
