Before the word वाणिज 'a trader' the first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its accent when it is a word specifying the place wither one has to go or the ware in which one deals.
Thus मद्र꣡वाणिजः, काश्मी꣡रवाणिजः, गा꣡न्धारिवाणिजः = मद्रादिषु गत्वा व्यवहरन्ति 'the <i>Madra</i>-merchants i. e. who trade by going to <i>Madra</i> &c' All these are Locative compounds. मद्र is derived by रक् affix (<i>Unadi</i> II, 13) and is acutely accented on the last [[6.1.165]]. काश्मीर belongs to <i>Krshodaradi</i> class [[6.3.109]], and has acute either on the first or the second syllable. The word गान्धारि belongs to the <i>Kardamadi</i> class, and is consequently acute on the first or the second (<i>Phit</i> III.10) In the sense of पण्य we have: गोवाणिजः 'a dealer in cows', अश्ववाणिजः &c. गौ is finally accented (<i>Unadi</i> II.67): and अश्व has acute on the first (<i>Unadi</i> I.151) the affix being क्वन् ॥

Why do we say 'the place whither one goes, or the goods in which one deals?' Observe परमवाणिजः꣡, उत्तमवणिजः꣡ ॥
