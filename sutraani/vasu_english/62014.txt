The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when the words 1. मात्रा 2. उपज्ञा 3. उपक्रम and 4. छाया when these words appear as neuter.
Thus भिक्षामात्रं न ददाति याचितः, समुद्र꣡मात्रं न सरोऽपि न सरोऽस्ति किंचन ॥ The word मात्रा is here synonymous with तुल्य, the phrase being भिक्षायास्तुल्यप्रमाणं, and is a Genitive compound. The word भिक्षा is derived from भिक्ष, by the feminine affix अ [[3.3.103]], and has acute on the final [[3.1.3]]. The word समुद्र has also acute on the final as it is a word denoting 'a sea', (<i>Phit</i> <i>sutra</i> I.2). So also with उपज्ञा, as पाणिनो꣡पज्ञमकालकं व्याकरणम्; व्या꣡डुपपज्ञं दुष्करणम् आपिशल्युपज्ञ गुरुलाघव (see [[2.4.21]]). All these are Genitive compounds. The word पाणिन is derived by अण् affix from पणिन् (पणिनोऽपत्यम् = पाणिन꣡), and has acute on the final, [[3.1.3]]. The word व्याडि being formed by इञ affix has acute on the first [[6.1.197]], so also आपिशालि ॥ So also with उपक्रम, as आढ्यो꣡पक्रमं प्रासादः, दर्शनी꣡योपक्रमम्, सुकुमारो꣡पक्रमम्, नन्दो꣡पक्रमाणि मानानि ॥ All these are Genitive compounds. The word आढ्य (तत्रैत्यैनं ध्यायन्ति) is derived from आ + ध्यै + क affix added with the force of घञ्, the ध being changed to ढ the word belonging to पृषोदरादि class [[6.3.109]], and it has acute on the final by [[6.2.144]]. The word दर्शनी꣡य is formed by अनीयर् and has acute on the penultimate नी owing to the indicatory र् [[6.1.217]]. The word सुकुमार has acute on the final by [[6.2.172]]. The word नन्द is formed by अच् [[3.1.134]]. The <i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds ending in उपज्ञा and उपक्रम are neuter by [[2.4.21]]. So also with छाया, as इ꣡षुच्छायम्, ध꣡नुच्छायम् ॥ The word इषु is derived from इष् by उ affix (<i>Unadi</i> I.I3), and it being treated as नित् (<i>Unadi</i> I.9) the acute falls on इ the first syllable [[6.1.197]]. The word धनुस् has also acute on the first by <i>Phit</i> <i>sutra</i> II.3. The compound is a Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i> -इषूणां छाया; and it is Neuter by [[2.4.22]]. When the compound is not a Neuter we have कुड्यछाया [[2.4.25]].
