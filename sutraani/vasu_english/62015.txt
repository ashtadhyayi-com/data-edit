The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when its second term is सुख or प्रिय and the sense is 'to feel delight' or 'is good'.
Thus ग꣡मनसुखम् 'the pleasure of going'. So also व꣡चनसुखम्, व्याह꣡रणसुखम्, ग꣡मनप्रियम्, व꣡चनप्रियम्, व्याह꣡रणप्रियम् ॥ These are appositional compounds. All the above words are formed by ल्युट् affix and have acute on the syllable preceding the affix [[6.1.193]]. The words <i>sukha</i> and <i>priya</i> have the sense of हित or 'well' 'good' 'beneficial', i. e. when the thing denoted by the first term is the cause of pleasure or delight. When this is not the sense we have परमसुख꣡म्, परमप्रिय꣡म् ॥
