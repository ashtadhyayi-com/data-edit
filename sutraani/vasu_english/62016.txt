The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when its second term is सुख or प्रिय and the sense is 'agreeable to one' or 'desired'.
Thus ब्राह्मणसुखं पायसं "the sweet milk desired by or agreeable to the <i>Brahmanas</i>", छात्रप्रियोऽनध्यायः ॥ कन्याप्रियो मृदङ्गः ॥ &c. The words ब्राह्मण and छात्र have acute on the final being formed by the affixes अण् and ण [[5.4.62]] respectively [[3.1.3]] and कन्या has <i>svarita</i> on the final. When not meaning agreeable to or desired, we have राजसुखम्, राजप्रियम् ॥
