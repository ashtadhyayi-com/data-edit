The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when it denotes a thing possessed and when its second term is स्वामिन्।
Thus गो꣡स्वामी, अ꣡श्वस्वामी, ध꣡नस्वामी ॥ The accents of गौ, अश्व and धन have already been mentioned before in [[6.2.14]]. When the first member is not a word denoting possession, we have परमस्वामी ॥
