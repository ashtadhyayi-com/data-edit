The first member of a तत्-पुरुष समास preserves its original accent when it ends in पति and means 'master' or 'lord'.
Thus गृह꣡पतिः, से꣡नापतिः, न꣡रपतिः, धान्य॑पतिः ॥ The word गृह is formed by क [[3.1.144]] and has acute on the final [[3.1.3]]. The word सेना is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> (सह इनेन वर्तते = से꣡ना), and by (VI.2. I) the first member retains its accent. The word नर is derived from नॄ 'to lead' by the affix अप् [[3.3.57]] and has acute on the first [[3.1.4]], the word धान्य॑ has <i>svarita</i> on the final (See <i>Phit</i> II.23?) Why do we say when meaning 'lord'? Observe ब्राह्मणो वृषलीपतिः꣡ "a <i>Brahmana</i>, husband of a <i>Sudra</i>".
