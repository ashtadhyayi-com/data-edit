The words भू , वाक् , चित् and दिधिषू however do not preserve their original accent in तत्-पुरुष समास when coming before the word पति denoting 'master' or 'lord'.
This debars the accent taught by the last aphorism. Thus भूपतिः꣡, वाक्पतिः꣡, चित्पतिः꣡, दिधिषूपतिः꣡ ॥ All these are Genitive compounds and are finally accented by [[6.1.223]].
