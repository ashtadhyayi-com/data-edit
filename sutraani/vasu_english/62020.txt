The word भुवन may optionally keep its accent in a तत्-पुरुष समास before the word पति denoting 'master' or 'lord'.
The word भुवन is formed by क्युन् (<i>Unadi</i>. II.80), and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. Though <i>Sutra</i> II.80 (<i>Unadi</i>) ordains क्युन् after भू in the Vedas only, yet on the theory of बहुल [[3.1.3]], it comes in the secular literature also, as भुवनपतिरादित्यः ॥
