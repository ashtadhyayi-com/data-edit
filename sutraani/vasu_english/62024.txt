The words विस्पष्ट etc. preserve their accent when followed by an adjective word in a compound.
Thus वि꣡स्पष्ट कटुकम्, वि꣡चित्रकटुकम् व्य॑क्तकटुकम्, वि꣡स्पष्टलवणम्, विचित्रलवणम्, व्य॑क्तलवणम् ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.1.4]], and it should be analysed thus विस्पष्टं कटुकम् &c.

The words विस्पष्ट &c, are indeed here adjectives, and in conjunction with कटु &c, they denote an object possessing those qualities; and therefore not being in apposition, the compound is not a <i>Karmadharaya</i>.

The word विस्पष्ट has acute on the first by [[6.2.49]]. The word विचित्र is also acute on the first as it gets the accent of the Indeclinable. Some read the word as विचित्र, which being a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> has also first acute. The word व्य॑क्त has <i>svarita</i> on the first by [[8.2.4]]. The remaining words of this class are संपन्न꣡, प꣡टु or कटु, पण्डित꣡, कुशल꣡, चपल꣡ and निपुण꣡. Of these, the word संपन्न꣡ has acute on the final by [[6.2.144]]; प꣡टु is formed by उ (<i>Unadi</i> I.18), which being considered as नित् (<i>Unadi</i> I.9), it has acute on the first. पण्डित is formed by क्त to the root पड्, and is finally acute [[6.2.144]]. कुशल has accent on the final being formed by a <i>krit</i> affix (कुशान् लाति = कुशलः, ला आदाने, or <i>Unadi</i> I.106), चपल being formed by a चित् affix (<i>Unadi</i> I.111), has acute on the final [[6.1.163]], for चित् is understood in the <i>Unadi</i> <i>sutra</i> <i>Unadi</i>. I.111 from <i>sutra</i> <i>Unadi</i>. I.106. The word निपुण has acute on the final by [[6.2.144]], being formed by क affix added to पुण् &c.

Why do we say 'of विस्पष्ट &c' Observe परमलवण꣡म् उत्तमलवण꣡म्, both having acute on the final. Why do we say "when followed by a word expressing a quality"? Observe विस्पष्टब्राह्मणः ॥
