In a कर्मधारय समास of कुमार followed by प्रत्येनस् the acutely accented (उदात्त) falls on the first syllable of कुमार।
The word प्रत्येनस् = प्रतिगत एनसा or प्रतिगतमेनो यस्य ॥ Thus कु꣡मारप्रत्येनाः ॥ The word <i>udatta</i> is required to be read into the <i>sutra</i> to complete the sense : for the construction of the <i>sutra</i> requires it, and the <i>anuvritti</i> of the 'first member preserves its accent' would be inappropriate because the word आदि is employed here.
