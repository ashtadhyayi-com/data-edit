In a द्विगु समास (Numeral Determinative Compound) the word बहु may optionally preserve its accent when followed by an इक्-ending stem or by a time-word or by 1. कपाल 2. भगाल and 3. शराव।
This allows option where the last rule required the accent necessarily. Thus बह्व॑रत्निः or बह्वरत्निः, बहु꣡मास्यः or बहुमास्यः꣡, बहु꣡कपालः or बहुकपालः꣡, बहु꣡भगालः or बहुभगालः꣡, बहु꣡शरावः or बहुशरावः꣡ ॥ The word बहु꣡ has acute on the final being formed by the affix कु (<i>Unadi</i> I.29). When the उ is changed to व्, as in the first example, the <i>anudatta</i> अ is changed into <i>svarita</i> by _VIII.2.4): when the first member preserves its accent. In the other alternative, the accent falls on the last syllable.
