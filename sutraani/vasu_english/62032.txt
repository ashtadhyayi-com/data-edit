When a word ending in the Locative -7th case does not denote time preserves its original accent when followed by 1. सिद्ध 2. शुष्क 3. पक्व and 4. बन्ध in a compound.
Thus सांकाश्य꣡सिद्धः or सांका꣡श्यसिद्धः, काम्पिल्य꣡सिद्धः or काम्पि꣡ल्यसिद्धः ॥ The words <i>samkasya</i> and <i>kampilya</i> have acute on the final, and by <i>Phit</i> <i>Sutra</i> (III.16) in the alternative the accent falls on the middle also. So also निध꣡नशुष्कः, ऊक꣡शुष्कः ॥ The word निधन is derived by क्यु affix added to नि-धाञ् and has acute on the middle; the word ऊक is formed from अव् root by the affix कक्, and has acute on the final. So also भ्रा꣡ष्ट्रपक्वः, कुम्भी꣡पक्वः, कलशी꣡पक्वः ॥ The words <i>Kumbhi</i> and <i>Kalasi</i> are formed by ङीष् affix and have acute on the final; the word भ्राष्ट्र is formed by ष्ट्रन् affix, and has acute on the beginning. So also चक्र꣡बन्धः चा꣡रकबन्धः ॥ The word <i>chakra</i> has acute on the final, and <i>charaka</i> being formed by ण्वुल् has acute on the first.

Why do we say 'when not denoting time'? Observe पूर्वाह्णसिद्धः꣡, अपराह्णसिद्धः꣡ ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.1.41]]. The accent of the Locative <i>Tatpurusha</i> taught in [[6.2.1]] was debarred by <i>Krit</i>-accent taught [[6.2.144]]. The present <i>sutra</i> debars this last rule regarding <i>Krit</i> accent, and reordains the Locative <i>Tatpurusha</i> accent when the <i>Krit</i>-words are सिद्ध &c.
