The first member of a द्वन्द समास formed of names denoting the क्षत्रिय (warrior) clans in the plural number retains its original accent when the warrior belongs to the clan of अन्धक or वृष्णि।
Thus श्वाफल्क꣡चैत्रकाः, चैत्रक꣡रोधका, शि꣡निवासुदेवाः ॥ The words <i>Svaphalka</i> and <i>Chaitraka</i> are formed by अण् affix [[4.1.114]] and have acute on the last [[3.1.3]]. The word शिनि has acute on the first syllable, and does not change in denoting Patronymic. Why do we say 'in denoting a Warrior clan'? Observe द्वैप्यहैमायनाः ॥ Here द्वैप्य is derived from द्वीप by the affix यञ् (IV. 3. I0) = द्वीपे भवाः; हैमायनः = हैमेरपत्यं युवा ॥ These names belong to <i>Andhaka</i> and <i>Vrishni</i> clans, but are not the warrior-names. The word राजन्य here means those <i>Kshatriyas</i> who belong to the family of annointed kings and warriors (अभिषिक्तवंश्याः); these (<i>Dvaipya</i> and <i>Haimayana</i>) do not belong to any such family. Why do we say 'in the Plural number'? Observe संकर्षणवासुदेवौ꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'in a <i>Dvandva</i> compound'? Observe वृष्णीनां कुमाराः = वृष्णिकुमाराः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'of <i>Andhaka</i> and <i>Vrishni</i> clans'? Observe कुरुपञ्चालाः꣡ ॥
