The numeral word standing as the first member of a द्वन्द समास , preserves its accent.
Thus ए꣡कादश, द्वा꣡दश, त्र꣡योदश or त्रयोद꣡श ॥ The word एक is derived from इण् by कन् affix (<i>Unadi</i> III.43) and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. The त्रयस् is the substitute of  त्रि [[6.3.48]] and has acute on the final.
