When words denoting scholars are named after their teachers and are compounded into a द्वन्द समास the first member retains its accent.
The word अन्तेवासी means 'a pupil' 'a boarding not a day scholar'. When the scholar is named by an epithet derived from the name of his teacher, that name is आचार्योपसर्जनः or teacher-derived name. Thus आपिशल꣡पाणिनीयाः, पाणिनी꣡य-रौढीयाः, रौढी꣡यकाशकृत्स्नाः ॥ The son of <i>Apisala</i> is आपिशालि the name of a Teacher or founder of a school - an <i>acharya</i> : formed by इञ् affix [[4.1.95]]. The science taught by him is called आपिशलम्, formed by adding अण् affix to आपिशलाः [[4.3.101]] and [[4.2.11]]. The scholars who study the <i>Apisalam</i> are also called आपिशलाः the affix denoting 'to study' is elided by [[4.2.59]] and [[4.2.64]]. Or the pupils of <i>Apisali</i> will be also called <i>Apisalah</i>. Thus in both ways <i>Apisalah</i> is a scholar name derived from the name of a teacher. The word आचार्योपसर्जन qualifies the whole <i>Dvandva</i> compound and
not the first member only. That is, the whole compound in all its parts should denote scholars, whose names are derived from those of their teachers. Therefore not here पाणिनीय-देवदत्तौ where though the first is a teacher-derived name, the second is not. Why do we say "names derived from the teacher's"? Observe छान्दसवैयाकरणाः ॥ Why do we say "a Scholar"? Observe आपिशलपाणिनीये शास्त्रे ॥
