The word महत् (महा) retains its accent before the following - 1. व्रीहि 2. अपराह्ण 3. गृष्टि 4. इष्वास 5. जाबाल 6. भार 7. भारत 8. हैलिहिल 9. रौरव and 10. प्रवृद्धे।
Thus महा꣡व्रीहिः, महा꣡पराह्णः, महा꣡गृष्टिः, महे꣡ष्वासः, महा꣡जाबालः, महा꣡भारः, महा꣡भारतः, महा꣡हैलिहलः, महा꣡रौरवः, महा꣡प्रवृद्धः ॥ The महत् has acute on the final. (<i>Unadi</i> II.84) On the प्रतिपदोक्त maxim already mentioned under [[6.2.26]], this accent will apply to that compound of महत् which it forms under rule [[2.1.61]], for that is the particular rule of <i>Karmadharaya</i> compounding relating to <i>mahat</i> (<i>pratipadokta</i>). This rule therefore, will not apply to Genitive <i>Tatpurusha</i>. Thus महतो व्रीहिः = महद्व्रीहिः꣡ which has accent on the final by [[6.1.223]].

Q. The word प्रवृद्ध is a Participle formed by  क्त affix, and by rule [[6.2.46]], in a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound, the first member will retain its original accent. What is then the necessity of reading this word in this <i>sutra</i>? Ans. That <i>sutra</i> [[6.2.46]] applies, on the maxim of <i>pradipadokta</i>, to the special participles and nouns mentioned in [[2.1.59]] and not to every participle and noun.
