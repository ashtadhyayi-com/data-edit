The word उष्ट्र retains its accent before सादि and वामि।
Thus उ꣡ष्ट्रसादि and उ꣡ष्ट्रवामि ॥ The word उष्ट्र is derived from उप् by ष्ट्रन् affix (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 162) and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. This is either a <i>Karmadharaya</i> or a Genitive compound. In some texts the above examples are given with a <i>visarga</i> in the masculine, and not Neuter.
