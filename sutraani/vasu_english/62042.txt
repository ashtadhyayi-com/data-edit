The first member retains its accent in the following - 1. कुरु-गार्हपत 2. रिक्त-गुरु 3. असूत-जरती 4. अश्लील-दृढ-रूपा 5. पारे-वडवा 6. तैतिल-कद्रूः 7. पण्य-कम्बलः and 8. दासीभार etc.
The first seven words are compounds, the first two of these are exhibited without any case-ending, the remaining five are in nominative Singular. Thus कुरु꣡गार्हपतम् (कुरूणां गार्हपत, <i>Kuru</i> is formed by कु affix added to कृ <i>Unadi</i> I.24) and has acute on the final.

Vart:- So also वृ꣡जिगार्हपतम् , the word <i>Vriji</i> has acute accent on the first.

So also रिक्तो गुरुः = रि꣡क्तगुरुः or रिक्त꣡गुरुः for <i>rikta</i> has acute either on the first or on the second [[6.1.208]]. So also असूता जरती = अ꣡सूतजरती, अश्लीलादृढरूपा = अ꣡श्लील दृढरूपा ॥ <i>Asuta</i> and <i>aslila</i> being formed by नञ् particle have acute on the first : [[6.2.2]]. That which has श्री is called श्लील, the affix लच् being added by its belonging to <i>Sidhmadi</i> class, and र changed to ल by its belonging to <i>kapilakadi</i> class. So also पारे꣡वडबा, this is = पारेवडबेव ॥ This is a <i>samasa</i> with the force of इव, and there is elision of the case ending. The word पार belongs to <i>Ghritadi</i> class, and has acute on the final. तैतिलानां कद्रूः = तैतिल꣡कद्रूः, the son or pupil of <i>Titilin</i> is <i>Taitila</i> formed by अण् affix. पण्यकम्बलः, <i>panya</i> ends in यत् and has acute on the first [[6.1.213]].

Vart:- प꣡ण्यकम्बलः has acute on the first only when it is a name. Otherwise in पणितव्ये कम्बले compound, the accent will be on the final by the general rule [[6.1.223]]. The word पण्य being formed by यत् affix [[3.1.101]] is acutely accented on the first [[6.1.213]]. The word पण्यकम्बलः is as Name when it means the market-blanket i. e. a blanket of a well known determinate size and fixed price, which is generally kept for sale by the blanket-sellers. But when the compound means a saleable blanket, it takes the <i>samasa</i> accent [[6.1.223]]. If it be objected what is the use this <i>Vartika</i>, for the word पण्य being formed by a <i>kritya</i> affix, will retain its accent in the <i>Tatpurusha</i>, by [[6.2.2]], we reply that the कृत्य used in [[6.2.2]] relates to <i>pratipadokta</i> <i>kritya</i> compounds such as ordained by कृत्यतुल्याख्या अजात्या [[2.1.68]], while here the compound is by विशेषणं विशेष्येण [[2.1.51]] and is a general compound. So also दास्याभारः = दासी꣡भारः ॥ The words belonging to <i>Dasi</i> <i>bharadi</i> class are all those <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound words, not governed by any of the rules of accent, in which it is desired that the first member should retain its accent. Some of them are देव꣡जूतिः, देव꣡सूतिः, देववीतिः, व꣡सुनीतिः ॥ <i>Vasu</i> has acute on the first being formed by a नित् affix <i>Unadi</i> l. 9 10). ओषधिः = ओषोधीयतेऽस्याम्, formed by कि affix [[3.3.93]], ओष being formed by घञ् has acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. चन्द्र꣡माः is formed by असि affix added to the root माङ् माने preceded by the <i>upapada</i> चन्द्र as, चन्द्र + मा + अस् = चन्द्रमस्, the affix being treated as डित् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 228), and चन्द्र is formed by रक affix (<i>Unadi</i> II.13) and has acute on the final.
