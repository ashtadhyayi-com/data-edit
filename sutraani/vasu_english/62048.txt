A word ending in the Instrumental -3rd case retains its accent before the Past Participle in क्त when it has a Passive meaning.
Thus अ꣡हिहतः or अहि꣡ हतः रुद्र꣡हतः, व꣡ज्रहतः, महाराज꣡हतः, नख꣡निर्भिन्ना, दा꣡त्रलूना ॥ The word '<i>ahi</i>' is derived from हन् with the proposition आ which is shortened, and the affix इण् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 138), and has acute on the final, according to others the acute is on the first: <i>Rudra</i> is formed by रक् affix (<i>Unadi</i> II.22) added to the causative रोदि; <i>Maharaja</i> is formed by the <i>Samasanta</i> affix टच्; <i>nakha</i> is formed by ख affix added to नह् (<i>Unadi</i> V. 23) or it may be a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> नास्य खमस्ति = नखः, formed by अच् [[5.4.121]], and has acute on the final : <i>Datra</i> is formed by ष्ट्रन् [[3.2.182]]. Why do we say when having a Passive signification? Observe रथेन यातः = रथयातः, the '<i>kta</i>' is added to a verb of motion with an Active significance.
