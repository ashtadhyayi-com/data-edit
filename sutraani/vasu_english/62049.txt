A word called गति -- गतिश्च [[1.4.60]], when standing immediately before a Participle in क्त having a Passive significance, retains its accent.
Thus प्र꣡कृतः, प्र꣡हृतः ॥ Here one of the following rules would have applied otherwise, namely, either (1) the <i>Samasa</i> end-acute [[4.1.223]] (2) or the Indeclinable first member to retain its accent [[6.2.2]], (3) or the end acute by [[6.2.139]] and [[6.2.144]]. The present <i>sutra</i> debars all these. Why do we say 'immediately?' Observe अभ्यु꣡द्धृतः, समु꣡द्धृतः, समुदा꣡हृतः ॥ Where the distant <i>Gati</i> words अभि and सम् do not preserve their accent, but the immediately preceding <i>Gati</i>, as उत् does retain its accent, though it is not the first member of the compound word. Compare also [[8.2.70]]. But in दूरात् + आ꣡गतः (<i>agata</i> being governed by this rule) we have to दूरादागतः꣡, [[2.5.39]] and [[6.3.2]] where [[6.2.144]] has its scope, though it had not its scope in अभि + उ꣡द्धृतः = अभ्यु꣡द्धृतः ॥ In the former case this maxim applies कृद्ग्रहणे गतिकारकपूर्वस्यापि ग्रहणं ॥ "A <i>Krit</i> affix denotes whenever it is employed, a word-form which begins with that to which that <i>Krit</i> affix has been added, and which ends with the <i>Krit</i> affix, but moreover should a <i>Gati</i> or a noun such as denotes a case-relation have been prefixed to that word-form, then the <i>Krit</i> affix must denote the same word-form together with the <i>Gati</i> or the noun which may have been prefixed to it". In the second example, this maxim is not applied, because scope should be given to the word अनन्तर in this aphorism. When the Participle has not a Passive significance, the rule does not apply because the word कर्मणि is understood here also; as, प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> debars [[6.2.144]].
