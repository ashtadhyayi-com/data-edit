An immediately preceding गति -- गतिश्च [[1.4.60]], retains its original accent before an Infinitive in तवै -- कृत्यार्थे तवैकेन्केन्यत्वनः [[3.4.14]], but whereby simultaneously the final has the acute as well.
Thus अ꣡न्वेतवै꣡, प꣡रिस्तरितवै꣡, प꣡रिपातवै꣡, अभि꣡चारितवै ॥ All <i>upasargas</i> have acute on the first except '<i>abhi</i>': which therefore has acute on the final. ( <i>Phit</i> <i>Sutra</i> IV. 13) which declares उपसर्गा आद्युदात्ता अभिवर्जम् ॥ This debars कृत् accent [[6.2.139]] and is an exception to the rule that in a single word, a single syllable only has acute.
