The word ईषत् when the first member of a compound may optionally preserve its original accent.
Thus ईष꣡त्कडारः or ईषत्कडारः꣡, ईष꣡त्पिङ्गलः or ईषत्पिङ्गलः꣡ ॥ ईष꣡त् has acute on the final. But in ईषद्भेदः &c, the <i>Krit</i>-accent will necessarily take place [[6.2.139]]; no option being allowed; because the compounds to which the present rule applies are, on the maxim of <i>pratipadokta</i>, those formed by ईषत् with non-<i>Krit</i> words under [[2.2.7]].
