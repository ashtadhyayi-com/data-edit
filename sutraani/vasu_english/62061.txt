A word having the sense of 'always' optionally retains its original accent before a Past Participle in क्त ।
Thus नि꣡त्यप्रहसितः or नित्यप्रहसितः꣡, सतत꣡प्रहसितः or सततप्रहसितः꣡ ॥ These are Accusative compounds formed under Rule [[2.1.28]]. निस्य is formed by त्यप् affix added to the <i>upasarga</i> नि [[4.2.104]] <i>Vartika</i>)); and has acute on the first, the <i>upasarga</i> retaining its accent, the affix being <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]. The word सतत being formed by क्त affix with the force of भावः, has acute on final by [[6.2.14]]. If it be considered to have been formed by कर्मणि क्त, then the accent will be on the beginning by [[6.2.49]]. Why do we say when the first term means 'always'? Observe मुहूर्त्तप्रहसितः꣡ ॥ In the case of नित्यप्रहसितः &c the <i>samasa</i> accent [[6.1.223]] was first set aside by the Accusative <i>Tatpurusha</i> accent [[6.2.2]]. this in its turn was set aside by क्त accent [[6.2.144]], which is again debarred by the present.
