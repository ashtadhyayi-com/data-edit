In the following up to -- न भूताधिकसंजीवमद्राश्मकज्जलम् [[6.2.91]], inclusive, the phrase 'the first syllable in -(the word standing in the Nominative 1st-Case) has the acute accent (उदात्त)' is always to be supplied.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> aphorism. The first syllable of the पूर्वपद will get the acute in the following aphorisms. In short, the phrase '<i>adir</i> <i>udatta</i>' should be supplied to complete the sense of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. The very next <i>sutra</i> illustrates it. That <i>sutra</i> literally means "a word in the Locative case or a word denoting the name of the receiver of a tax or tribute, standing before a word denoting that which is lawful, but not before हरण". To complete the sense we must supply the words "has acute on the first syllable". Thus स्तूपेशाणः, मुकुटे कार्षापणम्, याज्ञिकाश्वः, वैयाकरणहस्ती ॥ The word आदि 'the first syllable' is understood upto [[6.2.91]], the word उदात्त has longer stretch: it governs upto [[6.2.137]].
