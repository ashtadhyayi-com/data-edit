The word पाप is optionally acutely accented (उदात्त) on the first syllable when followed by a word denoting a professional man.
Thus पा꣡पनापितः or पापनापितः꣡, पा꣡पकुलालः or पापकुलालः꣡ ॥ This rule applies to the <i>pratipadokta</i> <i>samasa</i> of पाप in the sense of censure as taught in [[2.1.54]], when it is an appositional compound; and not when it forms a Genitive compound. Thus पापस्यनापितः = पापनापितः꣡ ॥
