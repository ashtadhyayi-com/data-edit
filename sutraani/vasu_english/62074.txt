A compound, the second member of which is a word ending in affix अक and which denotes the sport of the Eastern people, gets the acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable.
Thus उ꣡द्दालकपुष्पभञ्जिका, वी꣡रणपुष्पप्रचायिका, शा꣡लभञ्जिका, ता꣡लभञ्जिका ॥ These are formed by ण्वुल् affix [[3.3.109]], and the compounding takes place by [[2.2.17]]. Why do we say 'of the Eastern Folk'? Observe जीवपुत्रप्रचायिका, which is a sport of the Western People. Why do we say 'when denoting a sport'? Observe तवपुष्पप्रचायिका 'thy turn for &c', which is formed by ण्वुच् [[3.3.111]] and denotes 'rotation or turn'.
