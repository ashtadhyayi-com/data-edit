And when such a compound ending in अण् -affix denotes the name of a professional man, but not when the second term कार(derived from कृञ्), the acute accent (उदात्त) is on the first syllable of the first word.
Here also the second term ends in अण् affix. Thus त꣡न्तुवायः, तु꣡न्नवायः, वा꣡लवायः ॥ Why do we say when denoting 'a work-man or professional person'? Observe काण्डलावः꣡, शरलावः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'but not when the affix अण् comes after कृ'? Observe कुम्भकारः꣡, अयस्कारः꣡ ॥
