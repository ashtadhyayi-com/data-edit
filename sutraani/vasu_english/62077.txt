Also when such an उपपद compound ending in अण् -affix denotes a Name, the acute accent (उदात्त) falls on the first syllable but not when the second term is कार।
Thus त꣡न्तुवायः 'a kind of insect, spider'. वा꣡लवायः 'the hill <i>Valavaya</i>'. But not so अण् with कृ; as रथकारः꣡ 'the name of a <i>Brahmana</i> caste'.
