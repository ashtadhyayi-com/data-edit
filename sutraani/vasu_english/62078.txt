The words 1. गो 2. तन्ति and 3. यव get the acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable when followed by पाल।
Thus गो꣡पालः, त꣡न्तिपालः, य꣡वपालः ॥ The word तन्ति is the rope with which calves are tied. (तनु विस्तारे + क्तिच्). This applies to words not denoting a functionary, which would be governed by [[6.2.75]]. Why do we say गो &c? Observe वत्सपालः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'followed by पाल'? Observe गोरक्षः꣡ ॥
