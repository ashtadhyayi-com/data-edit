In a word consisting of more than two syllables followed by ज , the acute accent (उदात्त) falls on the syllable before the last.
Thus उपस꣡रजः, मन्दु꣡रजः, आमल꣡कीजः, and वड꣡वाजः (though the last two words have <i>upapadas</i> ending in long vowel, the accent is governed by this <i>sutra</i> and not the last). Why do we say "a Polysyllabic first member"? Observe दग्धजानि तृणानि ॥
