Before ग्राम the first syllable of the first member as acute accent (उदात्त) when thereby inhabitants are not meant.
Thus म꣡ल्लग्रामः, व꣡णिग्ग्रामः ॥ Here ग्राम is equal to समूह 'an assembly'. देवग्रामः = देवस्वामिकः ॥ Why do we say 'when not meaning inhabitants'. Observe दाक्षिग्रामः 'a village inhabited by the descendants of <i>Daksha</i>', माहिकग्रामः 'a village inhabited by <i>Mahikas</i>'.
