In the following sūtras up to निष्ठोपसर्गपूर्वमन्यतरस्याम् [[6.2.110]], inclusive, is to be supplied the phrase 'the last syllable in a word standing in the Nominative 1st-Case has the acute accent (उदात्त)'.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> aphorism. In the succeeding <i>sutras</i>, the last syllable of the first member of a compound gets the acute accent. Thus in the next <i>sutra</i> the word सर्व gets acute on the final. This <i>adhikara</i> extends upto [[6.2.110]] inclusive.
