The acute accent (उदात्त) is on the final of the word सर्व standing as the first member before an attributive word in the sense 'whole, through and through'.
Thus सर्व꣡श्वेतः, सर्व꣡कृष्णः, सर्व꣡महान् ॥ Why do we say सर्व? Observe परमश्वेतः, here the attribute of श्वेत pervades through and through the object referred : but the accent is not on the final of परम ॥ Why do we say 'attributive word'? Observe सर्वसौवर्णः, 'golden', सर्वरजतः 'silvery', which do not denote any attribute in their original state but modification. In fact it is not गुणकार्त्स्न्य here at all, but a विकारकार्त्स्न्य ॥ Why do we use the word '<i>Kartsnya</i> or complete pervasion'. Observe सर्वेषां श्वेततरः = सर्वश्वेतः here the compounding takes place by the elision of the affix तरप् denoting comparison, and as it shows only comparitive, not absolute, whiteness, the rule does not apply. Moreover, in this example, the "<i>kartsnya</i>" is not that of "<i>guna</i>" but of "guni", not of the 'attribute', but of the 'substance'. Objection:- How do you form such a compound सर्वेषां श्वेततरः = सर्वश्वेतः, for it is prohibited by [[2.2.11]]? Ans. We do it on the strength of the following <i>Vartika</i> गुणात्तरेण समासो वक्तव्यः, सरलोपश्च ॥
