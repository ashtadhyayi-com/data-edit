Before the word उदक when the compound denotes a mixture, the last syllable of the first member has the acute accent (उदात्त).
Thus गुडो꣡दकम् or गुडो॑दकम्, तिलो꣡दकम् or तिलो॑दकम् ॥ When we have already made the उ and ल acute by this rule, then the <i>svarita</i> accent may result optionally, by the combination of the acute अ of <i>guda</i> and <i>tila</i> and the subsequent grave उ of उदक, by Rule [[8.2.6]]. The word अकेवल in means mixture. When mixture is not meant, this rule does not apply. As शीतोदकम्, उष्णोदकम् ॥
