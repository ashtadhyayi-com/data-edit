The word विश्व has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final, being first member in a बहुव्रीहि समास , when it is a Name.
Thus विश्व꣡देवः, विश्व꣡यशाः, विश्व꣡महान् ॥ This is an exception to [[6.2.1]] by which the first member in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> would have retained its original accent. Why do we say in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound? Observe विश्वे च देवाः = विश्वदेवाः ॥ Why do we say 'when a name'? Observe विश्वेदेवा अस्य = विश्वदेवः ॥ But विश्वामित्रः꣡ and विश्वाजिनः꣡ have acute on the final, as they are governed by the subsequent rule [[6.2.165]] which supersedes this. The word <i>Bahuvrihi</i> governs the succeeding <i>sutras</i> upto [[6.2.120]] inclusive. The word विश्व is originally acute on the first, as it is formed by the affix क्वन् added to विश् ॥ This rule has unrestricted scope in विश्वदेवः, विश्वयशाः and rule [[6.2.165]] has unrestricted scope in कुलमित्रः, कुलजिनः ॥ But in विश्वामित्रः and विश्वाजिनः there is a conflict, as both these rules would apply, therefore by the maxim of <i>vipratishedha</i>, [[6.2.165]] supersedes this.
