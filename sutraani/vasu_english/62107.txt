The first member in a बहुव्रीहि समास , before the words 1. उदर 2. अश्व and 3. इषु , gets acute accent (उदात्त) on the final syllable when the compound denotes a Name.
Thus वृको꣡दरः, दामो꣡दरः, हर्य॑श्वः, यौवना꣡श्वः, सुवर्णपुङ्खे꣡षुः and महेषुः꣡ ॥ This <i>sutra</i> is also an exception to [[6.2.1]] by which the first term would have retained its original accent. The word वृ꣡क has acute on the first by <i>Phit</i> II .7. The word दा꣡म is formed by मनिन् affix (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 145) and is first acute; ह꣡रि is also first acute as formed by इन् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 118). The word यौवन if considered as an underived primitive, has acute on the first by <i>Phit</i> II.19. If it be considered as derived from युवन् with the affix अण् then it is already end-acute and would retain its accent even by [[6.2.1]]. The first <i>Bahuvrihi</i> word सुवर्ण has acute on the final by [[6.2.172]], the second <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound सुवर्णपुंखाः has acute on र्ण by [[6.2.1]], the third <i>Bahuvrihi</i> with इषु gets accent on ख ॥ The word महत is end-acute by [[5.2.38]]. Its mention here appears redundant.
