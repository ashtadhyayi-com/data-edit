A word before 1. उदर 2. अश्व and 3. इषु in a बहुव्रीहि समास gets the acute accent (उदात्त) on the final, when reproach is meant.
Thus कुण्डो꣡दरः, घटो꣡दरः, कटुका꣡श्वः, स्यन्दिता꣡श्वः, अनिघाते꣡षुः, चलाचले꣡षुः ॥ The word कु꣡ण्ड has acute on the first as it is a Neuter name (<i>Phit</i> 11.3), and it would have retained this accent in the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> by [[6.2.1]]. but for this <i>sutra</i>. The word घट is formed by अच् [[3.1.134]] and has acute on the final, and so it would have retained this accent by [[6.2.1]], even with out this <i>sutra</i>. The word क꣡टुक being formed by कन् [[5.3.75]] has acute on the first. स्यन्दित is formed by the <i>Nishita</i> affix क्त ॥ The word अनिघात being an <i>avyayibhava</i>, the first member would have retained its original accent. In this and the last <i>sutra</i>, all the acutes may optionally be changed into <i>svarita</i> by [[8.2.6]]. But अनुदरः꣡ and सूदरः꣡ have acute on the final by [[6.2.172]], which being a subsequent <i>sutra</i>, supersedes this present, so far as अन् and सु are concerned.
