In a बहुव्रीहि समास the word कर्ण standing as second member has acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable when it is preceded by a word denoting colour or mark.
Thus with color we have शुक्लक꣡र्णः, कृष्णक꣡र्ण, and with mark-name, we have दात्राक꣡र्णः शङ्कूक꣡र्णः, the lengthening of दात्र and शंकु takes place by [[6.3.115]]. The marks of 'scythe', 'arrow' &c, are made on the ears of cattle to mark and distinguish them. It is such a 'mark' which is meant here, therefore, the rule does not apply to स्थूलकर्णः ॥ Why do we say कर्ण? Observe श्वेतपादः, कूटशृङ्गः here श्वेत being formed by अच् [[2.1.134]] is end-acute, and कूट being formed by क [[3.1.135]] is also end-acute and these accents are retained in the compound. Why do we say "when preceded by a word denoting color or mark"? Observe शोभनपादः where शोभन being formed by युच् [[2.2.149]] is end-acute and this accent is retained [[6.2.1]].
