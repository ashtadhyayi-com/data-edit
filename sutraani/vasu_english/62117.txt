After the adjective सु in a बहुव्रीहि समास a stem ending in मन् and अस् with the exception of लोमन् and उषस् has acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable.
Thus सुक꣡र्म्मन्, सुध꣡र्मन्, सुप्र꣡थिमन्, सुप꣡यस्, सुय꣡शस्, सुस्रो꣡तम् so also सुस्र꣡त् and सुध्व꣡त् from the root स्रंस् and ध्वंस् with the affix क्विप् ॥ The final स् is changed to द् by [[8.2.72]]. But this substitution is considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of accent, and these words are taken as if still ending in अस् ॥ Why do we say 'after सु?' Observe कृतकर्मन्, कृतयशस् ॥ Why do we say 'ending in मन् and अस्?' Observe सुराजन् and सुतक्षन् formed by the affix कनिन् (<i>Unadi</i> I.156), and the accent is on श and त, but with सु, the accent is thrown on the final by [[6.2.172]]. Why do we say with the exception of लोमन and उषत्? Observe सुलोम꣡न and सूष꣡स् [[6.2.172]]. The following maxim applies here: अनिमस्मन् ग्रहणान्यर्थवता चानर्थकेन च तदन्तविधिं प्रयोजयन्ति "whenever अम्, or इन् or अस् or मन्, when they are employed in Grammar, denote by [[1.1.72]], something that ends with अन् or इन् or अस् or मन्, there (अन्, इन्, अस् and मन्) represent these combinations of letters, both in so far as they possess and also in so far as they are void of, a meaning". Therefore the मन् and अस् void of meaning are also included here. Thus धर्मन् is formed by मन् (<i>Unadi</i> I.140), but कर्मन् is formed by मनिन् (<i>Unadi</i>. IV. 145), and प्रथिमन् is formed by इमनिच् affix [[5.1.122]] in which मन् is only a part. Similarly यशस् is formed by असुन् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 191), and so also स्रोतस् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 202); but in सुध्व꣡स् (सुध्वम् from ध्वंस् with the affix क्विप् [[3.2.76]]) the rule applies also, though अस् is here part of the root. But when the <i>samasanta</i> affix कप् is added [[5.4.154]], then the accent falls on the syllable immediately preceding कप्, for there the subsequent Rule [[6.2.173]] supersedes the present rule: thus सुकर्म꣡कः, सुस्रोत꣡स्कः ॥
