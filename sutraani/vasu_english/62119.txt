In a बहुव्रीहि समास in the छन्दस् (Vedas) a word of two syllables with acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable when preceded by सु gets acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable.
In other words, such a word retains its accent. Thus:- स्वश्वा॒सिन्धुः॑ सु॒रथा॑ सु॒वासा॑ (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> X. 76.8). Here स्व꣡श्वः and सुर꣡थः have acute on अ and र, which they had originally also, for अश्व and रथ are formed by क्वन् (<i>Unadi</i> I.151) and क्थन् (<i>Unadi</i> II.2) respectively and have the नित् accent [[6.1.197]]. Why do we say 'having acute on the first syllable'? Observe या सु॑बा॒हुः स्व॑ङ्गुरिः (<i>Rig</i> II.32.7). Here बाहु has acute on the final (<i>Unadi</i> I.27 formed by उ affix and has the accent of the affix [[3.1.3]]). Why do we say 'having two syllables'? Observe सुगुरसत्, सुहिरण्यः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[6.2.172]].
