In a बहुव्रीहि समास in the छन्दस् (Vedas) after सु the words वीर and वीर्य have acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable.
Thus सु꣡वीरेण ते, सुवीर॑स्ते जनि॒ता (<i>Rig</i> IV. 17.4) सुवीर्यं॒स्वश्व्य॑स् (<i>Rig</i> VIII.1.36) where सु꣡वीर्य has acute on वी ॥ So also सु꣡वीर्यस्य पतयः स्याम ॥ The word वीर्य is formed by यत् affix and by [[6.1.213]], it would have acute on the first. But its enumeration in this <i>sutra</i> shows that Rule [[6.1.213]] does not apply to वीर्य ॥ The word वीर्य॑ has <i>svarita</i> on the final in the <i>Chhandas</i>, by <i>Phit</i> IV. 9. In the secular literature it is <i>adyudatta</i>.
