The word शाला at the end of a तत्-पुरुष समास when exhibited in the Neuter has acute on the first syllable.
Thus ब्राह्मणशा꣡लम्, क्षत्रियशा꣡लम् ॥ The compound becomes Neuter by [[2.4.25]]. Why do we say "in a <i>Tatpurusha</i>"? Observe दृढशाल ब्राह्मणकुलम् which is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound and therefore first member retains its accent (VI.2. I), and as the first member is a <i>Nishtha</i> word, it has acute on the final. Why do we say "the word शाला?" Observe ब्राह्मणसेनम् ॥ Why do we say 'in the Neuter'? Observe ब्राह्मणशाला ॥ Compare [[6.2.86]].
