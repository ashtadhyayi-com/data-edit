The six words - 1. काण्ड 2. चीर 3. पलल 4. सूप 5. शाक and 6. कूल of sūtras [[6.2.126]]-129 preceded by a non-living Genitive 6th-Case word have acute accent (उदात्त) on the first syllable.
As दर्भका꣡ण्डम्, शरका꣡ण्डम्; दर्भची꣡रम्, कुशची꣡रम् ॥ In the last two examples चीर is not used as a comparison, that case being governed by [[6.2.127]], तिलप꣡ललम्, मूलकशाक꣡म्, मुद्गसू꣡पः ॥ Here पलल, सूप and शाक do not denote mixing, which is governed by [[6.2.128]]. नन्दीकू꣡लम्, समुद्रकू꣡लम्, here the compound does not denote a Name, which would be the case under [[6.2.129]]. Why these 'six' only? Observe राजसूदः ॥
