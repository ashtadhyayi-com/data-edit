After शिति , a word retains in a बहुव्रीहि समास its original accent when it is always of not more than two syllables with the exception of भसद्.।
Thus शितिपा꣡दः, शित्य꣡सः, शित्यौ꣡ष्ठः ॥ The word पाद belongs to वृषादि class [[6.1.203]] and has acute on the first, and अंस and ओष्ठः being formed by सन् (<i>Unadi</i> V. 21) and थम् (<i>Unadi</i> II.4) affixes, have acute on the first [[6.1.197]]. Why do we say 'after शिति'? Observe दर्शनीयपादः which being formed by the affix अनीयर् has acute on the penultimate syllable नी by [[6.1.217]] ॥ Why do we say 'always'? Observe शि꣡तिककुत्, for though ककुत् is here of two syllables, it is an abbreviated form of ककुद, the final अ being elided in denoting condition of life [[5.4.146]], in compounds other than those denoting 'age', we have शितिककुदः, hence this word is not such which is always of two syllables. The word शिति has acute on the first syllable, by <i>Phit</i> II.10, and retains this accent in the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> [[6.2.1]]. Why do we say '<i>abahvach</i> or not many syllable'? Observe शि꣡तिललाटः ॥ Why do we say in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> ? Observe शितेः पादः = शितिपादः ॥ Why do we say 'with the exception of भसत्? Observe शि꣡तिभसत् ॥ This <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[6.2.1]].
