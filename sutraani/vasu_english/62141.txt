In a द्वन्द compound of the Names of Divinities, both the members retain their original accent.
Thus, इ꣡न्द्रासोमौ꣡, इ꣡न्द्राव꣡रुणौ, इ꣡न्द्राबृ꣡हस्पती ॥ The word इन्द्र has acute on the first (by <i>nipatana</i>), सोम is formed by मन् (<i>Unadi</i> I.140), and has acute on the first [[6.1.197]], वरुण is formed by उनन् (<i>Unadi</i> III.53) and by [[6.1.197]] has acute on the first. बृ꣡हस्प꣡ति has two acutes by [[6.2.140]], and <i>Indra</i>-<i>Brihaspati</i> has three acutes. Why do we say "names of divinities"? Observe प्लक्षन्यग्रोधौ ॥ Why do we say 'a <i>Dvandva</i>'? Observe अग्निष्टोमः ॥
