In a द्वन्द compound of the Names of Divinities, both members of the compound simultaneously do not retain their accent when the first syllable of the second word is अनुदात्त with the exception of 1.पृथिवी 2. रुद्र 3. पूष and 4. मन्थिन्।
Thus इन्द्राग्नी, इन्द्रवायू, the words <i>Agni</i> and <i>Vayu</i> have acute on the final. The word <i>uttarapada</i> is repeated in the <i>sutra</i>, in order that it should be qualified by the word '<i>anudattadau</i>', which latter would otherwise have qualified <i>Dvandva</i>. The word "<i>anudattadau</i>" shows the scope of the prohibition and the injunction. Why do we say with the exception of '<i>prithivi</i>' &c? Observe द्यावापृथिव्यौ or व्यौ <i>dvyava</i> has acute on the first, '<i>prithivi</i>' being formed by '<i>nish</i>', has acute on the final. सोमारुद्रौ, <i>Rudra</i> is formed by '<i>rak</i>' affix (<i>Unadi</i> II.22.), and has acute on the final. इन्द्रापूषणौ, <i>Pushan</i> has acute on the end. (<i>Unadi</i> I.159) शुक्रामन्थिनौ, the words <i>Sukra</i> and <i>manthin</i> have acute on the final.
