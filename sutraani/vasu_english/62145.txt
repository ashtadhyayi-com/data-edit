The Participle in क्त has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final when it is preceded by सु or by a word with which the second member is compared.
Thus सुकृत꣡म्, सुभुक्त꣡म्, सुपीत꣡म् ॥ With <i>Upamana</i> words we have - वृकावलुप्त꣡म्, शशलुत꣡म् , सिंहविनर्दित꣡म् ॥ This debars [[6.2.49]] and [[6.2.48]]. When सु is not a <i>Gati</i>, the rule does not apply, as सुस्तुत꣡म् भवता ॥
