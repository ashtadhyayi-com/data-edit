The final of Part Participles दत्त and श्रुत alone have the acute accent (उदात्त) in a compound denoting a Name and a Benediction, the preceding word being a word standing in close relation to an action (कारक)।
Thus देवा एनंदेयासुः = देवदत्तः꣡, विष्णुरेवं श्रूयाद् = विष्णुश्रुतः꣡ ॥

Why do we say "of दत्त and श्रुत"? Observe देवपालितः [[6.2.48]], which, though a Name, is not governed by [[6.2.146]], and does not take acute on the final, for the present rule makes a restriction with regard to that rule even. So that where a Participle in क्त is preceded by a <i>karaka</i>, and the compound denotes a benediction and a Name, the accent is not on the final, as required by [[6.2.146]], but such a word is governed by [[6.2.48]], unless the Participle be <i>Datta</i> and <i>sruta</i>, when the present rule applies. The word कारक indicates that the rule will not apply when a <i>gati</i> or <i>upapada</i> precedes. Why do we use 'एव (alone)'? So that the restriction should apply to '<i>karaka</i>', and not to '<i>Datta</i>' and '<i>Sruta</i>'. For the words '<i>Datta</i>' and '<i>Sruta</i>' will have acute on the final even after a non<i>karaka</i> word. As संश्रूतः꣡, विश्रूतः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'when denoting benediction'? The rule will not apply where benediction is not meant. As देवैः खाता = देवखाता ॥ This rule applies to <i>Datta</i> and <i>Sruta</i> after a <i>karaka</i>-word, only when benediction is meant. It therefore does not apply to देवद꣡त्त 'the name of <i>Arjuna</i>'s conch', as आहतोनदति देवद꣡त्तः, which is governed by [[6.2.48]].
