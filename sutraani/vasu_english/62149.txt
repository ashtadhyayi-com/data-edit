The Participle in क्त has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final when the compound denotes 'done by one in such a condition'.
The word इत्थंभूत means 'being in such a condition'. Thus सुप्तप्रलपित꣡म्, उन्मत्तप्रलपित꣡म्, प्रमत्तगीत꣡म्, विपन्नश्रुत꣡म् as Adjectives and Abstract verbal nouns. This is an exception to [[6.2.48]]. When the words प्रलपित &c are used to denote Noun of Action (भाव, then by [[6.2.144]] they get of course acute on the final.
