After a कारक as mentioned in कारकाद्दत्तश्रुतयोरेवाशिषि [[6.2.148]], the second member ending in the affix अन and denoting an action in the Abstract or the object (i.e. having the senses of Passive Adjective), has the acute accent (उदात्त) on the final.
Thus ओदनभोजनं꣡ सुखम्, पयपानं꣡ सुखम्, चन्दनप्रियङ्गुकालेपनं꣡ सुखम् ॥ All these are examples of भाव or Abstract Verbal Nouns. राजभोजनाः꣡ शालयः, राजाच्छादनानि꣡ वासांसि, are examples of कर्मवचन or Passive Adjectives. These are formed by ल्युट् under [[3.3.116]]. For the <i>Sutra</i> [[3.3.116]] may be explained by saying that (1) ल्युट् is applied when the <i>Upapada</i> is in the objective case and <i>bhava</i> is meant, (2) as well as when object is to be expressed. When the first explanation is taken, the above are examples of <i>Bhava</i>; when the second explanation is taken, they are examples pf <i>Karma</i>. Why do we say "ending in अन्"? Observe, हस्तहा॑र्यमुदश्चित् ॥ Why do we say "when expressing an action in the abstract (<i>bhava</i>), or an Object (<i>karma</i>)"? Observe दन्तधाव꣡नम्, here ल्युट् is added after an Instrumental <i>karaka</i> [[3.3.117]]. Why do we say "after a <i>karaka</i>"? Observe निदर्श꣡नम्, अवलेख꣡नम् ॥ In all the counter-examples, the second members retain their original accent.
