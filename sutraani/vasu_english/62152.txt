The word पुण्य has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final when preceded by a Noun in the Locative -7th case.
Thus अध्ययने पुण्यम् = अध्ययनपुण्य꣡म्, वेदपुण्य꣡म् ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.1.40]] by the process of splitting the <i>sutra</i> (<i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i>), taking सप्तमी there as a full <i>sutra</i>, and शौण्डैः another. Here by [[6.2.2]], the first member would have preserved its accent, the present <i>sutra</i> supersedes that and ordains acute on the final. The word पुण्य is derived by the <i>Unadi</i> affix यत् (<i>Unadi</i> V. 15) and would have retained its natural accent [[6.1.213]] and thus get acute on the first syllable by <i>krit</i>-accent. [[6.2.139]]. Why do we say 'a locative case'? Observe वेदेन पुण्यं = वेदपुण्यम् ॥
