The acute accent (उदात्त) falls on the final of words having the sense of ऊन and of कलह when they are second members in a compound, preceded by a term in the Instrumental -3rd case.
Thus माषोन꣡म्, कार्षापणोन꣡म्, मासविकल꣡म्, कार्षापणविकल꣡म्, असिकलहः꣡, वाक्कलहः꣡ ॥ The compounding takes place by [[2.1.31]]. This is an exception to [[6.2.2]] by which the first member being in the third case, would have retained its original accent, Some say that the word अर्थ in the <i>sutra</i> means the word-form अर्थ, so that the aphorism would mean - "after an Instrumental case, the words ऊन, अर्थ, and कलह get acute on the final". The examples will be in addition to the above:- धान्येनार्थाः = धान्यार्थः꣡ ॥ If this be so, then the word-form ऊन alone will be taken and not its synonyms like विकल &c. To this we reply, that ऊन will denote its synonyms also, by the fact of its being followed by the word अर्थ ॥ By <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.31]], ऊनार्थ and कलह [[2.1.57]] always take the Instrumental case, so we could have omitted the word तृतीयायाः, from this <i>sutra</i>, for by the maxim of <i>pratipadokta</i> &c, ऊनार्थकलहं would have referred to the compound ordained by [[2.1.31]]. The mention of तृतीया here is only for the sake of clearness.
