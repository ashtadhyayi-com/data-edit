A word formed with the कृत् affixes अच् and क preceded by the particle नञ् has the acute accent (उदात्त) on the final when the meaning is 'not capable'.
Thus अपचः꣡ = य पक्तुं न शक्नोति, so also अजयः꣡, अपठः꣡, अविक्षिपः꣡, अविलिखः꣡ [[3.1.134]] &c)). Why do we say when meaning 'not capable'? Observe अपचो दीक्षितः, अपचः परिव्राजकः ॥ A दीक्षित and a परिव्राजक do not cook their food, not because they are physically incapable of cooking, but because by the vows of their particular order they are prohibited from cooking.
