A word formed by the कृत् affixes अच् and क preceded by a Negative Particle have an acute accent (उदात्त) on the final when one abuses somebody by that word.
Thus अपचो꣡ऽयं जाल्मः 'this rogue does not cook, though he can do so'. Here avarice is indicated, the fellow wants more pay before he will cook : and not his incapacity. So also अपठोऽयं जाल्मः, so also अविक्षिपः꣡, अविलिखः꣡ ॥
