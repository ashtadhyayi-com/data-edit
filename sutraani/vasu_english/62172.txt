In a बहुव्रीहि समास formed by the negative particle नञ् or by सु has the acute accent (उदात्त) on the last syllable of the compound.
Thus अयवो꣡ देशः, अव्रीहिः꣡, अमाषः꣡, सुयवः꣡, सुव्रीहिः꣡, सुमाषः꣡ ॥ The acute here rests on the last syllable of the completed compound; so that the rule applies to the compounds which have fully developed themselves by taking the <i>samasanta</i> affixes. Thus अनृचः꣡ (formed by the <i>samasanta</i> affix अ [[5.4.74]]). Though the word समास and उत्तरपद are both present here by context, yet the operation is performed on <i>samasa</i>. This is to be inferred, because of the next <i>sutra</i>. For had the present <i>sutra</i> meant that the final of the second member (उत्तरपद) preceded by नञ् and सु gets the acute, then there would have been no necessity of the next <i>sutra</i>, for the present would have covered the case of सुकुमारीक &c because कप् is not a part of the second term (<i>uttarapada</i>) कुमारी but of the compound (<i>Samasa</i>) सुकुमारी; and therefore, if we translated the present <i>sutra</i>, by saying that the end of second term gets acute, the accent would have fallen on ई in सुकुमारीकः even by this <i>sutra</i>. But this is not intended, because of the accent of the <i>samasanta</i> words अनृचः and बह्वृचः ॥ There is necessity of the next <i>sutra</i>, because a <i>samasa</i> includes not only the simple <i>samasa</i>, but one ending with a <i>samasanta</i> affix. Therefore, had not the next <i>sutra</i> been made, the accent would have fallen on क and not on ई, for the affix कप् is considered part of the <i>samasa</i> and not of the <i>uttarapada</i> समासान्तः समासस्यैवावयवः नोत्तरपदस्य ॥
