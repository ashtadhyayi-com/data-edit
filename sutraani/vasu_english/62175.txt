A बहुव्रीहि समास with बहु has the same accent as नञ् when it denotes muchness of the object expressed by the second member.
In other words a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> with the word बहु in the first member, is governed by all those rules which apply to a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> with a Negative Particle such as Rules [[6.2.172]] &c. when this gives the sense of multiety of the objects denoted by the second member. Thus बहुयवा꣡ देशः, बहुव्रीहिः꣡, बहुतिलः꣡ the same as [[6.2.172]]. बहुय꣡वकः, बहुव्री꣡हिकः, बहुमा꣡षकः by [[6.2.174]]. बहुज꣡रः, बहुम꣡रः, बहुमि꣡त्रः, बहुमृ꣡तः by [[6.2.116]]: these examples of [[6.2.116]] are not given by Dr. Bohtlingk.

Why do we say '<i>uttara</i>-<i>pada</i>-<i>bhumni</i>-when multiety of the objects denoted by the second member is meant'? Observe बहुषु मनोऽस्य = बहु꣡मना अयम् [[6.2.1]].
