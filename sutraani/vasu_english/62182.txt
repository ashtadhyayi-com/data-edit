After परि a word which expresses something which has both this side and that side, as well as the word मण्डल has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final.
Thus परिकूल꣡म्, परितीर꣡म्, परिमण्डल꣡म् ॥ This is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> or प्रादि compound or an <i>Avyayibhava</i>. If it is an <i>Avyayibhava</i>, then rule [[6.2.33]] is superseded, and the first member does not retain its original accent. अभितः = उभयतः 'on both sides', अभितोभावोऽस्यास्ति = अभितोभाविन् 'that which has both sides': namely those things which have naturally two sides such as 'banks', 'shores' &c.
