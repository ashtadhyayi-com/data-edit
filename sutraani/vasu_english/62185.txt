The word मुख has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final when preceded by अभि।
As, अभिमुख꣡म् ॥ It is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> or a प्रादि <i>samasa</i>. If it is an <i>Avyayibhava</i>, then it would have acute on the final by [[6.1.223]] also. By [[6.2.177]], even मुख would have oxytone after an <i>upasarga</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> makes the additional declaration that मुख is oxytone even when the compound is not a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, when it does not denote an indispensable part of body, or a part of body even, as was the case in [[6.2.177]]. Thus अभिमुखा꣡ शाला ॥
