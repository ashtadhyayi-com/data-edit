The word मुख has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final after the preposition अप्।
Thus अपमुख꣡म्, अपमुखः꣡ ॥ The compound is in one case <i>Avyayibhava</i> also, when rule [[6.2.33]] will be superseded. The separation of this from the last <i>sutra</i>, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorism, in which the <i>anuvritti</i> of अप only goes.
