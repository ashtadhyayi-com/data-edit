After अधि that word which denotes that thing which overlaps or stands upon has the acute accent (उदात्त) on the final.
Thus अधिदन्तः꣡ = दन्तस्योपरि योऽन्योदन्तो जायते 'a tooth that grows over another tooth'.अधिकर्णः꣡, अधिकेशः꣡ ॥ These are प्रादि <i>samasa</i> or an appositional compound in which the second member has been dropped. Why do we say when meaning 'standing upon'? Observe अधिक꣡रणम् Here the acute is on क, the <i>krit</i>-formed second member retaining its accent [[6.2.139]].
