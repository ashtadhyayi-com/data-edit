After अनु a word which is not the Principal as well as कनीयस् has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final.
The word अप्रधान means a word which stands in a dependant relation in a compound. Thus अनुगतो ज्येष्ठम् = अनुज्येष्ठः꣡, अनुमध्यमः꣡ ॥ These are प्रादि <i>samasa</i> in which the first member is the principal or <i>Pradhana</i>. अनुगतः कनीयान् = अनुकनीया꣡म्, here the second member is the Principal: the word कनीयस् is taken as प्रधान ॥ Had it been non-<i>pradhana</i>, it would be covered by the first portion of the <i>sutra</i>, and there would have been no necessity of its separate enumeration. Why do we say "अप्रधान"? Observe अनुगतो ज्येष्ठः = अनुज्येष्ठः, where ज्येष्ठ is the Principal.
