After अति , a word not formed by a कृत् affix and the word पद have acute accent (उदात्त) on the last syllable.
Thus अत्यङ्कुशो꣡ नागः, अतिकशो꣡ऽश्वः, अतिपदा꣡ शक्वरी ॥ Why do we say 'non <i>krit</i>-word and पद'? Observe अतिकारकः ॥

Vart:- The rule is restricted to those compounds in which a root has been elided. That is, when in analysing the compound a verb like क्रम् is to be employed to complete the sense. Therefore it does not apply to शोभनी गार्ग्यः = अतिगार्ग्यः ॥ But it would apply to अतिकारुकः, which when analysed becomes equal to अतिक्रान्तः कारुम् ॥
