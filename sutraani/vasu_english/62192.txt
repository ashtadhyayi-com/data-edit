After नि the second member has the acute accent (उदात्त) on the last syllable when the sense is of 'not laying down'.
The word निधानं = अप्रकाशता 'not making manifest'. Thus निमूल꣡म्, न्यक्ष꣡म्, नितृण꣡म् ॥ These are either <i>Bahuvrihi</i> or <i>pradisamasa</i>. In the case of their being <i>Avyayibhava</i>, they would have acute on the final by [[6.1.223]]. Why do we say when meaning 'not laying down'? Observe निवाक् = निहितवाक् as निवाग्वृषलः; निदण्डः = निहितदण्डः ॥ The force of नि is that of निधान here.
