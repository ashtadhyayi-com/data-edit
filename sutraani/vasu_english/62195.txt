After सु the second member has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final in a तत्-पुरुष समास when reproach is meant, in spite of the addition of सु which denotes praise.
Thus इह खल्विदानीं, सुस्थण्डिले सुस्फिताभ्यां सुप्रत्यवसितः꣡ ॥ The word सु here verily denotes praise, but it is the sense of the whole sentence that indicates reproach or censure. Why do we say "after सु"? Observe कुब्राह्मणः ॥ Why 'when reproach is meant'? Observe शोभनेषु तृणेषु = सुतृणेषु ॥
