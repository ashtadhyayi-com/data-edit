The word सक्थ has acute accent (उदात्त) on the final optionally when preceded by any word other than what ends in क्र।
The word सक्थ is the <i>samasanta</i> form of सक्थि [[5.4.113]]. Thus गौरसक्थः꣡ or गौर꣡सक्थः, श्लक्ष्णसक्थः꣡ or श्लक्ष्ण꣡सक्थः The word गौर being formed by प्रज्ञादि अण् and श्लक्ष्ण by कस्न (<i>Unadi</i> III.19) are both end-acute. Why 'not after a word ending in क्र'? Observe चक्रसक्थः꣡ which is always oxytone as it is formed by षच् [[5.4.113]] a चित् affix.
