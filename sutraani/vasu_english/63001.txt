In the following sūtras up to विभाषा स्वसृपत्योः [[6.3.24]], inclusive, is always to be supplied the phrase 'the elision does not take place before the second member of the compound'.
The words अलुक् 'there is no elision', and उत्तरपदे "before the second member" are to be supplied in the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. Both these words govern the <i>sutras</i> upto [[6.3.24]], jointly; while उत्तरपदे extends further upto that point whence commences the jurisdiction of अङ्ग [[6.4.1]]. Thus <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.2]] says "the affixes of the Ablative after '<i>stoka</i>' &c". The present <i>sutra</i> should be read there to complete the sense, e. g. "the affixes of the Ablative after <i>stoka</i> &c are not elided before the second member of the compound". Thus स्तोकात् मुक्तः = स्तोकान्मुक्तः, अल्पान्मुक्तः ॥ Why do we say "before the second member"? Observe निष्क्रान्तः स्तोकात् = निःस्तोकः ॥ The maxim of <i>pratipadokta</i> does not apply here.
