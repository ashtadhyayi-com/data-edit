The Locative -7th case-affix is optionally not elided after a word ending in a consonant or अ before बन्ध।
Thus हस्तबन्धः or हस्तबन्धः, चक्रेबन्धः or चक्रबन्धः ॥ This declares an option, with regard to the last rule, in a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> when the first member is a स्वाङ्ग word, and also it is an option to [[6.3.19]], when the compound is a <i>Tatpurusha</i>, whether the first be स्वांग or not. The word बन्धः is घञ् formed word. When the first member ends in a vowel (other than अ), the rule does not apply. As गुप्तिबन्धः ॥
