The Locative -7th case-affix ending is optionally retained after a word denoting time ending in a consonant or अ when तरप् or तमप् or the word काल or the affix तन follow.
The affixes त॒र॒ and त॒म॒ are called घ [[1.1.22]]. Thus घ :- पूर्वाह्णतरे or पूर्वाह्णेतरे, पूर्वाह्णेतमे or पूर्वाह्णतमे ॥ काल :- पूर्वाह्णेकाले or पूर्वाह्णकाले ॥ तन :- पूर्वाह्णेतने or पूर्वाह्णतमे ॥ Why do we say 'after a time-name'? Observe शुक्लतरे, शुक्लतमे ॥ The condition that the preceding word should end in a consonant or अ applies here also. Thus no option is allowed in रात्रितरायाम् ॥

As a general maxim, an affix denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added, and ends with the affix itself (प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहितस्तदादे स्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम्) ॥ Thus the word थ, अथ &c in [[6.2.144]] means a word ending in थ affix &c. But in this chapter, so far as the jurisdiction of उत्तरपदे goes, an affix does not denote a word-form ending in that affix, on the following maxim : उत्तरपदाधिकारे प्रत्ययग्रहणे न तदन्त ग्रहणम्; on the contrary the affix denotes its own-form. Thus तर, तम and तन here do not denote a word ending in these affixes. This rule we infer from the fact that in <i>sutra</i> [[6.3.50]], the author declares "हृद् is the substitute of हृदय when the word लेख, and the affixes यत्, अण्, and लास follow". Had the affix अण् here meant the word-form ending in अण्, then there would have been no necessity of using the word लेख in the <i>sutra</i>, as लेख is formed with the अण् affix. The word काल in the aphorism means the word-form काल ॥ See <i>Sutra</i> [[4.3.23]] for the affix तन ॥
