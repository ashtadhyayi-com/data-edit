The Locative -7th case ending is not preserved before a stem ending in इन् before he word सिद्ध and before a word derived from बन्ध् ।
Thus स्थण्डिलशायिन्, सांकाश्यसिद्धः, काम्पिल्यसिद्धः, चक्रबन्धकः, चरकबन्धकः ॥ The compounding takes place by <i>yoga</i>-<i>vibhaga</i> of <i>sutra</i> [[2.1.40]]. Some use the word चक्रबन्धः as an illustration under this rule: बन्ध then is derived by अच् of [[3.1.134]]. The बन्ध ending in घञ् is governed by [[6.3.13]]. This <i>sutra</i> is an exception to [[6.3.14]].
