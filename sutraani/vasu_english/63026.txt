The आनङ् is the substitute for the final of the first member in a द्वन्द समास of the names of the देवता-s.
Thus इन्द्रावरुणौ, इन्द्रासोमौ, इन्द्राबृहस्पती, मित्रावरुणौ ॥ The repetition of the word <i>Dvandva</i> in this <i>sutra</i>, in spite of its <i>anuvritti</i> from the last, shows that the rule applies only to such <i>Dvandvas</i> which are generally found in the Vedas and are well-known. It does not apply to compounds like ब्रह्मप्रजापति, शिववैश्रवणौ ॥ In fact it applies to the <i>Dvandva</i> of those <i>Devatas</i> whose companionship is well-known.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated with regard to वायु in both cases, whether first or last, as अग्निवायू or वाय्वग्नी ॥
