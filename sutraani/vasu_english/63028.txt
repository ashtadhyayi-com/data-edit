The short इ is the substitute of the final of the अग्नि in such a द्वन्द समास in which both the members take the वृद्धि।
Thus आग्निवारुणी, which would have required long ई by the last rule: आग्निमारुतम्, which would have required आनङ् by [[6.3.26]]. Thus आग्निवारुणीमनड्वाहीमालभेत, आग्निमारुतं कर्म क्रियेत ॥ आग्नीमरुतौ देवताऽस्य [[4.2.24]], takes the <i>Taddhita</i> affix, and by [[7.3.21]], both members of the compound take <i>Vriddhi</i>. When both members do not take <i>Vriddhi</i>, the rule does not apply: as आग्नेन्द्रः (आग्न इन्द्र) because इन्द्र does not take <i>Vriddhi</i>, by [[7.3.22]].

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated when the word विष्णु follows : as आग्नावैष्णवं चरुं निर्वपेत् ॥
