The feminine ङी (ई) added to a word formed by a तद्धित affix having an indicatory उ or ऋ is optionally shortened before the घ etc. -- घरूपकल्पचेलड्ब्रुवगोत्रमतहतेषु ङ्योऽनेकाचो ह्रस्वः [[6.3.43]].
Thus श्रेयसितरा or श्रेयसीतरा, or श्रेयस्तरा, विदुषितरा or विदुषीतरा or विद्वत्तरा ॥ The first is formed by the <i>Taddhita</i> affix ईयसुन्, and the second by क्वसु ॥ In one alternative, there is masculisation also when we get the forms श्रेयस्तरा &c. Or this latter form may be considered to have been evolved from श्रेयस्, to which is added the affixes denoting comparison, and then the feminine affix, in denoting a feminine.
