पद् is substituted for पाद before 1. आजि 2. आति 3. ग and 4. उपहत।
Thus पदाजिः = पादाभ्यामजति; पदातिः = पादाभ्यामतति ॥ आजिः and आतिः are formed by इण् from अज् and अत् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 131), and irregularly अज् is not changed to वी though required by [[2.4.56]]; before this affix. So also पदगः = पादाभ्यां गच्छति; पदोपहतः = पादेनोपहतः ॥ पाद belongs to <i>Vrishadi</i> class [[6.1.203]] and has therefore acute on the first syllable, the पद् substitute however has acute on the final, only in the उपदेश [[6.1.171]], therefore in पदोपहतः, पद् retains its accent [[6.2.48]], and it becomes acute on the final. While पदाजिः, पदातिः and पदगः have acute on the final [[6.1.223]] and <i>krit</i>-accent)).
