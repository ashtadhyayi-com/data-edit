उद is substituted for उदक when the compound is a Name.
Thus उदमेघः 'a person called <i>Udamegha</i>', उदवाहः "a person named <i>Udavahah</i>." The well-known Patronymics from these are औदमेघिः and औदवाहिः ॥ Why do we say 'when it is a Name'? Observe उदकगिरिः ॥

Vart:- उद is the substitute for उदक when it stands as the second member of a compound and denotes a Name: as, लोहितोदः, नीलोदः, क्षीरोदः ॥
