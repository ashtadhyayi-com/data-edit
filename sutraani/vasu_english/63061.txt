According to the opinion of गालव a short vowel is substituted in a compound before the second member for the long इक् vowels (ई , ऊ , ॠ) unless it is the long vowel of the feminine affix ई (ङी).
In other words, for ई, when it is not the Feminine affix ई (ङी) and for ऊ, a short इ and उ are substituted in a compound before the second member. Thus ग्रामणिपुत्रः or ग्रामणीपुत्रः, ब्रह्मबन्धुपुत्रः or ब्रह्मबन्धूपुत्रः ॥ Why do we say इक् vowels? Observe खट्वापादः, मालापादः ॥ Why do we say 'not the long ई of the Feminine affix ङी'? Observe गार्गीपुत्रः, वात्सीपुत्रः ॥ The name of <i>Galava</i> is mentioned <i>pujartha</i> for the <i>anuvritti</i> of 'optionally' was present in this <i>sutra</i>. It is a limited option <i>pujartha</i>, (<i>vyavasthita</i> <i>vibhasha</i>), and does not apply to कारीषगन्धीपति &c which are governed by [[6.3.139]].

Vart:- It does not apply to <i>Avyayibhava</i> compounds, nor to those words which take इयङ् or उवङ् augment in their declension, as श्रीकुलम्, भ्रूकुलम्, काण्डीभूतम्, कुडपीभूतं, वृषलीभूतम् ॥

Vart:- It does however apply to भ्रुकुंस &c, as भ्रुकुंसः, भ्रुकुटिः ॥ Others say अ is substituted for भ्र &c as भ्रकुंसः and भ्रकुटिः ॥
