A short is always substituted for the final of the first member when the second member is a word formed by an affix having an indicatory ख but not when the first member is an indeclinable.
Thus कालिंमन्या, हरिणिंमन्या ॥ The augment मुम् does not prevent the shortening, had it done so, the rule would have been unnecessary. But दोषामन्यमहः, दिवामन्यारात्रिः, where दोषा and दिवा are Indeclinables there is no shortening. The above words are formed by खश् [[3.2.83]]. The phrase <i>anavyayasya</i> indicates by implication that the word खित् here means खिदन्तः, contrary to the maxim enunciated in [[6.3.17]] उत्तरपदाधिकारे प्रत्ययग्रहणे तदन्तविधिर्नेष्यते ॥ For an <i>Avyaya</i> can never take a खित् affix which are ordained only after <i>dhatus</i>.
