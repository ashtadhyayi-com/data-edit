मुम् is the augment added immediately after the final vowel of अरुस , द्विषत् and of a stem ending in a vowel unless it is an indeclinable, when the word formed by a खित् affix follows.
Thus अरुन्तुदः, द्विषन्तपः, कालिंमन्या &c. See [[3.2.35]], [[3.2.39]], [[3.2.83]]. The स् of अरुस् and the त् of द्विषत् are dropped by [[8.2.23]].

Why do we say 'of अरुस् &c'? Observe विद्वन्मन्या ॥ Why do we say 'not an Indeclinable'? Observe दोषामन्यमहः, दिवामन्यारात्रिः ॥ Why do we use the word अन्त in अजन्त, when merely saying अचः would have sufficed by the rule of <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i>? This indicates that the shortening taught in the preceding <i>sutra</i> does not debar the मुम् augment, nor does मुम् debar the shortening. So that मुम् is added after the shortening has taken place.
