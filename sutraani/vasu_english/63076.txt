The Negative Particle remains unchanged in a word which begins with एक and of this एक there is the augment अदुक् (अद्)।
Thus एकेन न विंशतिः = एकान्नविंशतिः, एकान्नत्रिंशत् ॥ These are Instrumental compounds. The augment आदुक् is added to the final of the first member, so that we have optionally two forms एकात् न विंशतिः and एकान् न विंशति by [[8.4.45]].
