स is substituted for सह when it has the sense of 'up to the end'.
Thus सकलं = कलान्तं ज्योतिषमधीते ॥ So also समुहूर्तम् = (मुहूर्तान्तम्) ॥ स संग्रह (= संग्रहान्तम्) व्याकरणमधीते ॥ These are all <i>Avyayibhava</i> compounds by अन्तवचने [[2.1.6]]. Therefore, when a word, denoting time, is the second member, सह would not be changed to स, because of the prohibition in [[6.3.81]]. The present <i>sutra</i> removes that prohibition by anticipation, with regard to time-denoting words even, when the meaning is that 'of the end of a book'. When the sense is that of 'more', we have सद्रोणाखारी, समाषः कार्षापणः सकाकिणीको माषः ॥
