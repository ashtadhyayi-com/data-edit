स is substituted for समान् before ब्रह्मचारिन् when it denotes persons engaged in fulfilling a common vow of studying the Vedas.
Thus समानो ब्रह्मचारी = सब्रह्मचारी ॥ ब्रह्म means the Vedas. The vow of studying the <i>Veda</i>, is also called ब्रह्म ॥ He who is engaged in the performance of that vow is called ब्रह्मचारिन् ॥ समान refers to the vow, the vow of studying being common to both : i. e. समाने ब्रह्मणि व्रतचारी = सब्रह्मचारी ॥ According to <i>Bhattoji</i> <i>Dikshit</i> चरणे in the <i>sutra</i> means a शाखा or a department of Vedic study. He who has a common (<i>samana</i>) branch (<i>charana</i>) is a <i>sabrahmchari</i>.
