In the room of the last consonant that follows it, of a pronoun and of the words विषवक् and देव is substituted अद्रि when अञ्च् with the affix व follows.
Thus विष्वगञ्चति = विष्वद्र्यङ्, This form is thus evolved. अञ्च + क्विन् = अञ्च् + ० = अञ्च् + नुम् [[7.1.70]] Then there is elision of the final conjunct consonant ऊच्, then the final dental is changed to guttural because of the क्विन् affix [[8.2.62]], i. e. न् is changed to ङ् and we have अङ् which with विष्वद्रि gives the above form. देवद्र्यङ्, तद्र्यङ्, यद्र्यङ् ॥ अद्रि and सध्रि [[6.3.95]] have acute on the final irregularly (<i>nipatan</i>) in order to prevent the <i>krit</i>-accent, and when इ is changed into य् the following vowel becomes <i>svarita</i> [[8.2.4]]. Why do we say of विष्वग् and देव? Observe अश्वाची = अश्वमञ्चति, the feminine ङीप् being added by [[4.1.6]] <i>Vartika</i> The अ of अच् is elided by [[6.4.138]] and the final of अश्व is lengthened by [[6.3.138]]. Why 'when अञ्च् follows'? Observe विष्वग्युक् ॥ Why do we say 'when the affix व् follows'? Observe विष्वगञ्चनं ॥ The व is totally elided by [[6.1.67]]. Another reading of the <i>sutra</i> is अप्रत्यये (अञ्चतावप्रत्यये). It would give the same result, the meaning then being when no affix follows. The word वप्रत्यये or अप्रत्यये indicates by implication that in other places where simply a verb is mentioned, it means a word-form beginning with that verb which ends with some affix. For had अप्रत्यये not been used, then the rule would have applied not only when <i>anch</i> followed, but when <i>anchana</i> ending in ल्युट् also followed. The maxim धातुग्रहणे तदादि विधिरिष्यते is illustrated in अयस्कृतं and अयस्कारः; for [[8.3.46]] teaches that <i>visarga</i> is changed into स् when कृ follows. There the कृ denotes not only the root कृ but a word derived from कृ, therefore which begins with कृ, such as कारः and कृतः ॥ Therefore the rule applies to forms like अयस्कृत् which is followed merely by the verb कृ; as well as to forms like अयस्कृतः ॥

Vart:- In the Vedas, diversely before the feminine nouns: thus in "विश्वाची व घृताची च" there is no substitution in विश्वाची, but in कद्रीची there is this substitution. कद्रीची is derived from किम् + अञ्च् = कद्रि + अञ्च् ॥ Then is added ङीप् and then like अश्वाची ॥
