तिरि is substituted for तिरस् before this अञ्च् when no affix (or व affix) follows, provided that the अ of अञ्च् is not elided.
Thus तिर्यङ्, तिर्यञ्चौ, तिर्यञ्चः ॥ Why do we say 'when there is no elision'? Observe तिरश्चा, तिरश्चे ॥ Here अ is elided by [[6.4.138]]. The word अलोपे in the <i>sutra</i> is ambiguous. It may mean either (1) "where अ is elided" or (2) "Where there is no elision". The latter meaning should be taken however.
