After 1. द्वि 2. अन्तर and prepositions, long ई is the substitute of अप्।
By [[1.1.54]], ई replaces the first-letter of अप् viz अ only. Thus द्वीपः, अन्तरीपः, नीपम्, वीपम्, समीपम् ॥ The <i>samasanta</i> अ is added by [[5.4.74]].

Vart:- Prohibition should be stated with regard to समाप ॥ समापं नाम देवयजनम् ॥ Others say after a Preposition in अ, the long ई substitution does not take place. Thus प्रापम्, परापम् ॥ The word <i>upasarga</i> strictly speaking denotes adverbs, and cannot be applied to nouns like अप्; here however, this word is used in a loose sense in the <i>sutra</i>. It means प्र &c.
