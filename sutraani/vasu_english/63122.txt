The final vowel of a preposition is diversely lengthened before a word formed by the कृत् affix घञ् but not when the compound denotes a human being.
Thus नीक्लेदः, वीमार्गः, अपामार्गः ॥ It does not take place, as प्रसेचः, प्रसारः ॥ It is lengthened before साद and कार, when building is meant, as प्रासादः and प्राकारः, otherwise प्रसादः and प्रकारः ॥ Optionally in वेश &c. as प्रतिवेशः or प्रतीवेशः, प्रतिरोधः or प्रतीरोधः ॥ When human beings are meant, there is no lengthening, as निपादो मनुष्यः ॥
