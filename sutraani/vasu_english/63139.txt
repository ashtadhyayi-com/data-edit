The vowel substituted for a semi-vowel is lengthened when it stands as the first member of a compound.
As कारीषगन्धीपुत्रः, कारीषगन्धीपतिः, कौमुदगन्धीपतिः ॥ See [[6.1.13]]. करीषस्येव गन्धोऽस्य = करीषगन्धिः (इ being added as <i>samasanta</i> by [[5.4.136]] and [[5.4.137]]). The optional shortening ordained by [[6.3.61]] does not apply here, for that option is a definite and restricted option; moreover, on the maxim of परत्व, 'a subsequent rule superseding a precedent,' rule [[6.3.61]] is superseded by [[6.3.139]]; and the rule [[6.3.61]] can not be revived by the maxim पुनः प्रसङ्ग विज्ञानं "occasionally the formation of a particular form is accounted for by the fact that a preceding rule is allowed to apply again, after it had previously been superseded, by a subsequent rule." For here the following maxim will prevent the revival सकृद्गता विप्रतिषेधे यद्बाधितं तद्बाधितमेव "when two rules, while they apply simultaneously, mutually prohibit each other, that rule of the two which is once superseded by the other, is superseded altogether, and cannot, therefore, apply again, after the latter rule has taken effect."
