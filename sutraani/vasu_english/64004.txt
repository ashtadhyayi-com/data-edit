The finals of तिसृ and चतसृ are not lengthened before नाम् (having the augment नुट्).
As तिसृणाम्, चतसृणाम् ॥ The very fact of this prohibition proves by implication that the final ऋ of these words is not changed to र before a genitive plural, [[7.2.100]] notwithstanding. In fact नुट् is added before scope is given to that rule, and thus the preceding rule [[7.1.54]] prevents the application of the subsequent rule [[7.2.100]].
