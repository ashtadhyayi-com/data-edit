In a अङ्ग (stem) ending in न् the preceding vowel is lengthened in strong cases with the exception of the Vocative Case singular.
As राजा, राजानौ, राजानः, राजानम्, राजानौ ॥ So also सामानि तिष्ठन्ति ॥ राजा was राजान्स्, the स् was elided by [[6.1.68]], and म् by [[8.2.7]]. Why do we say 'in strong cases'? Observe राजनि (Locative Singular); सामनि (Locative Singular). Why do we say 'but not in the Vocative Singular'? Observe हे राजन् ! हे तक्षन् !
