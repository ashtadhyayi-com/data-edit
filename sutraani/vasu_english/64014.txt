In the Nominative 1st-Case singular (with the exception of the Vocative Case singular) the penultimate vowel is lengthened in a अङ्ग (stem) ending in अतु and अस् when the consonant (अस्) does not belong to a root.
Thus भवान् (with डवतुप् <i>Unadi</i> 1.63 from भा to shine), कृतवान् (with क्तवतु); गोमान् and यवमान् (with मतुप्) ॥ The नुम् (न्) is added to the above by [[7.1.70]], after the elongation has taken place, for if added before elongation, the vowel no longer being penultimate, will not be lengthened at all. अस् :-as सुपयाः, सुयशाः, सुश्रोताः ॥ Why do we say 'not belonging to a <i>dhatu</i>'? Observe पिण्डग्रः where स् belongs to the root ग्रस् (पिण्डं ग्रसते), so also चर्मवः (चर्म वस्ते)॥ The अस् having no significance as an affix &c is also included here, on the strength of the maxim "whenever अम् or इन् or अस् or मम्, when they are taught in Grammar denote by [[1.1.72]], something that ends with these, there they represent these combinations of letters both in so far as they possess, and also in so far as they are void of a meaning". (अनिनस्मन् ग्रहानि अर्थवता चानर्थकेन च तदन्तविधिं प्रयोजयन्ति) ॥ The word अन्त in the <i>sutra</i> indicates whatever ends in अतु whether when first enunciated (उपदेश), such as डवतु, क्तवतु &c, or which assumes the form अतु in grammatical inflection, such as मतुप् which in <i>upadesa</i> ends in अतुप्, but becomes अतु in प्रयोग or application. In Vocative singular we have हे गोमन्, हे सुपयः this rule not applying there.
