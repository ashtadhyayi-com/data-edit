The lengthening of the vowel takes place in the case of a अङ्ग (stem) ending in a vowel, as well as of हन् and गम् when the Desiderative affix सन् being झलादि (i.e. not taking the augment इट्) follows.
Thus of roots ending in vowel we have :- विवीषति, तुष्टूषति, चिकीर्षति, जिहीर्षति [[7.1.100]]; of हन् and गम्, जिघांसति, and अधिजिगांसते ॥

Vart:- The rule applies to that गम् which is the substitute of इङ् [[2.4.48]] 'to study'. Therefore, not here, संजिगंसते वत्सो मात्रा (cf. [[7.2.58]]); In the <i>Veda</i> we read स्वर्गे लोकं समजिगांसत्, where though गम् means 'to go' and is not, therefore, the substitute of इङ्, the lengthening takes place by the rule [[6.3.137]]. Or the word अच् should not be added in the <i>sutra</i> at all: which should be read as हनगमां सनि meaning "There is lengthening of the stem when the Desiderative सन् follows". This would apply of course, to vowel-ending stems, because the sentence would mean that, for there cannot be lengthening of a consonant. This will apply to गम् also, in this way :-" A stem ending in a vowel is lengthened in the Desiderative, and so also of गम् which is a substitute of the vowel-stem इ" ॥ In this way, we may see, that there is no necessity of the <i>Vartika</i>.
