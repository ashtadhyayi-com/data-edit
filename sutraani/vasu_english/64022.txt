The change which is a अङ्ग (stem) will undergo by the application of any of the rules from this sūtra up to भस्य [[6.4.129]], is to be considered as not to have taken effect when we have to apply any other rule of this very section [[6.4.23]] to [[6.4.129]].
This is an <i>adhikara</i> rule. The above translation is given according to Prof. Bohtlingk. According to <i>Kasika</i> the असिद्धवत् extends up to the end of the chapter. Dr. Ballantyne translates it thus :-"The rules, reckoning from this one to the end of the chapter, are called <i>Abhiya</i>, because the chapter ends with a series of rules dependant on the aphorism '<i>bhasya</i>' [[6.4.129]]. When that (i. e. one of the <i>abhiya</i> rules) is to be brought into operation, having the same place for coming into operation as another <i>abhiya</i>, which has already taken effect, that one which has taken effect, shall be regarded as not having taken effect".

The word आभात् means 'up to भ' i. e. upto [[6.4.129]]. in which last <i>sutra</i> the word भ occurs : i. e. in applying the rules taught upto [[6.4.129]]. The word अत्र shows that the two rules must have the same आश्रय or place of operation, where their places of operation are different, they are not <i>asiddha</i> to each other. The word असिद्ध shows that an <i>utsarga</i> or general rule must take effect, as if existing in spite of a special rule, and that an '<i>adesa</i>' or substitution taught by another rule should not be considered to have taken effect in applying the special rule. Thus in forming एधि and शाधि (Imperative 2nd person) ए is first substituted for अस् 'to be' by [[6.4.119]]: and for शास् by [[6.4.35]] and then is धि added by [[6.4.101]]. The latter rule says that धि is added in the Imperative, only after those roots which end in a consonant of झल् class. Now अस् and शास् end in a <i>jhal</i> consonant, and can take धि, but their substitute ए and शा end in a vowel and not a consonant and should not take धि ॥ The present rule helps us here, and for the application of धि (V1.4.101) the substitution of ए for अस् or शा for शास् should be considered as <i>asiddha</i> or not to have taken effect. Similarly in आगाहि (Vedic Imperative, शप् being elided by [[2.4.73]] and जहि from गम् and हन्, the nasal being elided in the case of गम्, [[6.4.36]] and ज being substituted for हन् [[6.2.36]] we have the stems आग and ज, which ending in अ would require the elision of हि by [[6.4.105]]. But since the change of ज &c is not regarded as having been accomplished, the elision of हि does not take place.

Why do we say आभात् 'up to [[6.4.12]]'? In applying any other rule the changes ordained by <i>abhiya</i> rules would not be considered as <i>asiddha</i>. Thus अभाजि and रागः from भञ्ज् and रञ्ज् ॥ Here the nasals of <i>ranj</i> and <i>bhanj</i> have been elided by [[6.4.27]] — [[6.4.28]] and [[6.4.33]] before the affixes घञ् and चिण् respectively, and we have the stems रज्, and भज् to which rule [[7.2.116]] applies and we have <i>Vriddhi</i> of अ preceding the final consonant. Had the elision of the nasal been considered as non-effective for the purposes of [[7.2.116]], then अ could not have taken <i>Vriddhi</i>, as it would not then be उपधा or penultimate.

Why do we use the word अत्र in the aphorism? The rules are <i>asiddha</i> to each other with regard to a common place of operation and not otherwise. Thus पा + वस् (क्वसु) + अस् (शस् Accusative Plural ). =  पपा + उस् + अस् ([[6.4.131]] vocalisation of व). If this उ substitute be considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.64]], then we cannot elide the आ of पा, because आ is not then followed by a vowel (उ being non-existent). उ however is not considered as <i>asiddha</i>, and आ being thus elided, we have पपुषः in पपुषः पश्य ॥ Similarly चि+ वस् + अस् = चिचि + उस् + अस् ॥  Here also उ is not considered <i>asiddha</i>, and we apply rule [[6.4.82]], and substitute य for उ as चिच्युषः पश्य ॥ Similarly लू + वस् + अस् = लुलू + उस् + अस् = लुलुवुषः ॥ Here also  उ is not considered <i>asiddha</i>, and we change the ऊ of लू into उव् by [[6.4.77]]. In all the above three cases, the elision of आ, or change of इ to य, or of ऊ to उव्, takes place in reference to वस्, while the <i>samprasarana</i> of व takes place with reference to the Accusative plural case-ending अस् which makes the stem <i>Bha</i>. So they have not the same आश्रय ॥ Nor does the maxim of असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे apply here, because the special maxim of <i>Abhiya</i> governs the <i>sutras</i> of this section, so there cannot be the relation of <i>Antaranga</i> and <i>Bahiranga</i> among these <i>sutras</i>, simultaneously with their being <i>asiddha</i> to each other.

Vart:- The substitute वुक् [[6.4.88]], and युट् [[6.4.63]] should however be considered as not <i>asiddha</i>, and rule [[6.4.77]] teaching उवङ् and [[6.4.82]], teaching य् substitution should not be applied simultaneously with them. Thus भू-बभूव, बभूवतुः बभूवः with वुक्, and उपदिदीये, उपदिदीयाते, उपदिदीयिरे with युट् of [[6.4.63]]. In the case of भू, when वुक् is added, there is not the addition of उवङ्, and in the case of दीङ्, when युट् is added, there is not यणादेश ॥

The आ in आभात् has the force of limit inclusive, so that, the <i>asiddha</i> rule applies to the <i>sutras</i> governed by भ ॥
