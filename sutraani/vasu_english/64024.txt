In a root-अङ्ग (stem) ending in a consonant preceded by न् - this न not being added to the root owing to its having an indicatory इ -- इदितो नुम् धातोः [[7.1.58]], the न् is elided when an affix having an indicatory क् or ङ् follows.
Thus from स्रन्स् and ध्वन्स् are formed स्रस्तः and ध्वस्तः with क्त, स्रस्यते, ध्वस्यते with यक्, सनीस्रस्यते, दनीध्वस्यते with यङ् the नी being added by [[7.4.84]]. But नन्द्यते and नानन्द्यते, then न् is not elided, the root being written in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as टुणदि समृद्धौ, and न being added by [[7.1.58]]. Why do we say ending in a consonant? Observe नीयते, नेनीयते from नी which has a penultimate nasal, but ends in a vowel. Why do we say 'penultimate'? Observe नह्यते, नानह्यते ॥ Why do we say having an indicatory क or ङ? Observe स्रंसनं, ध्वंसनं with ल्युट् ॥

Vart:- The roots लङ्ग (लगि) and कम्प् (कपि) are exceptions, where meaning 'to feel pain or difficulty' and 'a disease of the body'. These, though exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with an indicatory इ, are treated as exceptions to the rule of अनिदित् : thus विलगितः and विकपितः, when not having the above meanings, we have विलङ्कितं and विकम्पितं ॥

Vart:- The causative of the root रञ्ज, loses its nasal when meaning 'to hunt deer' : as, रजयति मृगान् 'he hunts the deer', but रञ्जयति वस्त्राणि 'he colors the clothes'.

Vart:- रञ्ज loses its nasal before the affix घिनुण्, as रागी ॥

Vart:- The words रजकः, रजनम्, and रजः are formed from रञ्ज by the elision of the nasal.
