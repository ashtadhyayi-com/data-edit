स्कन्दि and स्यन्द retain their nasal before the affix क्त।
Thus स्कन्त्वा, and स्यन्दित्वा or स्यन्त्वा, the इट् being added when स्यन्द is considered as having an indicatory ऊ in the <i>dhatupatha</i>. When इट् is added, क्त्वा is no longer कित् by virtue of the rule [[1.2.18]], and elision would not take place, for no rule of elision would apply in that case.
