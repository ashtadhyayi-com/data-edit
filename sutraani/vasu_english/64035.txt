Before the Imperative affix हि , शा is substituted for शास्।
Thus अनुशाधि, प्रशाधि ॥ The हि is changed to धि by [[6.4.101]]. See [[6.4.22]]. The <i>anuvritti</i> of उपधायाः is not here, so शा is substituted in the room of the full word शास् and not only for the penultimate vowel of  शास् ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of कित् and ङित् also is not here. Therefore, when this हि is treated as पित् [[3.4.88]], then too the substitution takes place, though a पित् <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> is not ङित् [[1.2.4]]. Thus शाधि is also found in the Vedas as having acute on the first syllable, which can only be when धि is पित् and consequently <i>anudatta</i> [[3.1.4]]
