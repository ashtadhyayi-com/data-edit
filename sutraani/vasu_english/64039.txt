Before the affix क्तिच् the above roots (वन and तनादि) neither drop their nasal nor lengthen their root-vowel.
The above roots i. e. <i>anudattopadesa</i>, ending in a nasal, and वन and तनादि, do not lose their nasal before क्तिच्. Thus यन्ति꣡, तन्ति꣡, वन्ति꣡ ॥ The lengthening would have taken place by [[6.4.15]], when the nasal was not elided : that also is prohibited.
