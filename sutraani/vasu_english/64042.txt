The long आ is substituted for the final of जन् , सन् and खन् before the consonant beginning Desiderative affix सन् and before any other affix beginning with a झल् consonant which has an indicatory क् or ङ्।
Thus जातः, जातवान्, जातिः, सातः, सातवान्, सातिः, सिषासति; खातः, खातवान्, खातिः ॥ In जन् and खन् the Desiderative does not begin with a consonant, but takes the augment इट्, the न् is not therefore elided, as जिजनिषति, चिखनिषति ॥ In the case of the root सन्, the Desiderative takes इ, so we have two forms सिषासति and सिसनिषति [[7.2.49]]. The Desiderative has, therefore, been mentioned in the aphorism, only for the sake of the root सन् ॥

If the phrase सन्झलोः be taken to mean 'the Desiderative beginning with a consonant', then we should read the <i>anuvritti</i> of झालि क्ङिति from the preceding <i>sutras</i>, to complete the sense of this; and if the phrase means "when the Desiderative of a <i>jhaladi</i> affix follows", then we should qualify the word Desiderative by the word <i>jhal</i> from the preceding <i>sutras</i>. Or we may divide the <i>sutra</i> into two (1) Before a कित् or ङित् <i>jhaladi</i> affix long आ is the substitute of the न् of '<i>jan</i>', '<i>san</i>' and '<i>khan</i>'. (2) And so is the case, when the Desiderative affix follows, not having the augment इ, for then also the न् of '<i>jan</i>', '<i>san</i>' and '<i>khan</i>' is replaced by long आ ॥

The न् of the root सन् would have required elision by [[6.4.37]], because this verb belongs to <i>Tanadi</i> class, still the आ substitution taught in this <i>sutra</i> takes place, by preference, on the maxim of विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम् [[1.4.2]]. In fact, though in this section of <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]] one rule is considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the operations of another rule, yet one rule supersedes another by the maxim of <i>vipratisedha</i>. That that maxim applies in this section also, is to be inferred from the employment of the term हल् in [[6.4.66]], which supersedes the <i>lopa</i> of आ taught in [[6.4.64]], and substitutes instead the long ई ॥
