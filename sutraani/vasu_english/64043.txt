There is optionally the substitution of long आ for the finals of जन् , सन् and खन् before the affix beginning with य and marked with an indicatory क् or ङ्।
Thus जायते or जन्यते (with यक्) जाजायते or जज्जन्यते (with यङ्) । So also सायते or सन्यते, सासायते, or संसन्यते, खायते, or खन्यते, चाखायते or चङ्खन्यते ॥ Before the <i>vikarana</i> श्यन् of the Fourth class, which is ङित् according to (l. 2.4); the जा is always substituted for जन् by [[7.3.79]]. No option is allowed there.
