The long आ is optionally substituted for the final of सन् before the affix क्तिच् and there is also optional elision of the nasal.
Thus we have three forms सातिः꣡, सन्तिः꣡ and सतिः꣡ ॥ The word अन्यतरस्याम् 'optionally' has been employed in the <i>sutra</i> for the sake of clearness only; for the विभाषा of [[6.4.43]] could have been read into it by <i>anuvritti</i>. Lest any one should doubt, that the <i>anuvritti</i> of विभाषा had ceased with the last aphorism, this word अन्यतरस्याम् is employed here.
