In the room of र् and the penultimate letter स् of the root भ्रस्ज , there is optionally the substitute रम् when an आर्धधातुक affix follows.
The र् and स् cease to exist and र takes their place. The substitute having an indicatory म् comes after the final vowel [[1.1.49]]. Thus भ्रस्ज + तृ = भर्ज् + तृ = भर्ष्टा the ज being changed to ष by [[8.2.36]], and त to ट by [[8.4.41]]. The other form will be भ्रष्टा; so also भर्ष्टुम् and भर्ष्टुम्, भ्रष्टव्यम् and भर्ष्टव्यम्, भ्रज्जनम् or भर्ज्जनम् ॥ But भृष्टः and भृष्टवान् by [[6.1.16]], in spite of this rule. The word उपदेश [[6.4.37]]. is understood here also. The rule therefore applies to the simple root <i>bhrasj</i> as originally taught in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, and not to any Derivative root from it. As the Intensive (यङ) is बरीभृज्यते ॥
