When a consonant precedes the final य in a verbal अङ्ग (stem) this य is also elided before an आर्धधातुक affix.
Thus बेभिदिता, बेभिदितुम्, बेभिदितव्यम् from the Intensive stern बेभिद्य ॥ In the <i>sutra</i> यस्य is given, which is the Genitive singular of य namely of the letters य् अ ॥ By the rule of अलोऽन्त्यस्य [[1.1.52]], the अ of य ought to be elided and not य्; but that rule is evidently inapplicable here, since the elision of अ would have taken place by the preceding rule : the present rule therefore teaches the elision of य (<i>ya</i>). Or the word हलः may be considered as in the ablative case, and then by [[1.1.54]], the first letter would be elided namely य ॥ Why have we taken [the two letters (संघात) conjointly viz.] य and not य्? Observe ईर्ष्यिता, मव्यिता, शुच्यिता from the simple roots ईर्ष्य्, मव्य्, and शुच्य् ॥ Here य् not being followed by अ, is not elided (see <i>Bhvadi</i> 541-546). Why do we say "when preceded by a consonant?" Observe लोलूयिता, पोपूयिता ॥
