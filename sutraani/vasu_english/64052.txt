The affix णि is elided before the affixes क्त and क्तवतु when these take the augment इट् ।
Thus कारितम्, हारितम्, गणितम्, लक्षितम् ॥ Why do we say "before an <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix having the augment इट्"? Observe संज्ञपितः पशुः ॥ This is the part participle of the causative, the इ being the sign of the causative. By [[7.2.15]] read with [[7.2.49]], ज्ञप् is a root which takes no इट् augment in the <i>Nishtha</i>. It may be objected that [[7.2.15]] preventing इट् augment applies to verbs of one syllable [[7.2.10]], and the causative ज्ञपि being of two syllables will always have इट् in the <i>Nishtha</i>, and so it is useless to use the word सेटि in the <i>sutra</i>. The word सेटि in the <i>sutra</i> fixes the time when the elision of णि should take place. Namely, first there should be added the augment इट् and then, there should take place the elision of णि ॥ Otherwise we shall have this difficulty कारि + त, here let us elide the णि first : and we get कार् + त, now we cannot add इट् to त, for कार् being a verb of one syllable will not take इट् by [[7.2.10]]. Therefore, the reverse process must be adopted. We must elide इट् first. For ज्ञपितः see also [[7.2.27]].
