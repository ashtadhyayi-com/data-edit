शमिता is formed irregularly by the elision of णि before an इट् augmented affix when meaning a sacrificial act.
Thus शृतं हविः शमितः ॥ It is formed by तृच् and is in the Vocative case. Why do we say 'when referring to a sacrificial act'? See शृतं हविः शमयितः ॥ See <i>Satpatha</i> <i>Brahmana</i> III.8.3, 4 and 5.
