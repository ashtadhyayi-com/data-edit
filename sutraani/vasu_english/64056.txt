अय् is substituted for the इ of णि before the Absolutive affix ल्यप् when the vowel preceding the इ is light.
Thus प्रशमय्य गतः, संदमय्य गतः, प्रवेभिदय्य, प्रगणय्य ॥ But प्रपात्य गतः the vowel preceding the इ being long. Here [[6.4.51]] applies. The shortening, the elision of य and the elision of अ should not be considered as <i>asiddha</i>, as their place of operation is not the same. Thus शम् + णिच् = शामि; this आ is shortened by [[6.4.92]], and we have शमि ॥ This shortening is not to be considered as <i>asiddha</i>, for if <i>asiddha</i>, there being no <i>laghu</i> <i>purva</i>, the present rule would not apply. Similarly वेभिद्य is the Intensive root, its य is elided by [[6.4.49]], this elision is not considered as <i>asiddha</i>, if it were <i>asiddha</i>, the इ of भि would not be <i>laghu</i>. Similarly the elision of अ in गण which is a root which ends in अ, (see <i>Dhatupatha</i> <i>Churadi</i> 309), is not considered as <i>asiddha</i> for similar reasons.
