The final आ of a root is elided before an आर्धधातुक affix with the augment इट् as well as when it begins with a vowel and has an indicatory क् or ङ्।
Thus पपिथ and तस्थिथ ॥ Here the affix has the इट् augment. पपतुः, पपुः, तस्थतुः, तस्थुः ॥ Here the affixes are कित् by [[1.2.5]] गोदः, कम्बलदः with the affix क [[3.2.3]]. So also प्रदा (fem), प्रधा (fem) by अङ् [[3.3.106]]. Before <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affixes, we have यान्ति, वान्ति, व्यत्यरे and व्यत्यले ॥ The two letter are the Imperfect Ist Person Singular <i>Atmanepada</i> of रा and ला with the affix इ (इट्). When it does not begin with a vowel, we have ग्लायते, दासीय ॥
