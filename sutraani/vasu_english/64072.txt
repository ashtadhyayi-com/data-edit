आट् acutely accented (उदात्त) is the augment of a verbal अङ्ग (stem) beginning with a vowel in the Aorist, Imperfect and the Conditional.
Thus ऐक्षिष्ट, ऐक्षत, ऐक्षिष्यत; औव्जीत्, औव्जत्, औव्जिष्यत् ॥ ऐहिष्ट, ऐहत and ऐहष्य औम्भीत्, औम्भत्, and औम्भिष्यत् ॥ The <i>Vriddhi</i> takes place by [[6.1.90]].

The Passive Imperfect (लङ्) of यज्, वप् and वह are ऐज्यत, औप्यत and औह्यत formed by आट् and not अट् ॥ First, the affixes of the Imperfect are added and then the Passive characteristic यक् is added to these roots, which causes the vocalisation of the semi-vovels, and we have इज्यत, उप्यत, and उह्यत stems [[6.1.15]]. The stems having now assumed a form in which they begin with a vowel, take आट् ॥ The addition of tense-affixes being an <i>antaranga</i> operation precedes the addition of augment. After the affixes have been added, the <i>vikarana</i> यक, being <i>nitya</i>, is added and precedes in order the augment, the latter being so far <i>anitya</i>; after यक् addition the roots assume a form in which we can add आट् ॥ Why आट् is considered <i>anitya</i> depends on the following maxim :- शब्दान्तरस्य प्राप्नुवन् विधिरनित्यो भवति "when the word-form in reference to which a rule teaches something; after the taking effect of another rule that applies simultaneously would be different from what it was before that other rule had taken effect, then the former rule is not <i>nitya</i>."
