There is diversity in the छन्दस् (Vedas) : the augment अट् or आट् is added even with मा and sometimes not added even there is no मा।
Thus in जनिष्ठा उग्रः (<i>Rig</i> X. 73.1), काममूनयीत् (<i>Rig</i> I.53.3) and काममर्दयीत्; the augment is not added though there is no मा ॥ In मा वः क्षेत्रे परबीजान्यवाप्सुः, मा अभित्थाः, मा आवः, the augment is not elided, though the particle मा is added.
