When a case-affix beginning with a vowel follows, then the semi-vowel व् is substituted for the final ऊ of a अङ्ग (stem) containing more than one syllable if the अङ्ग (stem) ends with a verbal root ending in ऊ not preceded by a conjunct consonant forming part of the root.
As no roots at the end of a stem end in short उ, the latter is not mentioned in the translation. Thus खलपू 'a sweeper':- dual खलप्वौ, plural खलप्वः; so also शतस्वौ and शतस्वः, and सकृल्लू : dual सकृल्ल्वौ and सकृल्ल्वः ॥ But लुलुवतुः and लुलुवः before tense-affixes, (non-सुप्); लू - लुवौ, लुवः (because consisting of one syllable only), and कटप्रू - कटप्रुवौ, कटप्रुवः (because ऊ is preceded by a conjunct consonant forming part of the root). The rule does not apply if the first member is not a <i>Gati</i> or a <i>Karaka</i> word: as परमलूः- परमलुवौ and परमलुवः ॥
