For the penultimate ओ of the गुण-ated अङ्ग (stem) गोह् (from गुह्) there is the substituted ऊ before an affix beginning with a vowel.
Thus निगूहति, निगूहकः, साधुनिगूहिन्, निगूहम्, निगूहन्ति, गूहो वर्तते ॥ Why do we say 'penultimate'? So that the substitution should not apply any where else. The form गोह् is taken in the <i>sutra</i> to prohibit the application of the rule to cases where गुह् does not assume the form गोह् ॥ Therefore not here, निजुगुहतुः, निजुगुहुः ॥ This change will not take place before the affixes beginning with a consonant; as निगोढा, निगोढुम् ॥ Some say, the word is exhibited as गोह in order to prohibit the अय् substitution of णि before ल्यप् ॥ As निगाहि + ल्यप् = निगूह्य ([[6.4.56]] not applied), the ऊ substitution being considered as <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]] would have brought in अय्, गूह् being considered as a word having a light vowel for its penultimate. According to <i>Kasika</i> the ऊ substitution, however, is not <i>asiddha</i>, as their places of operation are different.
