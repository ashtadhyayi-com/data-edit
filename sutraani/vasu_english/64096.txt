The penultimate of चुरादि (10th Conjugation) - छद् is shortened before the affix घ -- पुंसि संज्ञायां घः प्रायेण [[3.3.118]], when not preceded by two prepositions (or more).
As उरश्छदः, प्रच्छदः, दन्तच्छदः ॥ But समुपच्छादः with two prepositions. The same when preceded by more than two prepositions, as समुपातिच्छादः ॥ The elision of णि of छादि &c., by [[6.4.51]], should not be considered as <i>asiddha</i> [[6.4.22]] or <i>sthanivat</i> [[1.1.57]], otherwise there would be no penultimate to be shortened.

Vart:- The prohibition with regard to द्वि should be extended to numbers more than two.
