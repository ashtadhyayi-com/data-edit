धि is substituted for the Imperative affix हि when the tense-affix is not ङित्।
Under [[3.4.88]] हि is also पित् in the Vedas : and when it is पित्, it is not ङित् by [[1.2.4]]. Thus रारन्धि, यन्धि and युयोधि in the following सोमरारन्धि अस्मभ्यं तद्धर्यश्व प्रयन्धि, युयोध्यस्मज् जुहुराणमेनः 

Why do we say 'when it is not ङित्'? Observe प्रीणीहि ॥ रारन्धि is irregularly <i>Parasmaipada</i> of रम्; the शप् being replaced by श्लु, and the reduplicate lengthened as a Vedic form. The म्, is not elided, by [[6.4.37]] as the affix is not ङित् ॥ प्रयन्धि is from यम, the शप् is elided : and युयोधि from यु (यौति), the शप् being replaced by श्लु ॥
