The Imperative affix हि is elided after the उ of an affix in the विकरण with which the Present-अङ्ग (stem) (special conjugation) is made, provided that the उ is not preceded by a conjunct consonant.
The affix उ with which the Present-stem is made is उ and श्नु ॥ Thus चिनु, सुनु, कुरु ॥ Why after 'उ'? Observe लुनीहि, सुनीहि ॥ Why do we say "उ being part of the <i>vikarana</i> or affix"? Observe रुहि, युहि, here उ is part of the root itself, and not of the <i>vikarana</i>. Why de we say 'not preceded by a conjunct consonant'? Observe प्राप्नुहि, राध्नुहि, तक्ष्णुहि ॥

Vart:- The elision of हि after the उ of the <i>vikarana</i> उ and श्नु is optional in the Vedas; as आतनुहि यातुधानान्, धिनुहि यज्ञपतिम्, तेन मा भागिनं कृणुहि ॥
