The पु of the विकरण उ and श्नु when not preceded by a conjunct consonant, may be elided optionally before a personal affix beginning with म् or व्।
Thus सुन्वः or सुनुवः, सुन्मः, सुनुमः, तन्वः, तनुवः, तन्मः, तनुमः ॥ The उ must belong to the affix, and should not be part of the root. Therefore not in युवः, युमः ॥

Why do we say 'not preceded by a conjunct consonant'? Observe शक्नुवः, शक्नुमः only. Though the elision word लुक् was understood in this <i>sutra</i>, the mention of लोप indicates that the final is only to be elided, and not the whole affix नु ॥ It is a general maxim that the words लुक्, श्लु and लुप् cause the elision of the whole affix, while '<i>lopa</i>' will cause elision of the final letter only of the affix. If the whole affix be elided, we could not get सुन्वः &c., Moreover, in कुर्व and कुर्म formed by <i>guna</i> of कृ, there would have been no <i>guna</i>, had the word लुक् been used, for [[1.1.63]], would have prevented <i>guna</i>; but by using the word लोप we have such <i>guna</i> also by [[1.1.62]].
