ए is substituted for अ of a verbal अङ्ग (stem) standing between two simple consonants, the अङ्ग (stem) not having any different letter substituted in the reduplicate when the ending थल् of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) having the augment इट् follows and thereby the reduplicate is elided.
Thus पेचिथ, शेकिथ ॥ But पपक्थ before <i>anit</i> थ; दिदेविथ, the vowel being इ and not अ; ततक्षिथ, ररक्षिथ, the अ not standing between two simple consonants; and चकणिथ, बभणिथ, the reduplicate having the substitutes च and ब different from क and  भ ॥ This <i>sutra</i> applies even when the affix is not कित्; and थल् is read in the <i>sutra</i> only for the sake of clearness, no non-<i>kit</i> Perfect ending can take इट् except थल् ॥
