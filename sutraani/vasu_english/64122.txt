ए is substituted for अ of 1. तॄ 2. फल 3. भज and 4. त्रप and the reduplicate is elided when the affixes of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) having an indicatory क् (or ङ्) follow, as well as when थल् of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) having the augment इट् follows.
Thus तेरतुः, तेरुः, तेरिथ, फेलतुः, फेलुः, फेलिथ, भेजतु, भेजुः, भेजिथ, त्रेपे, त्रेपते, त्रेपिरे ॥ In the case of तॄ the rule applies to the अ obtained by <i>Guna</i>, contrary to [[6.4.126]], in फल् and भज् the rule, that no different substitute should be in the reduplicate, is not adhered to, and in त्रप the अ does not stand between two simple consonants.

Vart:- It should be stated that the rule applies to श्रन्थ also:- as, श्रेथतुः, श्रेथुः ॥
