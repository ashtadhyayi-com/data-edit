ए is substituted for आ of राध when meaning 'to hurt someone' and the reduplicate is elided before the affixes क् (or ङ्) or as well as before थल् of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) having the augment इट्।
Thus अपरेधतुः, अपरेधुः, अपरेधिथ, but रराधतुः, रराधुः, रराधिथ in any other sense than that of 'hurting'. In this <i>sutra</i> the long आ of राध is to be replaced by ए, the <i>anuvritti</i> of short अ (अतः [[6.4.120]]) is therefore not appropriate here. We should either read the <i>anuvritti</i> of आ from [[6.4.112]], or we should read the word एकहलमध्ये in this way "in राध् whatever stands between two simple consonants is replaced by ए".
