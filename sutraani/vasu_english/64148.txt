The final अ and इ (both long and short) of a भ अङ्ग (stem) are elided before a तद्धित affix.
Thus दाक्षी, प्लाक्षी, सखी from दाक्षि, प्लाक्षि and सखि with the feminine affix ई [[4.1.65]] The above forms could also have been evolved by the simple rules of <i>sandhi</i>, as दाक्षि + ई = दाक्षी ॥ It might be asked, where was then the necessity of eliding इ? There would arise difficulty in the forms like अति सखि ॥  From the word सखी formed by ङीष् under [[4.1.62]], we form the compound सखीमतिक्रान्तः = अतिसखि, the final becoming short by [[1.2.48]] (the <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् is not added here as required by [[5.4.91]], that rule applying to the masculine form सखि and not to the feminine सखी). Now if in forming सखि + ई = सखी, had we not elided the letter इ of खि, then the long  ई being the single substitute for both इ + ई, would be considered as like the final इ of सखि by [[6.1.85]]. That being so, the word अतिसखि would be considered a non-घि word by (I .4.7), for सखि has been specifically excluded form घि class. Not being a घि, we cannot have the form अतिसखेः in the Ablative and Genitive singular. Hence the necessity of eliding इ before the feminine ई, so that the <i>ekadesa</i> rule [[6.1.85]], should not apply.

The short इ is elided before <i>Taddhita</i> affixes:- दुलि — दौलेयः, वलि — वालेयः, अत्रि — आत्रेयः ॥ अ is elided before ई as :- कुमार — कुमारी, गौर — गौरी, शार्ङ्गरव — शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ अ and आ are elided before the <i>Taddhita</i> :- दक्ष - दाक्षि, प्लक्ष — प्लाक्षिः, चूड — चौडिः, बलाका — बालाकिः, सुमित्रा — सौमित्रिः ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of ई (शी), when it is the substitute of औ [[7.1.18]], being the case-affix of the nominative, and accusative dual in the neuter, and of certain feminine in long आ ॥ Before this ई, the preceding vowel, इ and अ are not elided. The stem before this ई is also <i>bha</i> by (I .4.18) in the case of Neuter nouns. Thus काण्ड + ई = काण्डे; कुड्ये ॥ सौर्य + ई = सौर्ये (the य would have been elided by [[6.4.149]]. It is owing to this <i>Vartika</i>, that we have inserted the word 'feminine' in the translation of the <i>sutra</i>. This may also be done by reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of श्यां [[6.4.136]], and न [[6.4.137]] into this <i>sutra</i>.

Vart:- इयङ् and उवङ् are superseded, when they would apply simultaneously with this <i>lopa</i>. Thus इयङ् and उवङ् have unimpeded scope in श्री or भ्रू + औ or अस् (जस्), as श्रियौ, श्रियः, भ्रुवौ, भ्रुवः ॥ <i>Lopa</i> has unimpeded scope in कमण्डलू — कामण्डलेयः (with ढञ् [[4.1.135]]), and भाद्रवाहेयः ॥ But in वत्सप्री + ढञ् [[4.1.135]], both the rules [[6.4.77]] and [[6.4.148]], present themselves. The former is superseded, and we have वात्सप्रेयः (वत्सं प्रीणाति = वत्सप्रीः, तस्यापत्यं); so also लैखाभ्रेयः with the ढक् affix, this word belonging to <i>Subhradi</i> class [[4.1.123]].
