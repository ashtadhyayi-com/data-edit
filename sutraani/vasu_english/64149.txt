Of the भ अङ्ग (stems) 1. सूर्य 2. तिष्य 3. अगस्त्य and 4. मत्स्य (and their derivatives when they are भ) the penultimate य् is also is also elided before a तद्धित affix.
Thus सूर्येणैकादिक् = सौरी (सूर्य + अण् under [[4.3.112]] = सौर्य, then ई of ङीप् = सौरी), as सौरी बलाका ॥

So also तिष्य — तैषमहः, तैषी रात्रिः ॥ So also अगस्त्यस्यापत्यं स्त्री = आगस्ती [[4.1.114]], आगस्तीयः; So also मत्स्य — मत्सी with ङीष् as it belongs to <i>Gauradi</i> class [[4.1.40]]. If the words सूर्य &c, were to be qualified by the word भ, then the <i>sutra</i> would mean सूर्यादीनां भसंज्ञानां "of सूर्य &c, when they get the designation of भ"; and the result of this interpretation would be, that the rule would apply to cases like सूर्यस्य स्त्री = सूरी, आगस्त्यस्य स्त्री = आगस्ती &c, only, where the forms सूर्य &c, are <i>Bha</i>, and not to their derivatives, as सौर्य &c: and there would not have been the forms like सौरी बलाका; because, here the word सूर्य is not <i>Bha</i> before the affix ई, but the word सौर्य is <i>Bha</i>. Hence we have introduced the words "and their derivatives" in the translation, so as to cover the cases like सौरी बलाका ॥

In the last example, we again have an illustration, of the rule [[6.4.22]], which says that for purposes of <i>asiddha</i> the आश्रय must be the same. Thus सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + अ <i>lopa</i> + ई = सौरी ॥ But सौर्य itself was formed by the elision of अ of सूर्य before the affix अण्, thus, सूर्य + अण् = सौर्य् + ० + सौर्य् (last <i>sutra</i>) = सौर्य ॥ But if this <i>lopa</i> be considered as <i>asiddha</i> by [[6.4.22]], then we have the following equation सौर्य् + ० + अ (of अण्) + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ० (अ of अण् being elided by [[6.4.148]] + ई ॥ Here य् cannot be elided, as it is not <i>upadha</i> or penultimate: because the first <i>lopa</i> is considered <i>asiddha</i>. But it is not to be so considered, as their scopes (आश्रय) are different. Hence we have the elision of य् by this <i>sutra</i>. It should not be objected that the य् here is not penultimate, but ultimate: as सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ई (अ elided by the last <i>sutra</i>), and thus य् is ultimate. Here, however, rule [[6.4.22]], applies. This elision of अ will be considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the elision of य्, their scope being the same. So being considered <i>asiddha</i>, य् still retains its designation of <i>upadha</i> and is elided by the present <i>sutra</i>. It should be remembered here, that we could not take help of the rule of <i>sthanivat</i>-<i>bhava</i>, because for purposes of यलोप, that rule is set aside. See [[1.1.58]].

Why do we say the penultimate य्? Observe मत्स्यचरी ॥ This word is thus formed. The affix चरट् is added to मत्सी by [[5.3.53]], in the sense of मत्सी भूतपूर्वा ॥ Then the मत्सी becomes masculine मत्स्य by [[6.4.35]], and we have मत्स्यचर ॥ This word takes ङीप् by [[4.1.15]], because it is formed by an affix having an indicatory ट् ॥ Thus मत्स्यचर + ई, and the word is भ, but the य is not elided, because it is not penultimate. The य has been read for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> : उपधायाः alone would have been enough for the purposes of this aphorism. The rule contained in this <i>sutra</i> is rather too general; it is limited by the following <i>vartikas</i>, which enumerate the conditions under which the elision takes place.

Vart:- The य of मत्स्य is elided before the feminine ई only: therefore not here मत्स्यस्येदं मांसं = मात्स्यम् ॥  

Vart:-  Of सूर्य and अगस्त्य before the affixes छ, and ई (of the feminine): as सौरीयः, सौरी, आगस्तीयः, आगस्ती ॥ But not here सौर्यं चरुं निर्वपेत्, आगस्त्य formed with the Patronymic अण् [[4.1.114]]

Vart:- Of तिष्य and पुष्य when referring to asterisms, as, तिष्येण नक्षत्रेण युक्तः कालः = तैषः, पौषः [[4.2.3]].

Vart:- Of अन्तिक before the affix तसि, the क is elided, and the word has acute on the first syllable : as, अन्तितः in अन्तितो न दूरात्[[5.4.45]].

Vart:- Before the affix तम, it loses the syllable तिक as well as क, as अन्तमः or अन्तितमः, in अग्रे त्वं नो अन्तिमः अन्तितमे अवरोहति ॥

Vart:- The elision of क of अन्तिक takes place diversely, before the second member also, as अन्तिके सीदति = अन्तिषत् (स changed to ष by [[8.3.106]])

Vart:- The elision takes place also before the affix य, as अन्तियः, this is found in the <i>Atharva</i>-<i>Veda</i>, (अन्तिके भवः, with the affix यत् [[4.4.110]]).
