The affix तृ is elided before the affixes 1. इष्ठन् 2. इमनिव् and 3. ईयसुन्।
Thus करिष्ठः, विजयिष्ठः, वहिष्ठः, दोहीयसी धेनुः ॥ The whole affix तृ is elided; otherwise only the last vowel (टि) with the following consonant would have been elided by the following rules. The <i>anuvritti</i> of लुक् of the last aphorism should not be read into this, for had the elision taken place by लुक्, then the mark of the affix would also have disappeared likewise [[1.1.63]], and there would have remained no <i>guna</i> in विजयिष्ठ and करिष्ठ ॥ See [[5.1.122]], and [[5.3.59]]; for these affixes. The affix इमन् has been read into this aphorism for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, there being no example of तृ followed by इमन्; तृ is followed by इष्ठ and ईयस् by [[5.3.59]].
