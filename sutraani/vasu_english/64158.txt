The इ and ई of these affixes (इमन् and ईयस्) are elided after बहु , and for बहु is substituted भू।
Thus भूयान्, भूमा ॥ In the case of इष्ठ, the following rule 159 will apply. Under [[1.1.54]] and [[1.1.67]], बहोः being in the Ablative, the first letter of the succeeding term is elided, viz. इ or ई; in this case. बहु belongs to <i>Prithvadi</i> class and takes इमन् affix. [[5.1.122]] The repetition of बहोः is for the sake of pointing out the <i>sthani</i>, for which the word भू is to be substituted : otherwise  भू would have replaced these affixes.
