After बहु , the augment यिट् is added to इष्ठ and भू is the substitute of बहु।
As भूयिष्ठः ॥ This augment यिट् debars the <i>lopa</i> substitution, of the last <i>sutra</i>, in the case of इष्ठ ॥ The इ in यिट् is for the sake of pronunciative, the augment being य ॥ Or इष्ठ may be taken to have lost its इ by the foregoing <i>sutra</i>, and to the ष्ठ, the augment यि may be added.
