आ is substituted for the first letter of ईयस् after ज्य।
As ज्यायान् ॥ ज्य is substituted for प्रशस्य by [[5.3.61]]. '<i>Lopa</i>' being shut out by the intervening यिट् [[6.4.159]], the आत् is read in this <i>sutra</i>. If the <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>lopa</i>' were present here, then the अ of ज्य would be lengthened before यस् by [[7.4.25]], and we would get the form ज्यायान् ॥ The peculiar construction of this <i>sutra</i> indicates the existence of the following maxim:- अङ्गवृत्ते पुनर्वृत्तावविधिः "when an operation which is taught in the <i>angadhikara</i> (VI.4, end-VII.4, end) has taken place, and another operation of the <i>angadhikara</i> is subsequently applicable, this latter operation is not allowed to take place." In [[7.4.25]], however, क्ङित् is understood, and lengthening could not have taken place by that rule.
