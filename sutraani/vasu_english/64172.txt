कार्म is irregularly formed from कर्मन् by the elision of the final अन् when the sense is 'accustomed to such occupation or prompt therein'.
This is formed by ण affix [[4.4.62]]. If this is the case, then by [[6.4.144]], the form कार्म is regularly evolved. The fact is, that ण् and अण् affixes, in the sense of <i>tachchhilika</i> are considered as one, and therefore [[6.4.167]], would have prevented the elision of the final अन् syllable. In fact this proves the existence of the folloving maxim :- ताच्छीलिके णेऽण् कृतानि भवन्ति ॥ "The same operations which are occasioned by the addition of the affix अण्, take place, whenever the affix ण is added in the sense of one accustomed to that." Thus though ङीप् is added, to अण् - formed words, it is also added to ण - formed words, in the feminine: as चौरी; तापसी &c. The ण taught in [[5.2.101]], and [[3.1.140]], is excepted. Why do we say, having the sense of accustomed to that? Observe कर्मणः इदम् = कार्मणम् ॥
