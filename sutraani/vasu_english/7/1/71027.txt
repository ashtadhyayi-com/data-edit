Thus तव and मम ॥ The indicatory श् of अश् shows that by [[1.1.55]], the whole of the affix अस् is to be replaced : otherwise it would have replaced only the first letter of the affix; and the affix not being a substitute-affix, rule [[7.2.89]], would not be applicable to it. The तव is substituted for युस्मद्, and मम for अस्मद् by [[7.2.96]]; and तव + अ (अश्), and मम + अ = तव and मम् by (VI. I. 97).
