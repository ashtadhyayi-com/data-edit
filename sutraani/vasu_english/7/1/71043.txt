यजध्वैनम् is irregularly formed in the छन्दस् (Vedas) for यजध्वनमेनम्।
The word यजध्वम् followed by एनम् loses its final म् in the <i>Veda</i>. As यजध्वैनं प्रियमेधाः (<i>Rig</i> VIII. 2. 37). The <i>Kasika</i> adds "that व is also irregularly changed into य" : the form would then be यजध्यैनम् ॥ This is, however, a mistake as pointed out by <i>Bhattoji</i> <i>Dikshit</i>.
