आत् (आ) is substituted for the final of 1. पथिन् 2. मथिन् and 3. ऋभुक्षिन् before the ending  सु (Nominative 1st-Case and Vocative Case singular).
As पन्थाः, मन्थाः, ऋभुक्षाः ॥ Though the <i>sthanin</i> here is a nasal (i.e. म्), yet the substitute आ is not to be nasalised, but to be pronounced purely. For न्थ see (VII. I. 87). The nasal आ is not to be taken on the maxim भाव्यमानेन सवर्णानां ग्रहणं न भवति ॥ "A letter which is taught in a rule does not denote the letters homogeneous with it."
