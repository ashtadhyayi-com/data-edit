वाच्य ऊर्णोर्नुवद्भावो यङ्प्रसिद्धिः प्रयोजनम् ।
आमश्च प्रतिषेधार्थमेकाचश्चेडुपग्रहात् ॥

As श्रित्वा, श्रितः, श्रितवान् ॥ So also with roots ending in उक् vowels : as युत्वा, युतः, युतवान्; लूत्वा, लूनः, लूनवान्; वृत्वा, वृतः, वृतवान्; तीर्त्वा, तीर्णः, तीर्णवान् ॥

Why 'श्रि and उक् ending roots only'? Observe विदितः ॥ Why having an indicatory क्? Observe श्रयितृ, श्रयितुम्, श्रयितव्यम् ॥ Some read two क's in the <i>sutra</i> and would apply it to the indicatory ग् also, as भूष्णु [[3.2.139]].

This rule applies to those roots, which have not been enumerated above. In the case of यु the <i>Nishtha</i> will not take इट् even by [[7.2.49]] read with [[7.2.15]].

When two क are read in the <i>sutra</i>, one standing for ग्; there arises a little difficulty of combination. Thus ग् coming after the <i>visarga</i> of उकः would require that the <i>visarga</i> be changed to उ by [[6.1.114]]. If ग् be changed to क् [[8.4.55]] then also, the <i>visarga</i> required to be changed into <i>upadhmaniya</i> by [[8.3.37]]. If the change of ग् into क् [[8.4.55]] be considered <i>asiddha</i> (VIII. 2. 1.), then also the <i>visarga</i> must be changed to उ [[6.1.114]], and the <i>sutra</i> should be श्र्युकोकिति ॥ This, however, is not done as an anomaly allowable in <i>sutra</i> construction. According to <i>Kasika</i>, this difficulty would not at all arise, if in the <i>sutra</i> ग्लाजिस्थश्चक्स्नु [[3.2.139]], the स्था + आ be taken as compounded into स्था; so that that rule would apply to that स्था which ends in आ, and not to that स्था whose final is changed to ई; so that the form स्थास्नुः is evolved without anomaly: and the affix will be कित् (क्स्नु) and not गित् (ग्स्नु). The affix being कित्, the above <i>sandhi</i> difficulty will not arise at all.

The word उपदेश is understood here also, so that the rule will apply to roots which end in उक् vowel, in their original states and not to the transformed base before the affix. Thus तॄ is a उक्-ending root, which is transformed to तीर् before the <i>Nishtha</i> त ॥ The rule will apply to it, as तीर्णः ॥ If you object saying, that तॄ  ends in long ॠ and its Desiderative optionally takes इट् by [[7.2.41]], and therefore, its <i>Nishtha</i> will always take no इट् by [[7.2.15]]. we reply, that the option taught in [[7.2.41]] applies to roots ending in long ॠ; but when the root vowel is changed to ई, it is no longer a ॠ-ending root. If you say, the rule of <i>sthanivad</i> <i>bhava</i> will apply: we say, that that rule is not applicable to अल् विधि, and this is an अल्विधि ॥ Therefore, the word उपदेश should be read into this <i>sutra</i>. If this be so, the rule ought to apply to जागृ, and we could not get the forms जागरितः and जागरितवान् ॥ To explain this we should also read the <i>anuvritti</i> of एकाच् into this <i>sutra</i>. The root ऊर्णु, however is an exception and is governed by this rule, in spite of its consisting of more than one vowel. Thus प्रोर्णुतः and प्रोर्णुतवान् ॥

<i>Karika</i>:- ऊर्णु is treated as if it was नु, when the affix यङ् is to be applied, आम् is to be prohibited, or इट् is to be debarred.
