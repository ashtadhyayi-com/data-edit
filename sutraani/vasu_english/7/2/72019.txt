As धृष्टः, विशस्तः ॥ The root धृष् is exhibited in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as ञिधृषा 'to be impudent' [[5.2.2]], and as it has an indicatory आ, its past participle would be अनिट् by [[7.2.16]]. शस् is शसु in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> (1.763), and as it has an indicatory उ by [[7.2.56]]. read with [[7.2.15]], its <i>Nishtha</i> is also <i>Anit</i>. The special mention of these roots here, is for the sake of making a <i>niyama</i> rule; namely, अनिट् only then when meaning 'impudent', and सेट् in other senses : as धर्षितः, विशसितः "धृष् never forms past participle with the force of भाव (Impersonal action) or आदिकर्म (beginning of action), and therefore [[7.2.17]] cannot apply to it" - <i>This is </i>Kasika<i>. According to </i>Bhattoji<i> </i>Dikshit<i> who quotes </i>Haradatta<i> and </i>Madhava_, धृष् forms participles in those senses, when option is allowed, as, धृष्टं or धर्षितं, प्रधृष्टः or प्रधर्षितः not meaning 'impudent'.
