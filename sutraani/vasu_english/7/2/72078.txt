The सार्वधातुक affixes से and ध्वे (the endings of the Present and Imperative आत्मनेपदि) get the augment इट् after the roots ईड् - अदादिगणः (2nd Conjugation) and जन् 'to produce'.
Thus ईडिध्वे, ईडिध्वम्, ईडिषे, ईडिष्व, जनिध्वे, जनिध्वम्, जनिषे, जनिष्व ॥ The root जनी (IV. 41) is taken here. The <i>Vikarana</i> श्यन् has been elided in this case, as a Vedic irregularity, and so also there is not elision of the penultimate. In the secular literature the form is जायसे ॥ Here the य would prohibit इट् always. The जन् of the third class (III. 24) is also to be included, thus we have व्यतिजज्ञिषे, व्यतिजज्ञिष्व, व्यतिजज्ञिध्वम् in <i>karma</i> <i>vyatihara</i>. Otherwise this root is <i>Parasmaipadi</i>. ध्व takes इट् after ईश् also, as ईशिध्वम् ॥

For this purpose, some read the <i>sutra</i> as ईडजनोः स्ध्वे च; and स् stands here for से having its Locative dropped, and therefore the force of च in the <i>sutra</i>, according to this reading, is to draw in the <i>anuvritti</i> of ईश from the previous <i>sutra</i>. Those who do not follow this reading, draw the whole of the last <i>sutra</i> by force of च ॥ From these it may be asked, what is then the necessity of two <i>sutras</i> ? Could not one <i>sutra</i>, like this, is, ईशीडजनां सेध्वयोः, have sufficed, as being shorter and more general ? To this there is no better valid answer than this विचित्रा हि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः ॥

The form ध्वे being taken in the <i>sutra</i>, the rule will not apply to the ध्वम् of लङ् (Imperfect) : which will not take इट् ॥ But इट् will apply to the ध्वम् of the Imperative on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वात् ॥
