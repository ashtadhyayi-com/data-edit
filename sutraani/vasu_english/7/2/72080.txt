Thus पचेत्, पचेताम् and पचेयुः ॥ The य् of इय् is elided before affixes beginning with a consonant by [[6.1.66]]. In the case of पचेयुः, the <i>pararupa</i> of [[6.1.96]] is prevented. Why 'ending in a short अ'? Observe चिनुयात्, सुनुयात् ॥ Why 'short'? Observe यायात् ॥ Why <i>sarvadhatuka</i>? Observe चिकीर्ष्यात् ॥

The objector may say, the form चिकीर्ष्यात् will be so by the elision of अ under [[6.4.48]], and so there is no necessity of reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sarvadhatuka</i> in this <i>sutra</i>; for when अ is elided by अतोलोपः [[6.4.48]], in the case of <i>ardhadhatuka</i> या the present rule cannot apply, as there is no base left which ends in अ ॥ To this we reply, this is not a good reason: for then in the case of पचेत् and यजेत् also, the rule अतो दीर्घो यञि [[7.3.101]] would apply, and the अ of पच would require to be lengthened. But that is not so. The fact is that the present <i>sutra</i> debars rule [[7.3.101]]. Therefore, as this इय् substitute debars the lengthening of [[7.3.101]], so it would debar the <i>lopa</i> of [[6.4.48]]. Therefore, if the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>sarvadhatuka</i> be not read into this <i>sutra</i>, the इय् substitute would apply to <i>ardhadhatuka</i> also, and the <i>lopa</i>-elision [[6.4.48]] would not help, as that would be superseded by this special rule. Therefore the <i>anuvritti</i> of "<i>sarvadhatuka</i>" should be read into this <i>sutra</i>.

The above is stated on general grounds. But if the maxim मध्येऽपवादाः पूर्वान् विधीन् बाधन्ते नोत्तरान् (<i>Apavadas</i> that are surrounded by the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the <i>apavada</i> operations, supersede only those rules that precede, not those that follow them) be applied here, then the present <i>sutra</i> would supersede only the preceding <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.48]] and not the following <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.101]] for which would not be superseded by the present <i>sutra</i>. In this view also, the <i>lopa</i> being superseded at all events, the <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>Sarvadhatuka</i>' must be read into this <i>sutra</i>.

In the दीर्घ rule [[7.3.101]], the word '<i>sarvadhatuka</i>' is understood from [[7.3.95]]. But according to some, the word तिङि of [[7.3.88]] is also understood there, so that they would lengthen the अ, before a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> personal termination (तिङ्) only, and not before every <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix in general. According to this view, the present <i>sutra</i> will debar only the <i>dirgha</i> rule [[7.3.101]] and not the <i>lopa</i> rule [[6.4.48]], on the maxim येन न प्राप्ति &c.

The word येयः in the <i>sutra</i> is formed by या + इयः; and या is exhibited without any case-termination. Others say, the word is यः the sixth case of या formed on the analogy of विश्वपः by the elision of आ [[6.4.140]]. Then यः + इयः = य + इयः [[8.3.19]] after this elision, there ordinarily would take place no <i>sandhi</i>; as this elision is considered <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]] for the purposes of [[6.1.87]]. Contrary to this general rule, however, the <i>sandhi</i> takes place here and we have येयः by [[6.1.87]]. The अ in इयः is for the sake of pronunciation only. The real substitute is इय् ॥

Some read the <i>sutra</i> as अतो यासियः ॥ So that the <i>sthani</i> is यास् and not या, and यासियः is a genitive compound.
