Before the participial ending आन , a verbal अङ्ग (stem) ending in shot अ , gets the augment मुक्।
Thus पचमानः, यचमानः ॥

This मुक् is part and parcel of अ only, and not of the <i>anga</i>. For if मुक् be considered as part of the <i>anga</i>, then it will be an intervention, and make the <i>anga</i> end in a consonant and so there will be anomaly in accent. For by [[6.1.186]], the ल <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix is <i>anudatta</i> after a stem ending in अ; so if मुक् be considered part of the <i>anga</i>, the stem no longer ends in अ but म्; but if it be considered as a portion of अ only, then the <i>anga</i> still remains अदुपदेश [[6.1.186]]. So the accent of पचमानः and यजमानः is governed by (VI. I. 186).

An objector may say, "if this be so, then the stem पचम् is still considered as ending in अ, and therefore in पचम् + आन, we should apply the previous <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.81]], and change अ into इय्" ॥ To this we reply, 'no, it cannot be so; for the त् in अत् [[7.2.80]] shows that the अ consisting of one <i>matra</i> is to be taken, but when मुक्  is added, this अ becomes one <i>matra</i> and half, so the rule [[7.2.81]] will not apply; because it applies only to अ of one <i>matra</i>'. The objector:- "If this is so, then the <i>anudatta</i> of (VI. I. 186) will not also hold good, for there also the अत् means the अ of one <i>matra</i>." This is no valid objection. For there the word उपदेश is taken, so that a stem which at the time of <i>upadesa</i> or first enunciation, ends in a short अ of one <i>matra</i>, is governed by that rule; though after the enunciation, the short अ may be lengthened in its <i>matra</i>. It is for this reason that the rule [[6.1.186]] applies to पचावः and पचामः; though the short अ is subsequently lengthened before व and म by [[7.3.101]].

Or the <i>sutra</i> may have been made as आनस्य मुट्, and the augment म् would then be added to आन and not to the verbal stem. All the above difficulties would be removed by this view. But then the final अ of पच &c would require to be lengthened before मान by [[7.3.101]]. This objection, however, is not insuperable, for one view of [[7.3.101]] is that the word तिङि is understood there, so that the lengthening would take place only before a तिङ् affix beginning with a यञ् vowel : and not before any other affix.
