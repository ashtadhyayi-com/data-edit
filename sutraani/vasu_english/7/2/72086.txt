आ is substituted for the final of युष्मद् and अस्मद् before a case-ending.
The substitute case-endings are given in [[7.1.27]] &c. Thus युष्माभिः, अस्माभिः, युष्मासु, अस्मासु ॥ Why do we say 'when it is not a substitute'? Observe युष्मत् and अस्मत् (VII. I. 31). The <i>anuvritti</i>of हलि need not be read into this <i>sutra</i> from the preceding, for if that were so, the mention of अनादेशे would become redundant, because as a matter of fact no substitute case-ending begins with a consonant. However, reading this <i>sutra</i> with [[7.2.89]], we find that the scope of the present <i>sutra</i> is before consonant beginning affixes.
