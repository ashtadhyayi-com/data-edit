त्व is substituted for युष्म् and म for अस्म् when they signify a single individual, even when an affix follows or a word is in composition.
As त्वदीयः, मदीयः, with the affix छ [[4.2.114]], (I. I. 74) त्वत्तरः (= अतिशयेन त्वं), मत्तरः, त्वद्यति (= त्वामिच्छति), मद्यति; त्वद्यते (= त्वमिवाचरते), मद्यते ॥ Similarly when a second member of the compound follows. As तव पुत्रः = त्वत्पुत्रः, मत्पुत्रः ॥ त्वं नाथोऽस्य = त्वन्नाथः, मन्नाथः ॥ When more than one individual is signified, the substitution does not take place, as युष्मदीयं (= युष्माकमिदं), अस्मदीयं; युष्मत्पुत्रः (= युष्माकं पुत्रः), अस्मत्पुत्रः ॥

The <i>sutra</i> [[7.2.97]] referred to the <i>vibhaktis</i> or case-endings, as that word from [[7.2.84]] governs these <i>sutras</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> refers to other affixes, and to compounds. It might be objected, that even before other affixes and compounds these words had in them <i>vibhaktis</i>, though those <i>vibhaktis</i> were elided when these affixes were added or when the words became part of a compound; and that having in them suppressed <i>vibhaktis</i>, the substitutions would take place in spite of this <i>sutra</i>. This objection is not valid, for there the <i>vibhaktis</i> have been elided. But is not elision a <i>Bahiranga</i> and the substitute an <i>antaranga</i> process; and should not, therefore, the substitute come first and then the <i>vibhakti</i> elided? The substitution specially taught in this <i>sutra</i> is, therefore, a <i>jnapaka</i> and proves the existence of the following maxim :-  अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गोलुग्बाधते 'a <i>bahiranga</i> substitution of लुक् supersedes even <i>antaranga</i> rules'. Thus गोमान् प्रियोऽस्य = गोमत्प्रियः, here the <i>antaranga</i> नुम् augment is superseded by the <i>bahiranga</i> लुक् ॥ This <i>sutra</i> further indicates, that all other substitutes of '<i>yushmad</i>' and '<i>asmad</i>' which take place in the singular, such as तव, मम, तुभ्य, मह्य, त्व, अह, do not take effect, before general affixes or in compounds, but that त्व and म are the only substitutes there even. As तुभ्यं हितं = त्वद्धितं, मद्धितं ॥ तव पुत्रः = त्वत्पुत्रः, मत्पुत्रः ॥
