As त्यद् + सु = त्य + अ + सु [[7.2.102]] = स्य + अ + सु [[7.2.106]] = स्यः [[6.1.97]]. Similarly सः from तद्, एषः from एसद् as एतद् + सु = एत + अ + स् [[7.2.102]] = एस + अ + स् [[7.2.106]] = एषः (VI. I. 97). So असौ from अदस् by the following <i>sutra</i>. Why do we say 'non-final'? Observe हे से, सा ॥ Had not this word been used, the case-affix would not be elided in the vocative, as then there would have been no short vowel, as required by [[6.1.69]].
