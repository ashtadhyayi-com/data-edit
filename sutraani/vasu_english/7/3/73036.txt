As अर्पयति, ह्रेपयति, व्लेपयति, रेपयति, क्नोपयति, क्ष्मापयति ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of every word other than अङ्ग (VI. 4. 1.) ceases. The य् of क्नूय् and क्ष्माय् drops by [[6.1.66]]. The <i>guna</i> takes place by [[7.3.86]]. Of the roots ending in long आ, we have दापयति, धापयति ॥ The root ॠ (<i>Bhuadi</i> 983) गतिप्रापणयोः, and ॠ (<i>Juhotyadi</i> 16) गतौ are both meant here. Similarly री includes रीङ् स्रवणे (<i>Divadi</i> 30), and री गतिरेषणयोः (<i>Kryadi</i> 30). The augment is added at the end of the preceding stem of root, and not to the affix. Being added to the root it becomes part of the root-stem, and in forming the reduplicate Aorist of such stems, the vowel before प् is shortened by [[7.4.1]]. If प् were not the part of the stem, that vowel would not be shortened. Thus from दापयति; we have Aorist अदीदपत् ॥
