The word भुजः = भुज्यतेऽनेन, with घञ् [[3.3.121]]. The irregularity consists in the absence of <i>Guna</i>, as well as of gutturalisation. न्युव्जिताः शरतेऽस्मिन् = न्युव्जः from the root उव्ज अर्जवे (<i>Tudadi</i> 20). The irregularity consists in the non-changing of ज ॥ When not meaning 'an arm' and 'a disease', we have भोगः, समुद्गः ॥
