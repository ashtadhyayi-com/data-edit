As याज्यम्, वाच्यम्, रोच्यम्, प्रवाच्यम्, and अर्च्यम् ॥ Though ऋच् has a penultimate ऋ and therefore by [[3.1.110]] would have taken क्यप्, it takes ण्यत् by force of this <i>sutra</i>. प्रवच् shows that the present <i>sutra</i> applies to it, though it means 'a word or speech', and the prohibition of [[7.3.67]] does not apply. प्रवाच्य is the name of a particular book. Others say that the prohibition applies to वच् only when it is preceded by प्र, and does not mean word or speech [[7.3.67]] and not when it is preceded by any other preposition. As अविवाक्यमहरिति पठन्ति ॥ This even in a very restricted sense, namely on the tenth day of the <i>Dasaratra</i> ceremony. In other places we have अविवाच्यं ॥

Vart:- त्यज् should he enumerated in this connection i. e. before ण्यत्, the ज् remains unaltered, as त्याज्यम् ॥
