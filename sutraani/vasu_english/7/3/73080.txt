The <i>Pvadi</i> roots form a subdivision of the <i>Kryadi</i> class, beginning with पूञ् पवने (2) and ending with प्ली गतौ (32). The ल्वादि roots [[8.2.44]] are a portion of प्वादि (numbers 13 to 32). Others hold that upto the end of the <i>Kryadi</i> class are <i>Pvadi</i>. Thus पुनाति, लुणाति, स्तृणाति ॥ Those who hold that <i>Pvadi</i> roots are upto the end of the Class, explain the non-shortening of जानाति (for ज्ञा would also then become <i>Pvadi</i>), by saying that the express text of [[7.3.79]], substituting long जा prevents the shortening. They say had ज्ञा been also shortened, then merely ज substitute would have been enough and not जा; and this ज would have been lengthened in the case of जन् by [[7.3.101]], to form जायते ॥
