गुण is substituted before a सार्वधातुक and an आर्धधातुक affix for the इक् vowels of the Causative अङ्ग (stems) which take the augment प् -- अर्त्तिह्रीब्लीरीक्नूयीक्ष्माय्यातां पुङ्णौ [[7.3.36]], and for the short penultimate vowel of a root which ends in a single consonant.
<i>Karika</i>:-

संयोगे गुरुसंज्ञायां गुणो भेत्तुर्न सिध्यति ।
विध्यपेक्षं लघोश्चासौ कथं कुण्डिर्न दुष्यति ॥
धातोर्हिनुम कथं रञ्जे, स्यदिश्रथ्योर्निपातनात् ।
अनङ्लोपशिदीर्घत्वे विध्यपेक्षे न सिध्यतः ॥
अभ्यस्तस्य यदाहाचि लङर्थं तत्कृतं भवेत् ।
क्नुसनो यत्कृतं कित्त्वं ज्ञापकं स्याल्लघोर्गुणे ॥

As व्लेपयति, ह्रेपयति, क्रोपयति, भेदनम्, छेदनम्, भेत्ता, छेत्ता ॥ Of course the vowel should be <i>laghu</i> or light, before the addition of the affix; the heaviness caused by the addition of the affix, will not prevent. Thus भिद् + तृ, though द् + तृ = त्तृ  causes the इ to become heavy, that will not prevent <i>guna</i>: for विध्यपेक्षं लघुग्रहणम् ॥ Objection : If this be so, why the forms कुण्डितृ, हुण्डितृ are not incorrect, for in them also the vowel is <i>laghu</i> (the roots are कुड् and हुड्), and the augment म् is added afterwards by a <i>Vidhi</i> rule? Answer: The augment म् is added to the root, and becomes <i>upadesivat</i>. (See [[7.1.58]]). Objection: If so, how do you cause <i>Vriddhi</i> in रञ्ज्, as in रागः with घञ्; as रञ्ज् + घञ् = रज् + घञ् (the ञ् being dropped by [[6.4.27]]), for it is after the elision of ञ्, that the of रज् becomes penultimate and can admit of <i>Vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.116]]? Answer: The exceptional forms स्यदः from स्यन्द् + घञ्, and श्रथः from श्रन्थ + घञ्, taught in (Vl. 4. 28); [[6.4.29]] teach by implication that roots of this form take <i>Vriddhi</i> as a general rule. Objection: If the विध्यपेक्ष maxim is not of universal application: though by [[6.4.134]], the अ of अन् &c. is elided in <i>bha</i> stems, like राजन् thus राज्ञा; yet the अ shoud not be elided if you be consistent, in आनङ् augment added by [[7.1.75]] to दधि, अस्थि &c. In fact, you could not get the forms दध्ना सक्थ्ना &c. Moreover though there can be the lengthening of the penultimate in सामन् = सामानि (before शि affix Nominative Plural), yet not in the case of कुण्डानि from कुण्ड for here न् is added by another rule [[7.1.72]]. If you say, the maxim is not of universal application, then there can be no <i>guna</i> of इ in भिद् to form भेत्तृ ॥ Answer: The <i>guna</i> takes place in forms like भेत्तृ &c, because the prohibition of the following rule [[7.3.87]], with regard to the affixes beginning with a vowel, proves by implication that before affixes beginning with a consonant, as तृ, the <i>guna</i> also takes place. Objection: The prohibition in the case of vowel beginning affixes is for the sake of लङ्, to form अनेनेक् ॥ This is derived from निजिर् (<i>Juhotyadi</i> 11), in the Imperfect, as अ + निज् + शप्श्लु + तिप् then reduplication (VI. I. 10), then <i>guna</i> of the reduplicate, [[7.4.75]], then तिप् which had become त in the Imperfect, is elided by [[6.1.68]]. Thus अनिज् + श्लु + त् = अ + निनिज् + त् [[6.1.10]] = अ नेनिज् + त् [[7.4.75]] = अ नेनिज् [[6.1.98]] = अननक्. The elided त् produces its effect, the <i>guna</i> by [[7.3.86]]. This is why अच् is taken in <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.87]], namely अजादि affixes do not cause <i>guna</i>, the हलादि affixes like त् cause <i>guna</i>. You cannot therefore say that अचि in [[7.3.87]] is a <i>jnapaka</i>. Answer: The <i>sutra</i> त्रसिगृधिधृषिक्षिपेः क्नुः [[3.2.140]] teaches the addition of नु to त्रस् &c, as गृध्नुः; if this नु had not tended to cause the <i>guna</i> of the penultimate vowels of these roots, what was the necessity of making this affix a कित्? Similarly [[1.2.10]] teaches that सन् (Desiderative) is कित् after roots ending in consonants. These rules show that words like भत &c get <i>guna</i>, and the final consonant of the root plus the initial consonant of the affix, does not make the root vowel heavy. Objection: The कित् of सन् is for the sake of the elision of the nasal, in धिप्सति, धाप्सति [[6.4.24]]. Answer: Let it be so: still the कित् of क्नु is enough for us.

The "<i>upadha</i> short" must be the vowels of the इक् <i>pratyahara</i>. Therefore in भिनत्ति, the penultimate is short अ (of श्नम्) and it does not take <i>guna</i>. In fact, the word penultimate qualifies the word इक् understood. Others explain it by saying that पुगन्त is to be analysed by पुकि अन्त "in the vicinity of प्" ॥ The word अन्त means समीप, and means the इक् vowel in the proximity of पुक् ॥ The word लघूपधा should be analysed as लघ्वी उपधा and is a <i>Karmadharaya</i> compound, and means "a short or light penultimate". The word पुगन्तलघूपध is a <i>Samahara</i> <i>Dvandva</i>.
