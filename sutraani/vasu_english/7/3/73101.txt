As पचामि, पचावः, पचामः, पक्ष्यामि, पक्ष्यावः, पक्ष्यामः ॥ Why 'for the अ only'? Observe चिनुवः, चिनुमः ॥ Why before a यञ् consonant (semivowels, nasals and झ and भ) only? Observe पचतः, पचथः ॥ Why a '<i>Sarvadhatuka</i>'? Observe अङ्गना, केशवः ॥ Some read the <i>anuvritti</i> of तिङ् into this <i>sutra</i>, from [[7.3.88]] so that the lengthening takes place only before Personal-endings. According to them before क्वसु there is no lengthening, as भववान् ॥

The word भववान् is thus formed. To भू is added क्वसु, then comes शप्, treating <i>kvasu</i> as a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> under [[3.4.117]]; the reduplication of the root ending in शप् is prevented, because the word <i>dhatu</i> is used in [[6.1.8]] which ordains reduplication of a root only, and not of a root plus a <i>vikarana</i> like the form भव (भू + शप्) ॥ Those who do not read the <i>anuvritti</i> of तिङ् in this <i>sutra</i>, but only of the word सार्वधातुके, they explain the form भववान् as a Vedic anomaly.
