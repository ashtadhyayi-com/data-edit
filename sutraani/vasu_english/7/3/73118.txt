As सख्यौ, पत्यौ ॥

In the case of नदी words आम् is taught by the previous <i>sutras</i>; in the case of घी words औ preceded by अ substitution of घि letters will be taught in the next <i>sutra</i>, so by the rule of exclusion, the present <i>sutra</i> applies to words other than <i>nadi</i> and <i>ghi</i>.
