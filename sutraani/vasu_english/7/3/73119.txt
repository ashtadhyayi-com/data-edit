As अग्नौ, वायौ, कृतौ, धेनौ, पटौ ॥ The short अ is substituted, in order to prevent the टाप् affix in the Feminine. Those who read 118 and 119 combined as औदच्च घेः translate it thus: "After every other stem ending in इ and उ (i. e. which is not a <i>Nadi</i>), औ is substituted for the Locative Singular इ, whereby for the final of <i>Ghi</i> stems, अ is substituted". They do so on the analogy of the <i>sutra</i> कर्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च [[3.1.11]].
