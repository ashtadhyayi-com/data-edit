As अग्निना, वायुना, पटुना ॥ Why do we not say आङो मा पुंसि 'मा is substituted for आ in the Masculine'? Answer: In order to form the neuter Instrumentals also, as त्रपुणा, जतुना ॥ Objection: These can be formed by the augment नुम् under rule [[7.1.73]], and not by the ना of this <i>sutra</i>. Answer: But अमुना will not be so formed as अमुना ब्राह्मणकुले ॥ Because सु substituted for दस् of अदस् [[8.2.80]] is considered as <i>asiddha</i> or non-existent [[8.2.1]] for the purposes of the application [[7.1.73]], and as अमु cannot take नुम्, it will take ना by this rule. Why do we say "not in the Feminine?" Observe कृत्या, धेन्वा ॥
