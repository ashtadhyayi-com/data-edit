Short ऋ is optionally substituted for the penultimate ऋ and ॠ of a Causative अङ्ग (stem) in the reduplicated Aorist.
This debars the इर् [[7.3.101]], अर् [[7.3.86]], and आर् [[7.2.114]] substitutes. Thus अचिकीर्तत् (VII. I. 101) or अचिकिर्तत् from कॄत् (<i>Churadi</i> III) : अववर्तत् [[7.3.86]], or अवीवृतत्; अममार्जत् [[7.2.114]] or अमीमृजत् ॥ Though the इर्, अर् and आर् substitutes are <i>antaranga</i> operations, they are prohibited by the express text of this <i>sutra</i>. The short ऋ is substituted even for a long ॠ : the त् of ऋत् shows that, as in अचीकृतत् [[8.2.77]]. In fact, this ऋ substitute does not take place after the operations of इर्, अर् and आर् substitutions have taken effect, but it is a form which suspends the operation of all those rules.
