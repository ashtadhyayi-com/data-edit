As ज्ञका, [[7.3.47]] कुमारिका, किशोरिका, ब्रह्मबन्धुका ॥ Why आ, ई and ऊ only? Observe गोका, नौका ॥ The words राका, धाका are irregular being formed by <i>Unadi</i> diversity, with the affix क added to रा and धा (<i>Unadi</i> Ill. 40). By the following <i>sutra</i>, the rule does not apply to the affix कप्; it therefore implies that कन् is governed by this rule, though it has the <i>anubandha</i> न् ॥ <i>Katyayana</i> would confine this rule to the <i>Taddhita</i> क, and not the <i>krit</i> क of the <i>Unadi</i>, as राका, धाका; but <i>Unadi</i> words are not derivatives (उणादयोऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि), and hence no necessity of reading <i>Taddhita</i> into the <i>sutra</i>.
