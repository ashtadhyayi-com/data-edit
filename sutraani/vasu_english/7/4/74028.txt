The word लिङि in the aphorism is qualified by the phrase यकारादौ सार्वधातुके ॥ A <i>Lin</i> affix which begins with a य and is not a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i>, is necessarily the augment यास् of the Benedictive. Thus श-आ द्रियते and आ घ्रियते (the व् comes by [[6.4.77]]). यक्-क्रियते, ह्रियते ॥ लिङ्-क्रियात् and ह्रियात् ॥ This short रि debars the long  री of the last. The word non-<i>Sarvadhatuka</i> being understood, the rule does not apply to the Potential, as बिभृयात् ॥ The यि [[7.4.22]] is understood here also, therefore when the Benedictive affix does not begin with य्, the rule does not apply, as कृषीष्ट, हृषीष्ट ॥
