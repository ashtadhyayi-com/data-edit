The word छन्दसि is drawn in to this <i>sutra</i>, by force of च ॥ The form दाधर्त्ति, is either from the Causative of the root धृङ् अवस्थाने or from धृञ्, in the श्लु or यङ् लुक्, there is lengthening of the <i>abhyasa</i> and elision of णि ॥ (2) So also दर्धर्त्ति is the form in <i>slu</i>, with रुक् augment of the <i>abhyasa</i>. (3) दर्धर्षि if it be a form of यङ् लुक्, there is no irregularity. (4) बोभूतु is from भू in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), Imperative, irregularly without <i>guna</i>. Question: There is no necessity of including this, because there would be no <i>guna</i> regularly even under [[7.3.88]]? Answer: The inclusion of बोभूतु is a <i>jnapaka</i>, indicating that in every other case, the <i>guna</i> is not prohibited in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), as बोभेति, बोभवीति (लट् with ईट् [[7.3.94]]) (5) तेतिक्तं is from तिज् in the Intensive <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>, <i>atmanepada</i> is irregular. Question: The यङ् is ङित् and therefore by <i>pratyaya</i> <i>lakshana</i> rule [[1.1.62]] read with [[1.3.12]], the यङ् लुक् will be <i>atmanepadi</i>, where is the necessity of reading this <i>nipatan</i>? Answer: The <i>atmanepada</i> <i>nipatan</i> is a <i>jnapaka</i>, that in the Intensive <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i> the <i>atmanepada</i> affixes are not employed. (6) अलर्षि is from the root ॠ (इयर्ति), in Present, 2nd Person, the र् of <i>abhyasa</i> is not elided, though required by [[7.4.60]], and this र् is changed to ल irregularly. This form is found in the 3rd Person also, as अलर्त्ति दक्षः ॥ (7) आ पमीफणत् is from फण् with आ augment, and शतृ affix is added to यङ् लुक्, and in the reduplicate मी is added. (8) संसनिष्यदत् is from स्यन्द with the Preposition सम्, in the Intensive yan <i>luk</i>, with शतृ affix, नि being added in the <i>abhyasa</i>, the root स is changed to ष ॥ The Preposition सं is not absolutely necessary, with other Prepositions also we have this form, as आ तमिष्यदत् ॥ (9) करिक्रत् is from कृ (करोति), in the Intensive <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>, with शतृ, in the <i>abhyasa</i> there is no palatal change [[7.4.62]], and रि is added to the reduplicate. (10) कनिक्रदत् from क्रन्द् in the Aorist with अङ्, reduplication, there is no <i>chutva</i> ( VII. 4. 62) of the reduplicate, and the augment नि is added. In the secular literature, the form is अक्रन्दीत् ॥ (11) भरिभ्रत् from भृ (बिभर्ति) in <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i> with शतृ, without इ of [[7.4.76]], without <i>jastva</i>, and रि is added to the reduplicate. (12) दविध्वतः from ध्वृ (ध्वरते) in the <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>, <i>satr</i>, plural number Nominative. The रि is added to the reduplicate, the ऋ is elided, दविध्वतः रश्मयः सूर्यस्य ॥ (13) दविद्युतम् is from <i>dyut</i>, <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i> with <i>satr</i>, there is no vocalisation of the reduplicate, with अ change and वि augment, (14) तरित्रतः from तृ (तरति) with <i>slu</i>, <i>satr</i>, genitive singular: and रि added to <i>abhyasa</i>. (15) सरीसृपत् from सृप् with <i>slu</i>, <i>satr</i>, Accusative with री added to <i>abhyasa</i>. (16) वरीवृजत् from वृज् with <i>slu</i>, <i>satr</i> and री augment. (17) मर्मृज from मृज् with लिट् (Perfect) णल्, म् added to <i>abhyasa</i>, and य added to the root, and there is no <i>vriddhi</i>, because there is no short penultimate now. In fact [[7.2.114]] is to be qualified by the words लघूपध from [[7.3.86]]. (18) आ गनीगन्ति is from गम् with the Preposition आ, in the Perfect, with <i>slu</i>, there is no <i>chutva</i> ( VII. 4. 62), and augment मी is added. वक्ष्यन्ती वेदा गनीगन्ति कर्णम् ॥

The word इति in the aphorism indicates that other forms, similar to these, are also to be included.
