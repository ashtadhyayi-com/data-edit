As तन्तन्यते and तन्तनीति; जङ्गम्यते and जङ्गमीति, यंयम्यते and यंयमीति; रंरम्यते and रंरमीति ॥ The augment न् here should be considered as <i>anusvara</i>, because an <i>adesa</i> is indicated by the nature of the <i>sthanin</i> which is replaced; and therefore in यंयम्यते, it remains <i>anusvara</i>. Had it been म्, it could not have been changed to <i>anusvara</i> in यंयम्यते, रंरम्यते (See [[8.3.24]]). In तन्तन्यते &c, the <i>anusvara</i> is changed to न्, ङ् &c, by [[8.4.58]]; the other forms तन्तन्यते तंतनीति, जंगम्यते, जंगमीति are derived by the following :-

Vart:- This <i>anusvara</i> should be treated as if it was at the end of a <i>Pada</i> or word. That being so, [[8.4.59]] applies, and we have the <i>anusvara</i> unchanged, as in तंतन्यते &c.

Why do we say "after a short अ"? Observe तेतिम्यते ॥ The त् in अत् indicates that the augment will not be added to a reduplicate which once was long आ but became short by [[7.4.59]] as from भाम 'to be angry', is बाभाम्यते, (the second lengthening takes place by [[7.4.83]]). Why do we say ending in a nasal? Observe पापच्यते ॥
