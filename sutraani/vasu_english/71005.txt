अत् is always the substitute of झ in the आत्मनेपद when it is not preceded by a verbal अङ्ग (stem) ending in अ।
Thus चिन्वते, चिन्वताम्, अचिन्वत; लुनते, लुनताम्, अलुनत ॥ Why in the <i>Atmanepada</i>? Observe चिन्वन्ति, लुनन्ति ॥ Why "when not preceded by an अ"? Observe च्यवन्ते, प्लवन्ते, in which, though the roots are च्यु and प्लु, they assume the form च्यव and प्लव when the <i>Vikarana</i> शप् is added; the <i>vikarana</i> is added first, because it is <i>nitya</i>; and then the substitution of अन्त or अत for झ, as the case may be. The word अनतः qualifies झ, the झ should be immediately preceded by a stem ending in a non-अ; if some other letter intervenes, the rule will not apply. Thus from शी - शयान्तै, here between शी and झ, intervenes the augment आट्, therefore झ is not preceded by a stem ending in non अ, but by आट् ॥
