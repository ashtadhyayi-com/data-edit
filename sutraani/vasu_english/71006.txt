The अत् substitute of झ gets the रुट् augment after the root शी।
Thus शेरते, शेरताम्, अशेरत ॥ The augment र् is added at the beginning of the affix, making अत् = रत् ॥ Had this र् been an augment of झ, then like the आट् augment in शयान्तै, it would have intervened between the शी and झ, and झ not immediately following a non-अ stem, अत् would not have been substituted for झ at all. Therefore रुट् is made the augment of the substitute अत, and not of झ ॥ The root शी is read in the <i>sutra</i> with its <i>anubandha</i> ङ् in order to indicate, that there is no रुट् augment when there is elision of the Intensive affix यङ्, nor any <i>Guna</i>. As व्यति शेश्यते ॥

It is a general rule that an operation applying to a root which is exhibited with an <i>anubandha</i>, will not apply to the same root in its Intensive-<i>yan</i>-<i>luk</i> form. The following verse shows when operations applying to simple roots will not apply to their Intensive forms:--

श्तिपा शपानुबन्धेन निर्दिष्टं यद्गणेन च ।
यत्रैकाज् ग्रहणं चैव पंचैतानि न यङ्लुकि ॥

"These five sorts of operations will not apply to Intensive-<i>yan</i>-<i>luk</i> forms: 1. When the simple root is exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> with श्तिप् as भू in [[7.4.73]] is shown as भवति ॥ In Intensive, the perfect will be बोभवाञ्चकार and not बभवाञ्चकार ॥ 2. Where the root is exhibited with शप्, as the root भृ in [[7.2.49]] is shown as भर ॥ There is इट् after the Desiderative of simple root but not in Intensive. 3. When a simple root is exhibited with an <i>anubhandha</i>, as शीङ् here. 4. Where a <i>gana</i> is mentioned in a rule, as श्यन् is taught after <i>Divadi</i>-roots [[3.1.69]]. It will apply to simple roots of <i>Divadi</i> <i>gana</i>, and not to their Intensive. 5. Lastly, where the word एकाच् is used in a <i>sutra</i>. As [[7.2.10]]. That rule will apply to एकाच् simple roots and not to their Intensives.
