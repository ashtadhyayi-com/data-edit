After a nominal अङ्ग (stem) ending in अ, ऐस् is substituted for the case-ending भिस्।
<i>Karika</i>

एत्वं भिसि परत्वाश्चेदत ऐस्क्व भविष्यति ।
कृतेप्येत्वे भौतपूर्व्यादैस्तु नित्यस्तथा सति ॥

As वृक्षैः, प्लक्षैः, अतिजरसैः ॥ Why do we say ending in अ? Observe अग्निभिः, वायुभिः ॥ Why 'short अ'? Observe खट्वाभिः, मालाभिः ॥  The <i>adhikara</i> of "अतः" ('after a short अ'), extends up to [[7.1.17]].

The form अतिजरसैः illustrates some important principles of grammar.  अति + जरा = (जरामतिक्रान्तः) अतिजर (अ being shortened by [[1.2.48]]). The word अतिजर ends in अ, and there fore forms its Instrumental plural by ऐस् ॥ Thus अतिजर + ऐस् ॥ Now we apply [[7.2.101]], which says for जरा is substituted जरस् before vowel-beginning case-endings. It should not be objected, that the substitution is ordained for जरा and not जर; for the maxim एकदेशविकृतमनन्यवद् भवति (a tail-less dog is still a dog) applies here. Having made this substitution, we get अतिजरसैः ॥ Nor should you object that it was the अ of जर which had given occasion to the existence of ऐस्, and that अ should not be destroyed, on the maxim संनिपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद् विघातस्य, for this maxim is not universal, as <i>Panini</i> himself shows in employing the form कष्टाय [[3.1.14]], in which ए of the Dative is changed into य by [[7.1.13]], and then this very य causes the destruction of अ and makes it आ (See [[7.1.13]] also).

<i>Karika</i>:- If there be substitution of ए for the final  अ before the affix भिस् by the subsequent <i>sutra</i> [[7.3.103]], where will then the present <i>sutra</i>, causing the substitution of ऐस् for भिस् after stems ending in अ, find its scope, (because there will be no stem left ending in अ)? If even after changing अ into ए, you change the भिस् into ऐस्, because the ए was once अ (भौतपूर्व्यात्); then the rule of changing भिस् into ऐस् becomes a <i>nitya</i> rule, because it takes effect even after the application of rule [[7.3.103]], and being <i>nitya</i> it debars that rule. Thus वृक्ष + भिस् ॥ Here the subsequent rule [[7.3.103]], requires the अ to be changed into ए ॥ Thus वृक्षे + भिः Now the present rule cannot apply because there is no अदन्त stem. However, is considering that वृक्षे once was अदन्त, we change भिः to ऐस् then the rule becomes a <i>nitya</i> rule. In fact, it is a <i>nitya</i> rule and debars the application of [[7.3.103]], within its jurisdiction, [[7.3.103]], finds its scope in वृक्ष + सु = वृक्षेषु ॥
