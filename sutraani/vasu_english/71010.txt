In the छन्दस् (Vedas) the substitution takes place diversely.
That is ऐस् is substituted for भिस् even after stems which do not end in short अ; as नद्यः; and some times the substitution does not take place even after stems ending in short अ, as, देवेभिः सर्वेभिः प्रोक्तम् ॥ देवो देवोभिरागमत् (<i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> I.1.4).
