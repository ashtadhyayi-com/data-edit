This substitution of ऐस् does not take place after 1. इदम् and 2. अदस् except when they end in क।
As एभिः, अमीभिः, but इमकैः, अमुकैः ॥ By [[7.2.102]], अ is substituted for the final of इदम्, as इद + अ = इद [[6.1.97]]. By [[7.2.113]], the इद् is elided before भिस्, and the only portion left is अ, which becomes ए according to [[7.3.103]]. For the final of अदस् is similarly by [[7.2.102]], अ substituted, and अद + अ = अद [[6.1.97]], and according to our present <i>sutra</i>, the form in Instrumental plural would be अदेभिः, but द् is changed to म् by [[8.2.80]], and ए to ई by [[8.2.81]].

The exception made with regard to these forms ending in क, shows the existence of the following maxim : तद्मध्यपतितस्तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यते "Any term that may be employed in Grammar denotes not merely what is actually denoted by it, but it denotes also whatever word-form may result when something is inserted in that which is actually denoted by it."

The <i>sutra</i> has not been made as इदमदसोः कात्, for had it been so constructed the rule would have applied to the क ending इदम् and अदस् and to no other क ending pronoun, and we could not get the forms सर्वकैः, विश्वकैः ॥  Moreover such a construction would have made ऐस् applicable to इदम् and अदस् also in their simple states : i. e. we could not have got the forms एभिः or अमीभिः ॥ Therefore the negative construction न अकोः is used in <i>sutra</i> in order to prevent the rule of contrariety.
