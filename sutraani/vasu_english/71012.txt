After a अङ्ग (stem) ending in अ are substituted इन् for the Instrumental -3rd case ending; आ (आत्) for the Ablative -5th case ending अस् and स्य for the Genitive 6th-Case ending अस्।
Thus वृक्षेण and प्लक्षेण; वृक्षात् and प्लक्षात्; and वृक्षस्य and प्लक्षस्य ॥ After stems not ending in अ we have the original ending, as पत्या, सख्या ॥ Some would have the forms अतिजरसिन and अतिजरसात् from अतिजर ॥ This is on the analogy of अतिजरसैः [See <i>Sutra</i> 9 <i>ante</i>]. Thus अति + जरा = अतिजर [[1.2.48]]. Then by [[7.2.101]], जरस् is substituted for जर before the vowel-affixes. These forms are not supported however by <i>Patanjali</i>. According to him the forms will be either अतिजरेण, अतिजरात्, or अतिजरसा and अतिजरसः but never अतिजरसिन and अतिजरसात् ॥
