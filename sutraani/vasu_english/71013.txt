After a अङ्ग (stem) ending in अ are substituted there is substituted य for the Dative -4th Case ending ए।
Thus वृक्षाय, प्लक्षाय, the अ is lengthended by [[7.3.102]], in spite of the maxim संनिपातलक्षणो विधि रनिमित्तम् तद्विधातस्य ॥ "That which is taught in a rule the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination". Thus य is substituted here, because the preceding word ends in a short अ, thus this short अ occasioned the existence of य, therefore this य cannot occasion the destruction of अ ॥  But that however it does, for it is on account of this य, that the preceding अ is replaced by आ ॥

The ङेः is the anomalous genitive case of the Dative ending ङे; this affix is exhibited without any <i>vibhakti</i> in [[7.1.28]]. The ङेः should not be taken as the Genitive singular of ङि the affix of the Locative singular.
