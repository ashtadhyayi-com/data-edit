After a Pronominal अङ्ग (stem) ending in अ , स्मै is substituted for the Dative -4th Case ending ए।
As सर्वस्मै, विश्वस्मै, यस्मै, कस्मै, तस्मै ॥ But भवते where the Pronoun does not end in अ ॥ When अश् is substituted for इदम् [[2.4.32]] in <i>anvadesa</i> sentences, then we have the form अस्मै ॥ But in अत्र इदम् + ङे = अत्र अ + ए = अत्रा + ए, here the preceding word ends in आ and we could not have ए replaced by स्मै ॥ Therefore we infer that स्मै being an <i>antaranga</i> operation should be substituted first, and the <i>sandhi</i> afterward and we get अत्रास्मै ॥ (See [[7.2.102]]) for the change of यद्, तद् &c into य, त &c). The change of ए into स्मै is <i>antaranga</i> as it depends upon one word, while the एकादेश long आ is <i>bahiranga</i> because it is an operation depending upon two words.
