After a neutral अङ्ग (stem), ई is substituted for the dual endings औ of Nominative 1st-Case and Accusative -2nd case.
Thus कुण्डेः तिष्ठतः, कुण्डे पश्य ॥  कुण्ड + ई = कुण्डे, the अ of कुण्ड required to be elided by [[6.4.148]]. This is, however, not done by the following

Vart:- Prohibition should be stated in the case of the affix शी ॥ Therefore the अ is not elided.

Similarly दधिनी, मधुनी, त्रपुणी, जतुनी ॥ The augment न् is added by [[7.1.73]].
