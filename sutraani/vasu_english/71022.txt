The Nominative 1st-Case and Accusative -2nd case plural endings are elided after the numerals calls षष् -- ष्णान्ता षट् [[1.1.24]].
As षट् तिष्ठन्ति, षट् पश्य, पञ्च, सप्त, नव, दश ॥ The rule applies even to compounds ending with '<i>shash</i>' words : as परमषट्, उत्तमषट्, but the '<i>shash</i>' should be the principal; if it is only a secondary member of the compound, the rule will not apply: as प्रियषषः, प्रियपञ्चानः ॥ For the elision of न् see [[8.2.7]].
