In the छन्दस् (Vedas) अत् (or अद्) is not the substitute of सु and अम् Nominative 1st-Case and Accusative -2nd case endings after इतर।
As इतरमितरमण्डमजायत; वार्त्रघ्नमितरम् ॥ Why in the Vedas? See इतरत् काष्ठम्, इतरत् कुड्यम् ॥ Had this <i>sutra</i> been placed immediately after अतोऽम् [[7.1.24]], we could have made it simpler by saying इतराच्छन्दसि; the present position of the <i>sutra</i> indicates that we should divide it into two, to include other cases. In the case of एकतर, the अदड् substitution does not take place, either in the <i>Veda</i> or in the Common Language. As एकतरं तिष्ठति, एकतरं पश्य ॥
