अभ्यम् is substituted for the Dative -4th Case ending भ्यस् after the अङ्ग (stems) युष्मद् and अस्मद्।
As युष्मभ्यम् and अस्मभ्यम् ॥ As the <i>sutra</i> is constructed (भ्यसो भ्यम्) it is not easy to say whether the substitute is भ्यम् or अभ्यम् ॥ If it is भ्यम्, then we have two cases, (1) eliding the final द् of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, by [[7.2.90]]; and adding भ्यम् (2) eliding अद् of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>¬ by [[7.2.90]], and adding भ्यम् ॥ It will be shown hereafter that [[7.2.90]], is capable of two explanations, one by which <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> lose their द् only, and by another अद् ॥ Similarly with  अभ्यम् we have also two cases : Thus we have four cases, as (1) <i>yushma</i> + <i>bhyam</i>, (2) <i>yushm</i> + <i>bhyam</i>, (3) <i>yushma</i> + <i>abhyam</i>, (4) <i>yushm</i> + <i>abhyam</i>. In the case of the first (<i>yushma</i> + <i>bhyam</i>) we can get the proper form, though it may be objected that <i>yushma</i> + <i>bhyam</i> should be equal to युष्मेभ्यम् by [[7.3.103]]: this ए substitution will not take place, however, by force of the maxim अङ्गवृत्त पुनर्वृत्तावविधिर्निर्दिष्ठितस्य "when an operation which is taught in the <i>angadhikara</i> has taken place, and another operation of the <i>angadhikara</i> is subsequently applicable, this latter operation is not allowed to take place."

The second case is an impossibility, namely, <i>yushm</i> + <i>bhyam</i> can give us no form. The third case <i>yushma</i> + <i>abhyam</i> will give us the proper form  युष्म꣡भ्यम् (अ + अ = अ by [[6.1.97]]). Moreover the accent also will be on the middle युष्मभ्यम् by [[6.1.161]], the <i>udatta</i> अ of <i>yushma</i> being elided by the <i>anudatta</i> अ of अभ्यम्, the acute will be on the <i>anudatta</i> अ ॥ It should not be objected that in [[6.1.161]], the word अन्त of [[6.1.159]] is understood, and the accent will be on the final. We have shown in that <i>sutra</i>, that the <i>udatta</i> will fall on the आदि (beginning) of the <i>anudatta</i> term which causes the elision. The fourth alternative <i>yushm</i> + <i>abhyam</i> is free from all objections.
