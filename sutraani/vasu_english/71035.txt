तातङ् is optionally substituted for the affixes तु and हि of the Imperative, when Benediction is meant.
As जीवताद् भवान्, जीवतात् त्वम्, जीवतु भवान्, जीव त्वम् ॥ The ङ् prevents <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i>, [[1.1.4]], and the substitute replaces the whole affix ([[1.1.53]] notwithstanding). The substitute is not <i>sthanivat</i> पित्, though it replaces a पित् affix, because it has its own indicatory letter ङ्, and ङित् does not become पित्; and consequently in ब्रूतात् ई is not added to the affix, by [[7.3.93]]. ई being added only to पित् affixes after ब्रू ॥ When not denoting benediction, we have not this substitution : as ग्रामं गच्छतु भवान् or गच्छ ग्रामम् ॥

The affix तातङ् being a substitute of हि, is like हि, and, therefore, rules propounded with regard to हि, will apply to तातङ् also. Thus [[6.4.105]] says that after stems ending in short अ, the हि is elided: therefore, after such words तातङ् should also be elided. Therefore we cannot get the form जीवतात् त्वम् for जीवत्वम् ॥ This objection, however, is futile; for, in the <i>sutra</i> अतो हे (V1.4. 105), there is the <i>anuvritti</i> of हि from <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.101]] (हु झलभ्यो हेर्द्धिः) ॥ So that अतो हे should be construed as meaning "there is the elision of हि when it is of the form हि, and not when it assumes the form तातङ्" ॥

The object of ङ् in तातङ् is, as we have said above, for the sake of preventing <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i>. It should not be said that the object of ङ् in तातङ् is for the sake of अन्त्यविधिः by the application of <i>sutra</i> ङिच्च (1.1. 53), just as the substitutes अनङ् &c [[7.1.93]] and [[7.1.94]] apply to the finals. For by so doing, तातङ् would replace only the उ of तु and the इ of हि, which is not desired. And the case of तातङ् is to be distinguished from अनङ्, for in अनङ् the ङ् has no other object but to prevent <i>sarvadesa</i>; but in तातङ् we see that ङ् has another object, namely, the prevention of <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i> ; and ङ् having thus found scope, the तातङ् substitute will be governed by the general rule अनेकाल् शित् सर्वस्य [[1.1.55]].

The <i>Karika</i> given below raises these points.

<i>Karika</i> :-

तातङि ङित्त्वं संक्रमकृत्स्यादन्त्यविधिश्चेत्तच्च तथा न ।
हेरधिकारे हेरधिकारो लोपविधौ तु ज्ञापकमाह ॥
तातङो ङित्त्वसामर्थ्यान्नायमन्त्यविधिः स्मृतः ।
न तद्वदनङादीनां तेन तेऽन्त्यविकारजाः ॥

<i>Karika</i>:- In तातङ् the ङ् is for the sake of preventing <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i> (संक्रम = गुणवृद्धिप्रतिषेधः)॥ If it be said, it is for the sake of अन्त्यविधि by [[1.1.53]]; we say it is not so. (If you say that after roots ending in short अ, तात् should be elided, by [[6.4.105]] read with [[1.1.56]], we reply): when the <i>anuvritti</i> or <i>adhikara</i> of हि was already existent in the <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.105]] from <i>sutra</i> [[6.4.101]], the express employment of हि in [[6.4.105]], indicates that the <i>lopa</i> rule does not apply to तातङ् ॥ (The <i>lopa</i>-rule not applying to तातङ्, it follows that it replaces the whole of हि and not only its final). The ङ् in तातङ् finds its scope in preventing <i>Guna</i> and <i>Vriddhi</i>, therefore, it is not for the sake of <i>antya</i> <i>vidhi</i> [[1.1.53]]. The ङित्व in अनङ् &c has no other scope, therefore, these substitutes replace the final only.
