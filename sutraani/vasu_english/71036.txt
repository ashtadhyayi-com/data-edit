वसु is substituted for the Present Participle affix शतृ after the root विद् 'to know'.
Thus विद्वस् (nominative singular विद्वान्), विद्वांसौ, विद्वांसः ॥ The words formed with affixes having an indicatory उ or ऋ (उगित्) add a म् in their strong cases [[7.1.70]], and form their feminine with unaccented ई ॥ शतृ is an affix having an indicatory ऋ, therefore its substitute would also be considered as having an indicatory ऋ, the उ of वसु therefore is not absolutely necessary for the purposes of उगित् operations. वसु is so written, in order that in the <i>sutra</i> वसो संप्रसारणं [[6.4.131]], both क्वसु and वसु should be included. Nor can we object that in the above mentioned <i>sutra</i>, वसु with one indicatory letter being taken, cannot include an affix like क्वसु having two indicatory letters, -- on the maxim एकानुबन्धकग्रहणे न द्व्यनुबन्धकस्य -- for if that were so, there was no necessity of उ in वसु ॥ Some read the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word optionally into this : and we have विदन्, विदन्तौ, विदन्तः formed with शतृ (see [[5.4.38]]).
