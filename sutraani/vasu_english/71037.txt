In a compound, the first member of which is an indeclinable but not नञ् ; ल्यप् is substituted for क्त्वा।
Thus प्रकृत्य, प्रह्रत्य ॥ The <i>tva</i> is added by [[3.4.21]], the compounding is by [[2.2.18]], and तुक् by [[6.1.71]]. पार्स्वतः कृत्य, The <i>tva</i> is added by [[3.4.61]]. and compounding is by [[2.2.22]]. नानाकृत्य; द्विधाकृत्य The <i>tva</i> is added by [[3.4.62]]. Why do we say 'in a compound'? Observe कृत्वा हुत्वा. Here the counter example is हृत्वा, which is preceded by an Indeclinable कृत्वा, but as it is not compounded, there is no substitution. Why do we say 'not preceded by नञ्'? Observe अकृत्वा, अहृत्वा, परमकृत्वा, उत्तमकृत्वा ॥ The word अनञ् means 'other than नञ्', and means words of the same class as नञ्, i. e. Indeclinables : and does not mean words which are not Indeclinables. The compounds like स्नात्वाकालक contained in the class of मयूरव्यंसक &c [[2.1.72]], do not take ल्यप anomalously. Or the word समासे is in the Locative with the force of specification : and means those compounds which are specifically formed with क्त्वा and not any compound in general.

Now by the rule [[1.1.72]], <i>ktva</i> would denote a form ending with <i>ktva</i>; and would include the case of a compound ending in <i>ktva</i>. But this general rule is modified by the maxim प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहित स्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम् "an affix denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added and ends with the affix itself." But the affix <i>ktva</i> is never ordained after a compound. Therefore, the case of compounds ending in <i>ktva</i>, would not be covered by the mere employment of <i>ktva</i>. Then comes the imaxim कृद्ग्रहणे गति कारक पूर्वस्यापि ग्रहणं 'a <i>krit</i> affix denotes whenever it is employed in grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that <i>krit</i> affix has been added and which ends with the <i>krit</i> affix, but moreover should a <i>gati</i>, or a noun such as denotes a case-relation have been prefixed to that word-form, then the <i>krit</i> affix must denote the same word-form together with the <i>gati</i> or the noun which may have been prefixed to it." By this a compound also may end in <i>ktva</i>. This maxim will cover cases like प्रकृत्य, पार्श्वतः कृत्य but not उच्चैः कृत्य &c because उच्चैः is neither a <i>gati</i> nor a <i>karaka</i>. Hence the employment of the word समासे in the <i>sutra</i>, and also of the word अनञ्पूर्वे, for नञ् is neither a <i>Gati</i> nor a <i>Karaka</i>.

In the case of प्रधाय and प्रस्थाय this maxim applies :-अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गो ल्यप् बाधते "a <i>Bahiranga</i> substitution of ल्यप् supersedes even <i>antaranga</i> rule". What are these <i>antaranga</i> rules superseded by the substitute ल्यप्? (1) हित्वं - the substitution of हि for धा [[7.4.42]]. Thus हित्वा but प्रधाय and not प्रहित्वा ॥ (2) दत्वं - the substitution of दद् for दो [[7.4.46]] — as दत्वा, but प्रदाय and not प्रदत्वा ॥ (3) आत्वं as required by [[6.4.42]]: as खात्वा, प्रखाय and प्रखन्य ॥ (4) इत्वं - as स्थित्वा but प्रस्थाय ॥ (5) ईत्वं by [[6.4.66]], as पीत्वा but प्रपाय ॥ (6) दीर्घत्वं by [[6.4.15]], as शान्त्वा but प्रशम्य ॥ (7) शुट् by [[6.4.19]], as पृष्ट्वा but आपृच्छ्य ॥ (8) ऊठ् — as द्यूत्वा ॥ (9) इट् [[7.2.56]] — देवित्वा but प्रदीव्य ॥
