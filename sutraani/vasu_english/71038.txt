In the छन्दस् (Vedas) the क्त्वा also, as well as ल्यप् is substituted for क्त्वा after an indeclinable compound, other than one preceded by the Negative नञ् ।
Thus कृष्णं वासो यजमानं परिधापयित्वा, प्रत्यञ्चर्मकं प्रत्यर्थयित्वा ॥ So also we have ल्यप्, as उद्धृत्य जुहोति ॥ The <i>sutra</i> could have been made shorter by saying merely वा छन्दसि; not doing so indicates that conditions and limitations are set aside in the Vedas in applying this affix. Therefore ल्यप् is applied even when there is no compound, as, अर्च्य तान् देवान् गतः ॥ The word छन्दसि governs the following <i>sutras</i> upto [[7.1.50]], inclusive.
