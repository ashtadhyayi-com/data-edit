The same augment अस् (असुक्) is added after the words 1. अश्व 2. क्षीर 3. वृष and 4. लवण before the Denominative affix क्यचि when the delight of the subject in these things is to be expressed.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of छन्दसि does not extend to this <i>sutra</i> or any further. Thus अश्वस्यति वडवा, क्षीरस्यति माणवकः, वृषस्यति गौः, लवणस्यत्युष्ट्रः ॥ अश्व + अस् + य + ति = अश्वस्यति [[6.1.97]]. Why 'when the delight of the subject is meant'? Observe अश्वीयति, क्षीरीयति, वृषीयति and लवणीयति ॥

Vart:- After अश्व and वृष, the force of the augment is that of desiring sexual connection.

Vart:- After क्षीर and लवण it has the force of ardently wishing for, i. e. an intense thirsting after the thing. The augment is not added, though the sense may be that of delight, if it has not the above meanings. Others say Vart:- असुक् should be added after every nominal stem when the sense is that of intense yearning after that thing: as दध्यस्यति, मध्वस्यति &c. Others say Vart:- That the augment सुक् should be added, as दधिस्यति, मधुस्यति &c.
