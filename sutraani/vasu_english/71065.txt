The augment नुम् is added to लभ् 'to get' preceded by आ before an affix beginning with य।
As आलम्भ्यो गौः ॥ The नुम् is added before the addition of the affix, and by so doing लभ् becomes लम्भ् and thus loses its character of having a penultimate अ, and therefore by [[3.1.124]], we shall have ण्यत् affix, and not यत् affix by [[3.1.98]]. Had the नुम् been added after the addition of the affix, then यत् would be added by [[3.1.98]]. Though in both cases the form will be आलम्भ्या, the difference will be in the accent: यत् would throw the acute on the first syllable (यतोऽनावः) while the word has <i>svarita</i> on the final; thus instead of आल꣡म्भ्या (by [[6.1.213]] and [[6.2.139]]), which यत् gives, we have आलम्भ्या॑ (तित् <i>svar</i>).

Why do we say 'when preceded by आ'? Observe लभ्य ॥ How do you explain अग्निष्टोम आलभ्यः ? All rules are optionally applied in the Vedas. Or आलभ्य may be explained by saying that the नुम् having been added, is again dropped.
