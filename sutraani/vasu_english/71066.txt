The augment नुम् is added to लभ् 'to get' preceded by उप before य when the reference is to something praise-worthy.
As उपलम्भ्या भवता विद्या, उपलम्भ्यानि धनानि ॥ These words are formed by ण्यत् and have <i>svarita</i> on the final. Why do we say 'when referring to something praise worthy'? Observe उपलभ्यमस्माद् वृषलात् किंचित्, this is formed with the यत् affix [[3.1.98]].
