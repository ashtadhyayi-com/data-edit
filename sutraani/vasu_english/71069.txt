The augment नुम् is optionally added to लभ् 'to get' not preceded by a Preposition before the चिण् Aorist and the Absolutive णमुल्।
Thus अलाभि or अलम्भि, लाभंलाभम् or लम्भंलम्भम् ॥ This is a <i>Vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, the option is allowed where there is no Preposition along with the root; and no option is allowed but नुम् must be added, when a Preposition precedes: as प्रालम्भि, प्रलम्भम् ॥
