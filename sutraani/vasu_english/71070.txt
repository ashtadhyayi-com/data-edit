Whatever has an indicatory उ , ऋ and ऌ (with the exception of a root) and the अङ्ग (stem) अच् (अञ्चि) get the augment नुम् in the strong cases.
Thus भवतु has an indicatory उ, formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affix डवतुप्, and it is declined as भवान्, भवन्तौ, भवन्तः ॥ Similarly ईयसुन् - श्रेयान्, श्रेयांसौ, श्रेयांसः, शतृ - पचन्, पचन्तौ, पचन्तः ॥ अञ्च - प्राङ्, प्राञ्चौ, प्राञ्चः ॥

Why do we say 'having an indicatory उक् vowel or the stem अच्'? Observe दृषत्, दृषदौ, दृषदः ॥

Why do we say in strong cases? Observe भवतः पश्य, श्रेयसः पश्य ॥ अञ्च् root is mentioned for the sake of <i>niyama</i>, i.e. of the roots, only अञ्च् gets नुम् and no other root. Therefore उखास्रत्, पर्णध्वत् formed from the roots स्रंसु and ध्वंसु having indicatory उ ॥ (See [[3.2.76]], [[4.1.6]], [[8.2.72]]). For the lengthening in भवान् &c, see [[6.4.10]], [[6.4.14]]: the च् is elided in प्राङ् by [[8.2.23]], and न् becomes ङ् by [[8.2.62]]: and त् in स्रत् by [[8.2.72]]. 

Why do we say 'with the exception of a root' when by the mere fact of including one root अच् all other roots would have been excluded from the scope of this <i>sutra</i>? The specific mention of अधातोः shows that the prohibition applies to original roots, and not to those roots which are derived from nouns. Thus गोमन्तमिच्छति = गोमत्यति formed by क्यच् ॥ Here गोमत्य is a derivative root, in its primitive state it was a noun. The prohibition of अधातोः will not apply to this root and नुम् will be added. Thus गोमत्य + क्विप् = गोमत्य् + ० (the अ is dropped by [[6.4.48]] = गोमत् + ० (the य् is elided by [[6.4.50]]). Now is added नुम् and we have गोमान् ॥
