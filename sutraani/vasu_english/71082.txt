अनडुह् gets the augment नुम् before the ending सु of the Nominative 1st-Case singular (and Vocative Case).
By [[7.1.98]] अनडुह् gets the augments आ after उ in the strong cases, and अ in Vocative Singular [[7.1.99]]. It thus becomes अनड्वाह् and अनड्वह्
॥ By the present <i>sutra</i> न् is added after this आ and आ ॥ The case-ending is elided by [[6.1.68]], and the final ह् by [[8.2.23]]. Thus we have अनड्वान् Nominative Singular; and अनड्वय् in the Vocative Singular. The augments आम् and अम् [[7.1.98]], [[7.1.99]], do not supersede नुम्, nor are they superseded by नुम् ॥

In this <i>sutra</i>, some read the <i>anuvritti</i> of आत् from [[7.1.80]]; and by so doing they add नुम् to that form of अनडुह् where there is an आ or अ, namely, after the word has taken the augment आम् in the nominative singular by [[7.1.98]], and अम् in the Vocative by [[7.1.99]]. Therefore, the नुम् does not debar आम् or अम्, nor is it debarred by आम् or अम् ॥ Others hold that though one is a general rule and the other is a particular rule, yet in this instance, आम् (or अम्) and नुम् are applied simultaneously, one not debarring the other, there is no relationship of बाध्य and बाधक among them, just as in चिचीषति the rule of lengthening [[6.4.16]] and reduplication are applied simultaneously, one not debarring the other. In बह्वनड्वाहि ब्राह्मणकुलानि, we add first आम् because it is subsequent, and them we add नुम् by [[7.1.72]] on the maxim of पुनः प्रसङ्गविज्ञान &c ॥
