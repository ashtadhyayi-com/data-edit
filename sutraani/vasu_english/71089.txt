असुङ् (अस्) is substituted for the final of पुंस् in the strong cases.
The word पुंस् is derived from पा (to protect) + डुम्सुन् (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 178), the म् being changed to <i>anusvara</i>. So when स् of पुंस् is replaced by अस् we get the form पुमस्, the उ of असुङ् indicates that न् should be added in the strong cases after अ [[7.1.70]], so we have पुमान्, पुमांसौ, पुमांसः ॥

This substitution must take place in its incipient stage before the affixes are added, (उपदेशिवद्भावः) : otherwise the accent will be wrong. The compounds have acute on the final, [[6.1.223]], therefore, परमपुंस् has acute on  पु. and in the Nominative Singular परमपुमान् the acute will remain on पु, but it is intended that it should be on मा, thus परमपुमान् ॥ The simple word पुमान् of course, has accent on पु ॥
