The word क्रोष्टु 'a jackal' is treated as if it ended in तृच् (तृ), in the feminine, before all case-endings.
This <i>sutra</i> is commenced for the sake of cases other than strong ones. In strong cases, whether of masculine or feminine, the former <i>sutra</i> applies; but in the feminine, in other cases also there is <i>trich</i>-treatment. Thus क्रोष्ट्री꣡, क्रोष्ट्री꣡भ्याम्, क्रोष्ट्रीभिः ॥ Some read the word क्रोष्टु in the <i>Gauradi</i> class [[4.1.41]], and they treat it is a तृच् ending word before the feminine affix ङीष्, as क्रोष्ट्रा ॥ According to them, in forming the <i>Taddhitartha</i> compounds like पञ्चभिः क्रोष्ट्रीभिः क्रीतैः = पञ्चक्रोष्टृभी रथैः, we could not get the form पञ्चक्रोष्टृभिः, because when the affix ठक् is elided by [[5.1.28]], the feminine is also elided by [[1.2.49]], and the ङीष् being thus <i>luk</i>-elided, there would be no तृज्वद्भाव, because the affix leaves no trace behind [[1.1.63]]. To get out of the difficulty, we can only say, that the form is so, in spite of the apparent inconsistency.

Those who do not read क्रोष्टु in the <i>Gauradi</i> class, they explain this <i>sutra</i> by saying that the word स्त्रियां indicates the sense, namely, क्रोष्टु is treated like a तृच् word, when it denotes a female, wherever it may occur.

And because क्रोष्टु is treated as if it was क्रोष्टृ, the feminine will be formed by the affix ङीप् by [[4.1.5]], and the form क्रोष्ट्री꣡ will be end-acute by [[6.1.174]]. So that whether क्रोष्ट्री be formed by ङीष् under <i>Gauradi</i> class, or by ङीप् under [[4.1.5]], the accent remains the same: while under this second view, we have not to face any such difficulty as in the first.
