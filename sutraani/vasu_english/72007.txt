Before the इट् beginning s-Aorist of the परस्मैपद the short अ of the root gets optionally वृद्धि when the अङ्ग (stem) begins with a consonant and the अ is prosodially short by being followed by a simple consonant.
Thus अकणीत् or अकाणीत्, अरणीत् or अराणीत् ॥ Why do we say 'of अ' ? Observe अदेवीत्, असेवीत् ॥ Besides this patent objection, there is another, not so manifest. If we had not taken अतः, the <i>sutra</i> would have ordained <i>Vriddhi</i> of every vowel (अचः [[7.2.3]]), the <i>Vriddhi</i> so ordained would be an अच् pertaining <i>Vriddhi</i>, and not an इक्-pertaining <i>Vriddhi</i>. Therefore ङित् affixes will not debar such <i>Vriddhi</i>, for the क्ङिति च [[1.1.5]], debars only इग्लक्षणा <i>Vriddhi</i>. Therefore कुटादि roots after which सिच् is ङित् [[1.2.1]], will get <i>Vriddhi</i>, which is not desired. Therefore we have only one form of न्यकुटीत्, न्यपुटीत् ॥

Why do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe मा भवानशीत्, मा भवानटीत् from अश् and अट् ॥ Why do we say 'prosodially short'? Observe अतक्षीत्, अरक्षीत् ॥

But why does not <i>vriddhi</i> take place in अचकासीत् from the root चकास् (Ad. 65) ? The <i>vriddhi</i> does not take place on the maxim येन ना व्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्; for the rule applies to short अ only when a consonant intervenes between it and the affix, and not when both consonants and vowels intervene. In चकास् not only the consonants क् and स् intervene but also the vowel आ ॥ Hence there is no <i>vriddhi</i>. Moreover, the व्यवधान can be by one letter and not by more than one letter. Therefore, applying this maxim, the word लंघाः might have been omitted from the <i>sutra</i> without any detriment. In that case, the form अतक्षीत् from the root तक्ष (<i>Bhu</i> 685) will be explained by saying that rule [[7.2.7]] does not apply to it, because two consonants intervene between अ and the affix. In this view of the case, the employment of the word लघोः in the <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of distinctness only.

The word इट् is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so that the rule applies to सेट् aorist. The rule therefore, does not apply to <i>Anit</i> aorist, as अपाक्षीत् ॥

The form अपिपठिषीत् the aorist of the Desiderative root, is explained by saying that the long आ of <i>vriddhi</i> is elided by [[6.4.64]].
