The participial affixes do not take the इट् augment after those roots, to which another suffix can optionally be added, with or without this augment इ।
That is, a root which is optionally Set, before other affixes, is invariably <i>anit</i> before <i>Nishtha</i>. Thus by [[7.2.44]], वल् consonant beginning affixes are optionally सेट् after the roots धू &c. The <i>Nishtha</i> after धू &c, will be invariably <i>anit</i>. Thus विधूतः, विधूतवान्; गूढः, गूढवान् ॥ By [[7.2.56]], the roots having an indicatory उ, optionally are followed by Set क्त्का ॥ The <i>Nishtha</i> after उदित् roots will invariably be <i>anit</i> : as वृद्धः, वृद्धवान् ॥

By the <i>vartika</i> तानि पदि दरिद्राणामुपसंख्यानम् the roots तन्, पत and दरिद्रा take optional इट् in the Desiderative [[7.2.49]]. Though पत् is a root which thus optionally takes इट् in the Desiderative , yet its <i>Nishtha</i> is always सेट्, for <i>Panini</i> himself has employed the word पतित in <i>Sutra</i> [[2.1.24]], [[2.2.38]]. According to <i>Padamanjari</i> this rule of यस्य विभाषा  is <i>anitya</i> and not of universal application. Because had this rule been of universal application then the root कृत which is optionally <i>anit</i> by [[7.2.57]], would universally <i>anit</i> by the present <i>sutra</i> : and there would be no necessity of reading it with a long ई in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, as कृती छेदने [[6.1.1]] to make its <i>nishtha</i> <i>anit</i> under [[7.2.14]].
