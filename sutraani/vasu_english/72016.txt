The participial affixes do not take the इट् augment after a root which has an indicatory आ।
As ञिमिदा — मिम्नः, मिन्नवान्; ञिक्ष्विदा — क्ष्विण्णः — क्ष्विण्णवान्; ञिष्विदा — स्विम्नः, स्विन्नवान् ॥ The च implies that other roots not enumerated are to be also included, as आश्वस्तः, वान्तः ॥

This and the <i>sutra</i> following it could have been made into one, as आदितश्च विभाषा भावादिकर्मणोः ॥ The separate making of two <i>sutras</i> indicates that the rule of यस्य विभाषा [[7.2.15]], applies with the restrictions and limitations of the rule ordaining 'option', i.e., the prohibition of इट् augment, with regard to the participial-affixes is limited by the same conditions, which apply to the optional employment of इट् before other affixes in the विभाषा rules (यदुपाधेर्विभाषा, तदुपाधेः प्रतिषेधः) ॥ Thus [[7.2.68]] ordains इट् optionally to the affix वसु after the roots गम्, हन्, विद् and विश् ॥ The root विद् there is the <i>Tudadi</i> root meaning 'to acquire'. The rule यस्य विभाषा will apply to this विद् with this meaning : and not to विद् meaning 'to know', the Past Participles of which are विदितः, विदितवान् ॥
