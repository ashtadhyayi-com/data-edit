The irregularly formed परिवृढ means 'Lord'.
This is formed, like दृढ, from वृह् or वृंह् ॥ When not having the sense of 'Lord', we have परिवृहितम् and परिवृंहितम् ॥

The ह is elided first as an anomaly. By so doing we can get the forms like परिव्रढयति, परिव्रढय्यगतः; पारिवृढीकन्या ॥ The form परिव्रढय्य is formed by ल्यप् instead of <i>ktva</i> ॥ Though the full noun is परिवृढ and णिच् is added to such a noun, yet for the purposes of <i>ktva</i> it is considered as a compound verb, having परि as <i>upasarga</i>. In fact, णिच् is added to वृढ, and the root becomes व्रढि, and then <i>ktva</i> is added to this root, and then there is compounding of परि with this word ending in <i>ktva</i>, and then by the regular process the <i>ktva</i> is replaced by ल्यप् ॥ The general rule is that Derivative roots formed from nouns, like परिवृढ, उत्मनस्, सुमनस् &c which have an <i>upasarga</i> as one of their formative elements, are treated as if they were compound verbs having those <i>upasargas</i>. The result of this is, that though the full noun is सुमनस्, yet in the derivative verb, सु will be treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, as in ordinary compound verbs. Thus the augment अ in the Imperfect is added after सु and not before it, as स्वमनायत, उदमनायत ॥ The rule is उपसर्गसमानाकारं पूर्वपदं धातुसंज्ञाप्रयोजके प्रत्यये चिकीर्षिते पृथक् क्रियते ॥ The Participial form of these words is therefore with ल्यप् and not क्त्वा, as सुमनाय्य and उन्मनाय्य ॥ The only exception to this rule is the noun संग्राम, in which the <i>upasarga</i> सम् is not considered as a separate member in the Derivative verb. This being the general rule, in परिव्रढयति the portion परि is treated as an <i>upasarga</i>, and व्रढयति as the verb, and its accent is governed by तिङ्ङ तिङ् [[8.1.28]] i. e. it becomes altogether unaccented and परि retains its accent. So also परिव्रढय्य, where is परि is compounded with the Participial form व्रढित्वा, and then त्वा is changed to ल्यप् by [[7.1.37]].
