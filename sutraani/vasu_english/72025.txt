The participial affix does not take the augment इट् after the root अर्द when it is preceded by अभि, when the meaning is that of 'near'.
As अभ्यर्णा सेना, अभ्यर्णा शरत् ॥ Why' when meaning near'? See अभ्यर्दितो वृषलः शीतेन meaning पीडितः ॥ विदूरं means 'remote,' that which is not remote is अविदूरं
'non-remote', the state of being non-remote is आविदूर्यम् 'non-remote-ness.' The affix यक् is added irregularly, in spite of the prohibition contained in [[5.1.121]].
