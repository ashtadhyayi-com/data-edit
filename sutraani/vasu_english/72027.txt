The following irregularly formed participles from the causative roots may optionally take इट् - 1. दान्त 2. शान्त 3. पूर्ण 4. दस्त 5. स्पष्ट 6. छन्न and 7. ज्ञप्त।
These words are formed either from the causative base or from the primary roots दम् &c. The other forms are दमितः, शमितः, पूरितः, दासितः, स्पाशितः, छादितः and ज्ञपितः ॥ The words दान्त &c. are formed by the <i>luk</i>-elision of णि (Causative), and not taking the इट् Augment. By [[7.2.49]] ज्ञप् optionally is सेट् and, therefore, by [[7.2.15]], its Participle would have been always अनिट्, hence, this <i>sutra</i> makes an option.
