The participial affix may optionally get इट् augment after हृष् when the word लोमन् or its synonym is in construction with it.
As हृष्टानि लोमानि or हृषितानि लोमानि; हृष्टाः केशाः or हृषिताः केशाः, हृष्टं or हृषितं लोमभिः or केशैः ॥ हृषु 'to lie' [[1.7.1]] is exhibited with an indicatory उ in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>, and would have been consequently always <i>anit</i>, in the <i>Nishtha</i> [[7.2.15]] because it was optionally <i>anit</i> before <i>ktva</i> [[7.2.56]] hence this rule. ह्रष् 'to be delighted' [[4.1.9]] is also included here, this verb is सेट् ॥ The option appertains to both these verbs. The word लोम means the hair of the body as well as of the head : as in the sentence लोमनखं स्पृष्ट्वा शौचं कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The sense of हृष् in connection with लोम or will be that of bristling up, horipillation. Why do we say "in connection with लोम?" Observe हृष्टो (<i>bhuadi</i>) देवदत्तः 'the deceived <i>Devadatta</i>' and ह्रषितो (<i>Divadi</i>) देवदत्तः 'the delighted <i>Devadatta</i>'.

Vart:- The option is allowed also in the senses of 'astonished' and 'beaten back', as ह्रष्टो or हृषितो देवदत्तः 'the astonished <i>Devadatta</i>'. हृष्टाः or हृषिता दन्ताः 'the bent or destroyed teeth'.
