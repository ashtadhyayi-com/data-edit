And after अपचित has also a second form with the augment इ ।
The word अपचित is formed with the preposition अप added to the root चाय् [[1.9.9]] 'to honor, to fear, to see' and चाय् changed irregularly to चि before क्त ॥ The other form is अपचायितः, as अपचितो or अपचायितोऽनेनगुरुः 'the teacher is feared by him'. This example is given when the sense is that of 'fear'; when the word means 'honor', then the participle must govern the genitive case, as required by [[3.2.188]].

Vart:- Before क्तिन् affix, चाय् is always changed to चि, as अपचितिः 'Loss, destruction, showing reverence'. The affix क्तिन् is added to चाय्, by considering it as belonging to the class of आप् &c. See [[3.3.94]] <i>Vartika</i>. Otherwise it would take the affix अ by [[3.3.103]].
