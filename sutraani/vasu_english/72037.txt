The augment इट् added to वलादि आर्धधातुक affixes, becomes lengthened, except in the personal endings of the लिट् (Perfect Tense), after the root ग्रह।
As ग्रहीता, ग्रहीतुम्, ग्रहीतव्यम् ॥ Why not in the Perfect? Observe जगृहिव, जगृहिम् ॥ The lengthening takes place of the इट् taught in [[7.2.35]], and does not refer to the चिण्वद् इट् of [[6.4.62]] : as ग्राहिता, ग्रहिष्यते ॥
