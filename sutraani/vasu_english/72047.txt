The augment इट् is added to the Participial affixes त and तवत् after कुष् when it is preceded by निर्।
As निष्कुषितवान्, निष्कुषितः ॥ The special mention of इट् in the <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of making its addition invariable, otherwise it would have been
optional, or debarred by [[7.2.15]]. In the subsequent <i>sutra</i>, the addition becomes again optional.
