The affix क्त्वा gets the इट् augment after जॄ and जॄव्रश्च्।
As जरित्वा or जरीत्वा, [[7.2.38]] and व्रश्चित्वा ॥ जॄ was prohibited by [[7.2.11]]. and व्रश्च would have been optionally सेट्, as it has an indicatory long ऊ, by [[7.2.44]]. Hence this rule. The special mention of <i>ktva</i>, stops the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>kta</i> and <i>ktavatu</i>.
