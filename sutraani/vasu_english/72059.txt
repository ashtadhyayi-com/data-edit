The परस्मैपद आर्धधातुक affixes beginning with स् do not get the इट् augment after वृत् and the three roots (वृध् , शृध् and स्यन्द्) that follow it.
Thus वृत् — वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत्, विवृत्सति । वृध् वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत् । विवृत्स्सति । शृधू । शर्त्स्यति । अशर्त्स्यत् । शिशृत्सति । स्यन्दू । स्यन्त्सति । अस्यन्त्स्यत् ।

The वृतादि roots are four वृत्, वृध्, शृध् and स्यन्द (<i>Bhuadi</i> 795-798). In the examples, the <i>Parasmaipada</i> forms are shown, because these roots are optionally <i>Parasmaipadi</i> by [[1.3.92]] before स्य and सन् ॥

Objection :- The word चतुर्भ्यः may conveniently have been omitted from the <i>sutra</i>. A reference to the <i>Dhatupatha</i> will show that the वृतादि roots form a subdivision of द्युतादि roots, and stand at the end of <i>Dyutadi</i> class. So that the <i>sutra</i> न वृद्भ्यः would have been enough, and there would have been no uncertainty or vagueness about it, for the word वृतादि would mean 'the roots वृत् &c. with which the <i>Dyutadi</i> class ends'. Thus we shall get the five roots 795 वृतुर्वर्तने 796 वृधु वृद्धौ, 797 शृधु शब्दकुत्सायाम्; 798 स्यन्दू प्रस्रवणे and कृपू सामर्थ्ये ॥ As regards the last root कृपू, we shall find from the next <i>sutra</i>, that the present <i>sutra</i> applies to this root also. Or we can change the order of the roots, putting  कृपू first, and वृतु &c after it, so that वृतादि will mean four roots only. Whether <i>vritadi</i> be taken to mean the five or the four roots, the word चतुर्भ्यः is redundant.

Ans:- The word चतुर्भ्यः is used in order that the prohibition contained in this <i>sutra</i> may debar the 'option' which the root स्यन्दू would have taken, because of its indicatory long ऊ [[7.2.44]]. For this 'option' is an <i>antaranga</i> operation, because it applies to all <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes; while the 'prohibition' of the present <i>sutra</i> is a <i>bahiranga</i>, because it applies to those affixes only which begin with स ॥ So that the 'prohibition' of this <i>sutra</i> would not have debarred the 'option' of [[7.2.44]]: and in the <i>Parasmaipada</i> स्यन्दू would have had two forms; which, however, is not the case because of the word चतुर्भ्यः by which the 'prohibition' is extended to स्यन्दू also. Thus in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, we have only one form, as, स्यन्त्स्यति; but in the <i>Atmanepada</i> we have two forms स्यन्दिष्यते or स्यन्त्स्यते ॥

The word '<i>Parasmaipada</i>' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so that the prohibition does not apply to <i>atmanepada</i> affixes: as वर्त्तिषीष्ट, वर्तिष्यते, अवर्तिष्यत्, विवर्तिष्यते, स्यन्दिषीष्ट or स्यन्त्सीष्ट ॥ Moreover, with regard to <i>Atmanepada</i> also, the इट् is added to these roots when they stand in the same '<i>pada</i>' with the affixes. But when the <i>Atmanepada</i> affixes are added not to the roots '<i>vrit</i> &c', but to the roots which are derived from the nominal bases formed from '<i>vrit</i> &c', then the 'root' is not in the same <i>pada</i> with the affix, and the prohibition of this <i>sutra</i> will apply. As विवृत्सित्रीयते ॥ Moreover, the rule applies, as we have said, to the affixes standing in the same '<i>pada</i>' with the 'roots'; therefore it will apply to Desiderative roots, as विवृत्सति, though शप् here intervenes between the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix सन् and the <i>Parasmaipada</i> तिप्; so also, an <i>ekadesa</i> though <i>sthanivat</i> and therefore an intervention, will not be considered so for the purposes of this rule, as विवृत्सिष्यति; so also in विवृत्सयति ॥ This prohibition, moreover, applies to कृत् affixes, and where there is <i>luk</i>-elision of <i>Parasmaipada</i> affixes. As विवृत्सिता; and विवृत्स त्वम् where the Imperative हि is <i>luk</i> elided, and being so elided, the force of <i>Parasmaipada</i> does not here remain by न लुमताङ्गस्य [[1.1.63]]; hence the above <i>Ishti</i>.
