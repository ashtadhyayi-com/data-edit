The परस्मैपद आर्धधातुक affixes beginning with स् and the affix तास् (the sign of the Periphrastic Future) do not get the इट् augment after the root कॢप्।
Thus कल्प्ता, कल्प्स्यति, अकल्प्स्यत्, चिक्लृप्स्यति ॥ But कल्पितासे, कल्पिषीष्ट, कल्पिष्यते, अकल्पिष्यत, चिकल्पिषते in the <i>Atmanepada</i>.

In the case of क्लृप् also, the इट् is added to the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes in the <i>Atmanepada</i>, when the root stands in the same <i>pada</i> with the affixes and there is prohibition everywhere else. So also there is prohibition before <i>krit</i>-affixes, and the <i>luk</i>-elision of <i>Parasmaipada</i>. As चिक्लृप्सिता, चिक्लृप्स त्वं ॥

According to <i>Padamanjari</i>, these two <i>sutras</i> could have been shortened thụs:- (1) न वृद्भ्यः पञ्चभ्यः, (2) तासि च; and "क्लृपः" could well have been omitted. The तास् comes only after क्लृप and not after other roots of <i>Vritadi</i> class, in <i>Parasmaipada</i> (l. 3.92) and (l. 3.93). Therefore, there is no fear that the prohibition तासि च will apply to the other roots of <i>vritadi</i>, but only to '<i>klip</i>', because the word परस्मैपदिषु is understood here; and as no roots of <i>vritadi</i> class take <i>Parasmaipada</i> in the Periphrastic Future except '<i>klip</i>', there is no fear of any ambiguity.
