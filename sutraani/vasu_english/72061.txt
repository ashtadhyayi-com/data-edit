After a root which ends in a vowel and after the Periphrastic Future affix तासि is always devoid of the इट् augment (after such a root) थल् the personal ending of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) तास्, does not also get the augment इट् ।
Those vowel-ending roots in <i>Dhatupatha</i> which are invariably <i>anit</i> before the affix तास् (Periphrastic Future), are also <i>anit</i> before the Perfect ending थल् ॥ As याता (Periphrastic Future), ययाथ (Periphrastic), चेता, चिचेथ, नेता, निनेथ; होता जुहोथ ॥ Why 'ending in a vowel'? Observe भत्ता, बिभेदिथ ॥ Why 'like तास्'? Observe लूत्वा but लुलविथ, Why 'थल'? Observe याता but ययिव, ययिम ॥ The word नित्यं qualifies अनिट्, if therefore तास् be optionally <i>anit</i>, then the थल् will be सेट् always. As तास् — विधोता or विधविता; the थल् is विदुधविथ ॥

Here इट् is optional before तास् by [[7.2.44]]. Similarly चक्रमिथ, for क्रम् is <i>anit</i> in <i>atmanepada</i>, and सेट् in <i>Parasmaipada</i>. In fact, whereever there is want of इट्, whether by complete prohibition or optional prohibition, all that is regulated by [[7.2.13]]: this is the view adopted by the <i>Kasika</i>. But another view is that the prohibition of this <i>sutra</i> applies to the इट् of [[7.2.13]] only, but does not debar the option of [[7.2.44]]; so they have two forms विदुधोथ and विदुधविथ ॥ This view is applied by them to [[7.2.46]], as सस्वर्थ or सस्वरिथ [[7.2.44]].

Why have we used the word वत् in तास्वत् ? The force of वत् is that the root should have a form in तास् and then be <i>anit</i>; and if a root has no Periphrastic Future form, and thus its तास् is <i>anit</i>, such a root is not governed by this <i>sutra</i>. As जघसिथ and उवयिथ ॥ Here the roots घस् and वय् the substitutes अद् and वेञ् respectively have no Periphrastic Future form, and hence this rule does not apply to them.
