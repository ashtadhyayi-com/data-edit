In the opinion of भारद्वाज , it is only after a root which ends in short ऋ and after which the Periphrastic Future तास् is always devoid of the augment इट् , थल् the personal-ending of the लिट् (Perfect Tense), like तास् does not get the augment इट् ।
As स्मर्त्ता, सस्मर्थ, ध्वर्त्ता, दध्वर्थ ॥ The ऋ roots are covered by [[7.2.61]]; the specification of these roots makes a restriction, so that all other roots, are not <i>anit</i>, though the Periphrastic Future in तास् be <i>anit</i>. So that according to <i>Bharadwaja</i>, we have forms like ययिथ, वयिथ, पेचिथ, शेकिथ ॥ Thus this <i>sutra</i> makes the preceding two <i>sutras</i> optional, except so far as short ऋ-ending roots are concerned.

As a general rule, all roots ending in long ॠ are सेट्; therefore, the <i>sutra</i> mentions short ऋ, in order to debar its application to long ॠ ending words. Had it not been so, this rule would have been a <i>vidhi</i> rule and not a <i>niyama</i>: because rule [[7.2.61]] does not apply to long ॠ ending roots, and so if the present <i>sutra</i> were to include long ॠ also, it could not be called a <i>niyama</i> (restriction) of [[7.2.61]].
