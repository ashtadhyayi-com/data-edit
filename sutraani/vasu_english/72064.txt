In the छन्दस् (Vedas) are found the irregular forms 1. बभूथ 2. आततन्थ 3. जगृम्भ 4. and 5. ववर्थ।
As त्वं हि होता प्रथमो बभूथ (= बभूविथ); येनान्तरिक्षभुर्वाततन्थ (= आतेनिथ), जगृम्भा ते दक्षिणमिन्द्र हस्तम् (= जगृहिम), ववर्थ त्वं हि ज्योतिषा (= ववरिथ). See [[7.2.13]]. This is also a <i>niyama</i> rule with regard to वृ for by [[7.2.13]] the root वृ was already <i>anit</i>, and its Perfect would have been ववर्थ by that rule. The special mention of this form shows that in secular literature this root is always सेट् before थ of the Perfect.
