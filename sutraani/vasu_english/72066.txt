थल् the personal-ending of the लिट् (Perfect Tense) gets the augment इट् after 1. अद् 2. ॠ and 3. व्यय्।
As आदिथ, आरिथ and संविव्ययिथ ॥ The root व्येञ् is not changed to व्या [[6.1.46]] in the Perfect. By [[7.2.63]], the roots अद् and व्य would have optionally been सेट्, and ऋ never, therefore, the present <i>sutra</i> makes the इट् augment compulsory. The इट् is repeated in the aphorism for the sake of clearness, the rule could have stood without it, for the <i>anuvritti</i> of 'optionally' could not have run into it from the last <i>sutra</i>: for if it was an optional <i>sutra</i>, the enumeration of अद् and व्य was useless, as they were already provided for by [[7.2.63]]. Therefore, this <i>sutra</i> makes an invariable rule.
