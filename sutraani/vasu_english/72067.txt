The Participial affix वस् gets the augment इट् only then the reduplicated root before it consists of one syllable or when it comes after a root ending in long आ and after घस्।
Thus आदिवान्, ओशिवान्, पेचिवान्, शेकिवान् ॥ In the first two of these, the reduplicate stems आद् and आश् become of one syllable by the coalescence of अ अद् and अअश् ॥ In पेच् and शेक् the reduplicate is elided and the vowel अ changed to ए, and thus the reduplicate has become of one syllable. Of roots ending in आ we have, ययिवान्, तस्थिवान्, of घस्-जक्षिवान् ॥ This वस् would have taken the augment by the general rule of इट् increment, the present <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>niyama</i>, so that the roots which are not monosyllabic in their reduplicate form are <i>anit</i>: as बिभिद्वान्, चिच्छिद्वान्, बभूवान्, शिश्रिवान् ॥ The <i>niyama</i> is made with regard to the roots which would have taken इट् generally, as not being governed by the prohibition in [[7.2.13]]. The roots ending in long आ may consist of more than one syllable in their reduplicate form, as याया + वस्, hence their separate enumeration: as a matter of fact, however, these reduplicates also become monosyllabic ultimately by losing their आ ॥ The root दरिद्रा is not governed by this rule, for its Perfect will be formed periphrastically by [[3.1.35]] <i>Vartika</i>, because it consists of more than one syllable: as दरिद्रांचकार ॥ And when आम् is not added, there also दरिद्रा loses its final आ before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes by the <i>vartika</i> under [[6.4.114]]. So the आ being elided before the adding of any affix, this becomes a root which no longer ends in आ, and so the cause of adding इट् under this <i>sutra</i> no longer exists, and so no इट् is added. Thus we have ददरिद्वान्, for before <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes दरिद्रा loses its आ ([[6.4.114]] <i>Vartika</i>), and this elision being considered as <i>siddha</i>, ([[6.4.114]] <i>Vartika</i>), no occasion remains for the augment इट् ॥ The घस् becomes जक्ष् in its reduplicate form (a stem of one syllable), but had it not been separately mentioned, then by [[6.4.100]], the penultimate अ of घस् would have been elided first, before reduplication, because [[6.4.100]], is subsequent in order to the rule ordaining reduplication. ([[6.1.14]] &c). The अ being elided, we should have घ्स् only, which not having any vowel, could not be reduplicated. By its separate enumeration here, the augment इट् being ordained by a subsequent rule [[7.2.67]], prevents even the rule of elision [[6.4.100]]. Having, therefore, first added इट्, we then elide the penultimate अ by [[6.4.98]], this elided अ, however, becomes <i>sthanivat</i> for the purposes of reduplication only by [[1.1.52]]. Thus घस् + इवस् = घ्स् + इवस् [[6.4.98]] = जक्ष् + इवस् = जक्षिवान् ॥
