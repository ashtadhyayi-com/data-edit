The Desiderative सन् gets the augment इट् after the roots 1. स्मिङ् 2. पूङ् 3. ऋ 4. अञ्जू and 5. अशू।
Thus सिस्मयिषते, पिपविषते [[7.4.80]] अरिरिषति, अञ्जिजिषति [[6.1.2]] and [[6.1.3]] and अशिशिषते ॥ The root पूञ् is not governed by this rule, as पुपूषति ॥ The अश् (V. 18). of <i>Suadi</i> class is taken here, and not अश् (IX. 51) of <i>Kryadi</i> class, for the latter always has इट्, while the former having an indicatory long ऊ has optionally इट् ॥
