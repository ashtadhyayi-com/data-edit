आ is substituted for the final of अष्टन् before a case-ending.
Thus अष्टाभिः, अष्टाभ्यः, अष्टानाम्, अष्टासु ॥ Why 'before a case-ending'? Observe अष्टत्वम्, अष्टता ॥ The rule of this <i>sutra</i> is an optional one, and we have in the alternative अष्टभिः, अष्टभ्यः ॥ The आ in the <i>sutra</i> indicates the individual letter आ, and not आ belonging to the general class आ ॥ For the generic आ would include the nasalised आं also, and as the letter replaced (अन्) is a nasal, the substitute would have been also nasal आँ, but it is not so. See [[6.1.172]] and [[7.1.22]]. This rule applies also when the word stands at the end of a compound, as प्रियाष्टानः or प्रियाष्टौः [[7.1.22]]. The word विभक्ति governs the subsequent <i>sutras</i> upto [[7.2.114]].
