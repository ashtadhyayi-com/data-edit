आ is substituted for the final of युष्मद् and अस्मद् before the case-ending of the Accusative -2nd case.
As त्वाम्, माम्, युवाम्, आवाम्, युष्मान् and अस्मान् ॥ This rule applies to endings which are even substitutes, otherwise the last rule would have been sufficient. See [[7.2.28]], [[7.2.29]], and [[7.2.92]] and [[7.2.97]].
