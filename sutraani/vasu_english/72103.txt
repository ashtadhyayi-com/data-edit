क is substituted for किम् before a विभक्ति affix.
As कः, कौ, के ॥ The substitution takes place even when the augment अकच् is added. Therefore, the substitute is here क and not अ which latter would have been sufficient for किम् ॥ For म् of किम् being replaced by अ [[7.2.102]], the इ would be left, which would be replaced by अ, had the <i>sutra</i> been किमोऽत् and the forms would have been the same (क् + अ + अ = क [[6.1.97]]. See [[5.3.1]], [[5.3.13]] &c.
