कु is substituted for किम् before the विभक्ति अत् ।
As क्व गमिष्यसि, क्व भोक्ष्यते ॥ The substitute कु of the last rule, before the affix अ would have become क्व, but that it would have caused <i>guna</i>, hence this separate substitute. Had the <i>sutra</i> been किमोऽड्वत् it would not have included the अकच् augmented किम् ॥
