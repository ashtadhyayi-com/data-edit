अन is substituted for the इद् of इदम् in the Instrumental -3rd case singular and the cases that follow, provided that the augment अकच् is not added.
As अनेन, अनयोः ॥ Why do we say "not when क is added by [[5.3.71]]"?
Observe इमकेन, इमकयोः ॥ The word आप् (आपि) in the <i>sutra</i> is a <i>pratyahara</i>, formed with the आ of टा (Instrumental Singular), and प् of सुप् (Locative Plural).
