The इद् of इदम् is elided before a विभक्ति affix beginning with a consonant.
As आभ्याम्, एभिः, [[7.1.11]] एभ्यः एषाम्, एषु ॥ For म् is substituted अ by [[7.2.102]], and for अ + अ = अ by [[6.1.97]]. The rule: [[1.1.52]] by which a substitute replaces only the final letter, does not apply here, on the maxim मानर्थके अलोऽन्त्यविधिः ॥ For no purpose is served by eliding merely the final म् of इदम् ॥ Hence इद् is elided. Or it may be said that the <i>sutra</i> does not teach the elision of इद्, but of अन् which was substituted for इद् by the preceding <i>sutra</i>.
