The वृद्धि (आर्) is substituted for the root vowel (ऋ) of the अङ्ग (stem) मृज् before an affix.
As मार्ष्टा, मार्ष्टुम्, मार्ष्टव्यम् ॥ The मृज् here is a root, and the affixes before which this <i>Vriddhi</i> takes place are those which come after roots, and not which come after <i>Pratipadikas</i>. Therefore, not before the affixes भ्यां &c, as कंसपरिमृड्भ्याम्, मृड्भिः ॥ The <i>anuvritti</i> of the word <i>vibhakti</i> has ceased. This <i>sutra</i> debars <i>guna</i> of [[7.3.84]].
