ऐ is placed before the य् of न्यग्रोध instead of वृद्धि when the word stands alone and is not a member of a compound and is followed by a तद्धित affix with the indicatory ञ् , ण् or क् ।
As नैयग्रोधश्चमसः (= न्यग्रोधस्य विकारः). Why do we say 'when it is alone'? Observe न्यग्रोधमूले भवाः शालयः = न्यग्रोधमूलाः ॥ न्यग्रोध is a derivative word (from न्यग्रोहयति = नीचैर्गतौ परोहैर्वधते), then it would have been governed by [[7.3.3]], this separate, <i>sutra</i> is then for the sake of making a restrictive rule (<i>niyama</i>) with regard to this word. If it is a primary word, then this <i>sutra</i> makes a <i>Vidhi</i> rule. The word केवल is a <i>jnapaka</i> that the rule of <i>Tadadi</i> applies in this section. See [[7.3.8]], also.
