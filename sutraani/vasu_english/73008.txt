A compound beginning with श्वन् and followed by the तद्धित affix इञ् is not governed by the prohibition nor takes the augment taught in द्वारादीनां च [[7.3.4]].
Thus the descendant of श्वभस्त्र is श्वाभस्त्रिः, so also श्वादंष्ट्रिः ॥ The word श्वन् is included in the list of <i>Dvaradi</i> words [[7.3.4]]., the present <i>sutra</i> implies that the rule [[7.3.4]] applies not only to those words, but to compounds beginning with those words.

Vart:- This rule applies when any <i>Taddhita</i> affix beginning with इ follows; as श्वगणेन चरति =  श्वागणिकः, श्वायूथिकः [[4.4.11]].

The prohibition applies, when other <i>Taddhita</i> affixes follow such a word ending with इञ् (an affix beginning with इ) : as from श्वाभस्त्रि we have श्वाभस्त्रम् (श्वाभस्त्रेरिदं) ॥
