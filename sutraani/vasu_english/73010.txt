Up to यथातथयथापुरयोः पर्यायेण [[7.3.31]] inclusive, the substitution of वृद्धि will take place for the first vowel of the second member in a compound.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>, and exerts governing influence upto [[7.3.32]] exclusive. The phrase "of the second member of the compound" should be supplied in all those <i>sutras</i>, to complete the sense. Thus in [[7.3.11]], the word उत्तरपदस्य should be supplied. As पूर्ववार्षिकं, अपरवार्षिकम्, पूर्वहैमनम्, अपरहैमनम् ॥

In those <i>sutras</i>, where the word denoting the first member is not exhibited in the Ablative case, as in [[7.3.18]], [[7.3.19]], [[7.3.20]], [[7.3.21]], the present <i>sutra</i> is absolutely necessary for causing the <i>vriddhi</i> of the second member. But in those <i>sutras</i>, where the first member is exhibited in the ablative case, as in [[7.3.11]] (अवयवात्), there this <i>sutra</i> is only explanatory (and not absolutely necessary), and serves also the purpose of placing such <i>vriddhis</i> under the category of '<i>uttarapada</i>-<i>vriddhi</i>'. This peculiar <i>vriddhi</i> is liable to certain rules of accent, as in [[6.2.105]]. Hence the importance of the present aphorism in those <i>sutras</i> also, where the word is exhibited in the fifth case.
