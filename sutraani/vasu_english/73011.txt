Before a तद्धित affix having an indicatory ञ् , ण् or क् वृद्धि is substituted for the first vowel of a word denoting season when it is preceded by a word denoting a part.
As पूर्ववार्षिकम्, पूर्वहैमनम्, अपरवार्षिकम्, अपरहैमनम् ॥ The composition with पूर्व and अपर &c takes place by [[2.2.1]]. and then by [[4.3.18]] there is ठक् after वर्ष, and अण् after हेमन्त with the elision of त by [[4.3.22]]. The <i>Tadanta</i>-<i>viddhi</i>, as a general rule, does not apply to compounds, so that a rule made applicable to a particular word, will not apply to a compound which ends with that word: but <i>tadanta</i>-<i>viddhi</i> applies to a word denoting season when it takes an affix causing <i>Vriddhi</i>, and is preceded by a word denoting a portion. We draw this rule from the present <i>sutra</i>, for हैमनं being formed from हेमन्त by a <i>vriddhi</i>-causing affix [[4.3.22]], the affix अण् will be applied to हेमन्त even when it is the second member of a compound, the first member of which denotes a part. (ऋतोर्वृद्धिमद्विधाववयवात् ( I.1.72) <i>Vartika</i> <i>Mahabhashya</i>).

Why do we say 'denoting a portion'? Observe पूर्वासु वर्षासु भवं पौर्ववर्षिकम् with ठञ् [[4.3.11]]. The <i>tadanta</i>-<i>vidhi</i> applies only when the first member denotes a portion.
