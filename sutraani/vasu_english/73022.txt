But the वृद्धि of the first vowel of इन्द्र when it stands as the second member of a द्वन्द समास , does not take place before a तद्धित affix having an indicatory ञ् , ण् or क् ।
As सौमेन्द्रः, आग्नेन्द्रः ॥ Why "when it stands as the subsequent member"? Observe ऐन्द्राग्न मेकादशकपालं चरुं निर्वपेत् ॥ There are two vowels in the word इन्द्र, and when a <i>Taddhita</i> affix is added, then one of these i. e. the अ or the last vowel is elided by [[6.4.148]], and the other (i. e. the इ, coalesces with the last vowel of the first term, as सोम + इन्द्र + अण् = सोम + इन्द्र् + अ = सोमे + न्द्र् + अ ॥ Now, no vowel is left of इन्द्र when it gets the form न्द्र्, so what is the necessity of the present prohibitory rule? This prohibition indicates the existence of the following maxim : बहिरङ्गमपि पूर्वोत्तरपदयोः पूर्वं कार्यं भवति, पश्चादेकादेशः or in other words पूर्वोत्तरनिमित्तकार्यात् पूर्वमन्तरङ्गोऽप्येकादेशो न ॥ "The substitution of one vowel for the final of the first and the initial of the second member of a compound does, even when it is <i>antaranga</i>, not take place previously to an operation which concerns the first or the second member of the compound". It is on this maxim that the forms पूर्वशुकामशम [[7.3.14]] &c are constructed, otherwise उ being the first vowel of the second member (इ of इषु having merged in पूर्व), would have been <i>vriddhied</i>.
