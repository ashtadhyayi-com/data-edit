Before a तद्धित affix having an indicatory ञ् , ण् or क् the वृद्धि is substituted for the first vowels of both members of the compound which is the name of a city of the Eastern people and which ends in the word नगर।
As सोह्मनागरः (= सुह्मनगरे भवः), पौण्ड्रनागरः ॥ Why do we say 'of the Eastern people'? Observe माद्रनगरः, from मद्रनगरः the city of the Northern people.
