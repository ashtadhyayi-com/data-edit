Even so from a new derivative from this stem ending in ढ, formed with a तद्धित affix having an indicatory ञ् , ण् or क् there is वृद्धि substitution for the first vowel of the second member and optionally for the first vowel of the first member in प्रवाहणेय and प्रावाहणेय।
As प्रवाहणेयस्यापत्यं = प्रावाहणेयिः or प्रवाहणेयिः, प्रा or प्र-वाहणेयकम् ॥
