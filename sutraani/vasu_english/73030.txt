Before a तद्धित affix having an indicatory ञ् , ण् or क् , the वृद्धि is always substituted for the first vowel of 1. शुचि 2. ईश्वर 3. क्षेत्रज्ञ 4. कुशल and 4. निपुण when preceded by the Negative particle, but this substitution is optional for the vowel of the Negative particles.
As अशौचम् or आशौचम्, अनैश्वर्यम् or आनैश्वर्यम्, अक्षैत्रज्ञ्यम् or आक्षैत्रज्ञ्यम्, अकौशलम् or आकौशलम्, अनैपुणम् or आनैपुणम् ॥ Some say the optional <i>vriddhi</i> of the negative particle is an <i>aprapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, no other rule would have caused its <i>vriddhi</i> had this rule not existed. They argue that by [[5.1.121]], all affixes denoting भाव are prohibited after a <i>Tatpurusha</i> compound with the negative particle; therefore, the words शुचि &c, should be first developed by the addition of भाव-affixes, and then they should be compounded with the negative particle, which may be optionally <i>vriddhied</i> by this rule, which would apply to it, though it is not an <i>anga</i>, because the rule teaches <i>vriddhi</i>. Others controvert this opinion, and hold that other affixes causing <i>vriddhi</i> than भाव-affixes, also come after negative-<i>Tatpurusha</i> compounds, such as affixes denoting descendant &c: and भाव-affixes are added to <i>Bahuvrihi</i> negative compounds also, therefore, the force of the <i>anuvritti</i> of अङ्ग, which is understood up to the end of the Seventh <i>Adhyaya</i> [[6.1.1]], and a fortiori in this <i>sutra</i> also, should not be set aside as the above interpretation would do. Moreover the full <i>Taddhita</i> compounds अक्षेत्रज्ञ and अनीश्वर are read in the list of <i>Brahmanadi</i> words [[5.1.124]], and as such they take the भाव affix ष्यञ् which would have always caused the <i>vriddhi</i> of अ, but for this <i>sutra</i> which makes it optional. Therefore it is a <i>prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>.
