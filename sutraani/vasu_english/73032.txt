त् is substituted for the न् of the root हन् 'to kill' before an affix with a indicatory ञ् or ण् which also causes वृद्धि of the penultimate अ , but the augment is not added before the Aorist sign nor before the Personal ending णल् of the लिट् (Perfect Tense).
The <i>anuvritti</i> of '<i>Taddhita</i>' ceases, and with it that of कित् also which causes <i>Vriddhi</i> in <i>Taddhita</i> only. The णित् and ञित् do govern still. Thus घातः (with घञ्), घातयति (with णिच्), घातकः (with ण्वुल्), साधुघातिन् with इञ्; घातंघातम् with णमुल् ॥ But जघामि and जघान with चिण् and णल् ॥ This <i>sutra</i> has reference to roots, and refers to those affixes only which come after roots (धातुप्रत्यय), therefore not here वार्त्रघ्नः from वृत्रहन् ॥
