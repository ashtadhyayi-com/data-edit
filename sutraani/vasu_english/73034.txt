The वृद्धि is not substituted before the Aorist sign चिण् or a कृत् affix with an indicatory ञ् or ण् for the vowel of that root which ends in म and is acutely accented (उदात्त) in its original enunciation (धातुपाठ), but not so in चम् after आ।
The <i>vriddhi</i> of the penultimate अ takes place before णित्  and ञित् affixes [[7.2.116]], that <i>vriddhi</i> does not take place in the case of <i>udatta</i> roots ending in म् ॥ Thus अशमि, अतमि, and अदमि in चिण् ॥ Compare [[6.4.92]], [[6.4.93]]. Similarly with कृत् affixes, as शमकः, तमकः, दमकः, शमः, तमः, दमः ॥ Why do we say 'acutely accented'? Observe यामकः, रामकः ॥ How do you explain उद्यम and उपरम? These are irregular forms exhibited by <i>Panini</i> himself in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> अडउद्यमे (<i>Bhuadi</i> 380), यम उपरमे (<i>Bhuadi</i> 1033) Why do we use "in the original enunciation or <i>upadesa</i>"? So that the rule may apply to शमी, दमी, तमी, but not to याममः, रामकः ॥ Here to the root शम्, तम् and दम् is added the affix घिनुण् [[3.2.141]]. The words शमिन्꣡ &c. get the affix-accent, namely acute इ꣡; and thus the root-vowel becomes <i>anudatta</i>. Though the root now becomes <i>anudatta</i>, yet because in its <i>upadesa</i> it was <i>udatta</i>, the present <i>sutra</i> will apply and prevent <i>vriddhi</i>. The roots यम्, रम् are <i>anudatta</i> in <i>upadesa</i>, but in यामकः, रामकः they become <i>udatta</i> by लित् accent. This accent is a secondary accent and not the 'original' accent; and hence the present rule does not apply and there is <i>vriddhi</i>. Why do we say ending in म्? Observe चारकः पाठकः ॥ Why with the exception of आचम्? Observe आचामकः ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the roots आ-चम्, कम् and वम्, as वामः, कामः and आचामः ॥ In the case of कस्, the affix घञ् is added in that alternative, when the root does not take the affix णिङ् [[3.1.31]]. It thus gets <i>vriddhi</i>.

The word आमः is formed from the <i>Churadi</i> अम्, which with the affix णिच् gets <i>Vriddhi</i>, because णिच् is not a <i>krit</i>-affix, and is not therefore governed by this rule. If you say "let there be <i>vriddhi</i> of णिच्, but this <i>vriddhi</i> will be shortened by [[6.4.92]] because it is a मित् root", we reply "this root is not मित्" ॥ The मित् roots are those enumerated in <i>Bhuadi</i> class, subdivision घटादिः (800). No doubt, there it is said that the roots ending in अम् are मित् (in अमन्ताश्च). But a root is regarded मित् only with regard to the Causative णिच् affix, and not with regard to that णिच् of the <i>Churadi</i> class where the sense of the causative is not involved in it. Therefore this root is not मित् [[6.4.93]].

The phrases सूर्यविश्रामा भूमिः and others like it are incorrect. Why do we say 'चिण् and <i>krit</i> only'? Observe शशाम, ददाम, चचाम ॥
