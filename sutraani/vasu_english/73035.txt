The वृद्धि is not substituted for the vowels of जन् 'to produce' and वधे before the Aorist sign चिण् and the कृत् affixes with an indicatory ञ् or ण् ।
As अजनि and अवधि with चिण्, and जनकः and वधकः (with ण्वुल्), प्रजनः, वधः ॥ This rule refers to the separate and the distinct root वध and not to the substitute of हन् ॥ This we see in the line भक्षकश्चेन्न विद्यते वधकोऽपि न विद्यते ॥ The form from हन् will be घातकः ॥ Moreover the substitute वध ends with अ i.e. it is of two syllables '<i>badha</i>', and as such it also does not admit <i>Vriddhi</i>. (See [[2.4.42]]). The prohibition refers to चिण् and <i>krit</i>-affixes, therefore not here, as जजान गर्भं महिमानमिन्द्रम् ॥
