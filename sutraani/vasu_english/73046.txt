According to the opinion of Northern Grammarians इ is not substituted for that अ which is obtained by shortening the long आ of the feminine (under sūtra केऽणः [[7.4.13]] before the affix क) which is preceded by य् or a क्।
The mention of 'northern grammarians' makes this an optional rule. As इभ्यका or इभ्यिका, क्षत्रियका or क्षत्रियिका, चटकका or चटकिका, मूषिकका, मूषिकिका ॥ Why do we say preceded by य् or क् ? Observe अश्वक-अश्विका only (from अश्वा) ॥ The word यकपूर्वायाः is exhibited in the feminine, in order to indicate that the rule applies when the feminine affix आ is shortened to अ ॥ Therefore not here शुभंयिका from शुभंया (शुभं याति). So also भद्रंयिका from भद्रया, where आ is part of the root या (see [[3.2.74]]).

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated of the य् and क् being finals of a root. When the य् or क् preceding this अ, is the final of the root, the prohibition contained in the <i>sutra</i>, does not apply: as सुनयिका, सुशयिका, and अशोकिका ॥

Why do we say 'of long आ'? Observe सांकाश्ये भवा = सांकाश्यिका ॥ The word संकाश्य is formed from संकाश by the affix ण्य (संकाशे निर्वृत्तं) ॥ Then is added the affix वुञ् [[4.2.121]]. Here there is no shortening of a long आ, and hence no option is allowed. But in इभ्यका or इभ्यिका the long आ has been shortened. Because this word is thus derived: इभमर्हति = इभ्या (दण्डादिभ्योयः [[5.1.66]]). To this क is added, and the long आ is shortened.

Why is the word स्थान used in the <i>sutra</i>, when by the general rule षष्ठी स्थाने योगः this word would be understood here? The special mention is for the sake of pointing out that the अ which takes the place of आ is intended here: i. e. the इ replaces this short अ; but had the word स्थाने not been used in the <i>sutra</i> the इ would have replaced the long आ ॥
