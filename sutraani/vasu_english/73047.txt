According to the opinion of Northern Grammarians इ is not substituted for that अ which is obtained by shortening the long आ of the feminine (under sūtra केऽणः [[7.4.13]]) of 1. भस्त्रा 2. एषा 3. अजा 4. ज्ञा 5. द्वा -- त्यदादीनामः [[7.2.102]], and 6. स्वा even not then when the negative particle precedes them.
As भस्त्रका or भस्त्रिका, अभस्त्रका or अभस्त्रिका, एषका or एषिका, अजका or अजिका, ज्ञका or ज्ञिका, अज्ञका or अज्ञिका, द्वके or द्विके, स्वका or स्विका, अस्वका or अस्विका ॥ Of एषा and द्वि there are no examples with the negative particle. For if the compounding with नञ् takes place after the addition of the अकच्, or on the contrary, if first अकच् be added and then the नञ् compounding takes place, in both alternatives, the case-affixes must be added in order to substitute अ for the final by [[7.2.102]]: and it is only when this अ is substituted that the feminine टाप् can come. So that the case-affix is the principal ingredient, and टाप् comes after सुप्, and therefore by the prohibition of असुपः in [[7.3.44]], there can arise no occasion for the substitution of इ ॥ Therefore अनेषका and अंद्वके are the invariable forms of these words with the negative particle. स्व meaning agnates and property, takes the negative particle. भस्त्रा is a word which has no corresponding masculine form, and as such, by the following rule [[7.3.48]] it would not have taken इ; its special mention here indicates that it should be the secondary member of the compound here: as अविद्यमाना भस्त्रा यस्या = अभस्त्रा, the Diminutive of which is अभस्त्रका or अभस्त्रिका ॥ Here first the भस्त्रा is shortened as it is a secondary member (<i>upasarjana</i>), then when the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> is made, the feminine affix टाप् is added to this भाषितपुंस्क word, then this आ is shortened before क by [[7.4.13]]. This short अ [[7.4.13]] does not come in the room of the आ which is ordained to come after a word having no corresponding masculine.

The force of अपि shows that the rule applies, when words other than नञ् also precede, and even when no words precede. As निर्भस्त्रिका or निर्भस्त्रका, बहुभस्त्रिका or बहुभस्त्रका ॥

Note: The form द्वके is from the word द्वकि, dual number, the final इ is changed to अ (त्यदाद्यत्व), then the feminine आ (टाप्) is added (द्वका), and then शी is substituted for औ ॥
