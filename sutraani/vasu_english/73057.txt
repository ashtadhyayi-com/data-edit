ज् in जि 'to conquer' after a reduplication before the Desiderative affix सन् and in the लिट् (Perfect Tense).
As जिगीषति, जिगाय ॥ Why in the Desiderative and Perfect only? Observe जेजीयते ॥ Though the root ज्या also assumes the form जि by vocalisation [[6.1.16]], [[6.1.17]] yet that जि is not to be taken here. That will form जिज्यतुः, जिज्युः ॥
