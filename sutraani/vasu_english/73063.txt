A guttural is not substituted for the palatal of वञ्च् in the sense of 'going'.
A वञ्च्यं वञ्चन्ति वणिजः, but वाङ्क्यं काष्ठं = कुटिलं ॥ Why is गतौ used, when we know from the <i>Dhatupatha</i> (<i>Bhuadi</i> 204) that वंच् means 'to go'? The specification shows that the roots possess many meanings other than those assigned to them in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>.
