ओक is irregularly formed from the root उच् with the affix क (अ).
The change of च् into क्, and the <i>Guna</i> are the irregularities. As न्योकः 'a bird, a tree'. The affix क is added under [[3.1.135]]. The क is added with the force of घञ् the <i>Karaka</i> relation being that of Location &c. The घञ् affix would have given the form regularly, but then the word would have been acutely accented on the first syllable, but it is desired that the acute should be on the last. The words दिवौकसः, जलौकसः &c are also irregular, formed with the <i>Unadi</i> affix असुन् the क् being substituted for च् as an <i>Unadi</i> diversity (<i>bahulam</i>).
