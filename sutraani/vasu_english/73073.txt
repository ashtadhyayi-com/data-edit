The whole of the affix क्स is optionally elided before the personal endings of आत्मनेपद beginning with a dental, after 1. दुह् 2. दिह् 3. लिह् and 4. गुह्।
As अदुग्ध or अधुक्षत, अदुग्धा or अधुक्षथाः, अदुग्ध्वम् or अधुक्षध्वम्, अदुह्वहि or अधुक्षावहि, अदिग्ध or अधिक्षत, अलीढ or अलिक्षत, न्यगुढ or न्यधुक्षत ॥

Why दुह् &c. only? Observe व्यत्यरुक्षत ॥ Why in the <i>Atmanepada</i>? Observe अधुक्षत only. Why before an affix beginning with a dental? Observe अधुक्षामहि only. Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of लोप was understood in this <i>sutra</i>; the employment of the term लुक् indicates that the whole of the affix is to be elided. For लोप would have elided only the final अ of स ॥ But even with the elision of अ alone we would have got all the above forms, except those in वहि ॥ For अ being elided, we have स् between ह् (a consonant of झल् class) and a dental (which is also a letter of झल् class). This स् situate between two झल् will be elided by [[8.2.26]]. Nor can it be objected that the elided अ is <i>sthanivat</i>, for by पूर्वत्रासिद्धं [[8.2.1]], such an elision cannot be <i>sthanivat</i>. Though व् is a dento-labial, yet it is included in the word dental. Had it not been meant to be so included, तौ (letters of त class) would have been taken in the <i>sutra</i>. See [[3.1.45]], for this Aorist-affix.
