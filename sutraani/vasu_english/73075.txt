Before any other Present character (शित्) the root vowel of 1. ष्ठिव् 2. क्लम् and 3.आ-चम् is lengthened.
As ष्ठीवति, क्लामति, and आ चामति ॥ क्लम् lengthens its vowel before श्यन् by the last rule, the present rule produces this change before the affix शप् also, which it gets by [[3.1.70]]. चम् lengthens its vowel only when it is preceded by आ; therefore not here: चमति, विचमति or उचमति ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is exhibited as ष्ठिवुक्लमु चमां शिति  in the original text of <i>Panini</i>; the present form, owes its existence to the insertion of आ from the <i>vartika</i> दीर्घत्वमाङि चमः ॥
