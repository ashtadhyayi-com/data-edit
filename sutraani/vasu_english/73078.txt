Before a Present-character (शित्) the following substitutions take place - 1. पिब् for पा 2. जिघ्र for घ्रा 3. धम् for ध्मा 4. तिष्ठ् for स्था 5. मन् for म्ना 6. यछ् for दा (दाण्) 7. पश्य for दृश् 8. ऋच्छ् for ऋ 9. धौ for सृ 10. शीय् for शद् and 11. सीद् for सद्।
As पिबति, जिघ्रति, धमति, तिष्ठति, मनति, यच्छति, पश्यति, ऋच्छति, धावति, शीयते and सीदति ॥ पिब् + शप् + तिप् required <i>Guna</i> of the इ of पि by [[7.3.86]], it however does not take place on the maxim: अङ्गवृत्ते पुनर्वृत्तावविधिः "when an operation which is taught in the <i>angadhikara</i>, has taken place, and another operation of the <i>angadhikara</i> is subsequently applicable, this latter operation is not allowed to take place". Or the substitute पिब is one which ends with अ, and is acutely accented on the first. It must be acutely accented on the first; otherwise by [[6.1.162]], the acute will be on the last पिब꣡ ॥ Then when there is <i>ekadesa</i> with शप्, the acute will be on the middle in पिब꣡ति, which is not desired. धौ is substituted for सृ when the sense is 'to run, move quickly'; in any other sense, we have प्रसरति, अनुसरति ॥
