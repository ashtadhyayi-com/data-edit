Before a शित् affix, जा is substituted for ज्ञा and जन्।
As जानाति and जायते ॥ The जन् here belongs to <i>Divadi</i> class, meaning 'to be produced', and not जन् of the <i>Juhotyadi</i> class. Why जा (long) and not ज, for this ज would assume the form जा by [[7.3.101]]? This long आ of जा indicates the existence of the maxim given above in [[7.3.78]]; and had ज been the substitute, [[7.3.101]], could not have lengthened it.
