Before a personal ending जुस् (उस्) of the Imperfect, गुण is substituted for the final 1. इ 2. ई 3. उ. 4. ऊ 5. ऋ 6. ॠ and 7. ऌ।
As अजुहवुः, अबिभयुः, अबिभरुः, अजागरुः ॥ This Personal ending is ङित् according to [[1.2.4]], and would not have caused <i>guna</i> [[1.1.5]], but for this <i>sutra</i>. The ending जुस (III.4. I08) comes in the लिङ् also. There, however, it does not cause <i>guna</i>. As चिन्युः, सुनुयुः ॥ Here there are two ङित् affixes, the augment यासुट्, and the <i>sarvadhatuka</i> जुस्; and the यासुट् prevents <i>guna</i>. The इक् is read into the <i>sutra</i> from [[1.1.3]].
