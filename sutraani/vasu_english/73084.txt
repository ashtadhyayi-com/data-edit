The गुण is substituted for the final इक् vowel of a अङ्ग (stem) before the affixes called सार्वधातुक and आर्धधातुक -- तिङ्शित्सार्वधातुकम् [[3.4.113]] etc.
As तरति, नयति, भवति, कर्तृ, चेतृ, स्तोतृ ॥ Why <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affixes only? Observe अग्नित्वम् अग्निकाम्यति ॥ For had the <i>sutra</i> been सङि then the rule would have applied to affixes like सन् काम्यच &c which go to form Denominative verbs. सङ् includes all affixes beginning with सन् and ending with महिङ् ॥ If the <i>sutra</i> had been प्रत्यये, then the rule would have applied to the affixes like त्वम् &c. To exclude these cases, the two words <i>sarvadhatuka</i> and <i>ardhadhatuka</i> are used. For exceptions See [[1.1.4]], [[1.1.5]], [[1.1.6]].
