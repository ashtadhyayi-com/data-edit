The गुण is not substituted for the penultimate light इक् vowel in the reduplicated form of a root, before a सार्वधातुक affix beginning with a vowel and having an indicatory प्।
As नेनिजानि, अनेनिजम्; परिवेविषाणि, पर्यवेविषम् ॥ Why of a reduplicated root? Observe वेदानि ॥ Why beginning with a vowel ? Observe नेनेक्ति ॥ The word पित् is read here for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> like [[7.3.92]]. For here in cases other than पित्, <i>guna</i> will be prevented by ङित् because of सार्वधातुकमपित् ॥ Why a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix? Observe नेनेज in the Perfect, the affixes of which are <i>ardhadhatuka</i> [[3.4.115]]. Why do we say a penultimate light vowel? Observe जुहुवानि, अजुहवम् ॥

Vart:- There is diversity in the <i>Vedas</i>. As जुजोषत् the लेट् of जुस् ॥

The forms पश्पशात, चाकशीति, वावशीति, वावसीतीः are irregular. स्पश् + लेट् = स्पश् + आट् + ते = स्पश् + शप्श्लु+ आते = पस्पशाते ॥

The above forms are thus evolved. 1. ने निजानि is लोट् (Imperative Ist Person Singular), the मि is changed to नि, the augment आट् is added which is पित् (आडुत्तमस्य पिच्च [[3.4.92]]), श्लु is substituted for शप्, then there is reduplication, then <i>guna</i> by [[7.4.75]]. 2. अनानजम् is लङ्, the मिप् is changed to अम् ॥ 3. ददानि is Ist Person Singular Imperative of विद् ॥ 4. ननाक्त is 3rd person singular of the Present. 5. निनज is the Perfect with णल् which is <i>ardhadhtuka</i> [[3.4.115]]. 6. जुजोषत् is the लट् of जुषी प्रीतिसेवनयोः (<i>Tudadi</i> 8), in the <i>Parasmaipada</i>, the इ of तिप् is elided [[3.4.97]], then is added the augment अट् [[3.4.94]] then शप् is irregularly replaced by श्लु, then reduplication.

In the words पस्पशाते &c. the reduplicate has been shortened, as a Vedic form, in the Intensive यङ् लुक्॥ चाकशीत is from काशृदीप्तौ there is (यङ् लुक्, लट्, तिप्, and इट् augment by यङा वा [[7.3.94]]. वावशीतीः is from वाशृदीप्तौ, in the Intensive (यङलुक्), लट्, शत्, ङीप् and शस् i. e. it is the Accusative plural of the Feminine Present Participle from the Intensive root of वाश् ॥ The reading in the <i>Kasika</i> is वावशीति ॥ In these two काश् and वाश् the roots have been shortened. Or the above forms may be derived regularly, without shortening, from the roots कश् and वश् ॥
