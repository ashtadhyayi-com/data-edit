भू and सु get not गुण before an immediately following personal ending which is सार्वधातुक ।
As अभूत्, अभूः, अभुवम्; सुवै, सुवावहै, सुवामहै ॥ The सू refers to the <i>Adadi</i> root (21) in which the Present character is dropped, and does not refer to <i>Divadi</i> (24) or <i>Tudadi</i> (115) roots, because there the Present character श्यन् and श intervene between the Personal endings (तिङ्) and the root: and moreover the affixes श्यन् and श are ङित् [[1.2.4]] and would not cause <i>guna</i>. Why do we say before तिङ्? Observe भवति where the <i>guna</i> takes place before शप् ॥ Why before a <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affix? Observe व्यति भविषीष्ठ, where the Benedictive is not a <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> [[3.4.116]], and the augment is of course considered as a portion of the personal ending. Why the <i>guna</i> is not prohibited in बोभवीति when the Intensive यङ् is dropped, and the Personal ending is added directly to the root. Because the form बोभूतु in [[7.4.65]] indicates by implication that <i>guna</i> takes place in यङलुक् except in बोभूतु ॥

But of सू we have सोषुवीति where <i>guna</i> has been prohibited in the Intensive, because there is no <i>jnapaka</i> with regard to it.

The forms सुवै &c are the 1st Person Imperative of सू ॥
