Before a पित् सार्वधातुक affix beginning with a consonant, इ is added after अ of the verbal stem तृणह्।
As तृणेढि, तृणेक्षि, तृणेह्मि, अतृणेट् ॥ In the last example though the affix vanishes altogether, yet it produces its effect. Why beginning with a consonant? Observe तृणहानि ॥ Why a पित् affix? Observe तृण्ढः with तस् ॥ The stem तृणह is formed from the root तृह् (<i>Rudhadi</i>) with the <i>vikarana</i> श्नम्, and is so exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> in order to indicate that the augment इम् is added after the <i>vikarana</i> श्नम् has been added, and that the root तृह् of <i>Tudadi</i> class is not to be taken.

The above forms are thus derived:-

तृह् + श्नम् + तिप् = तृणह् + इम् + ति = तृणइह + ति = तृणेह् + ति [[6.1.87]] = तृणेढ् + ति [[8.2.31]] = तृणेढ् + धि [[8.2.40]] = तृणेढ् + ढि [[8.4.41]] = तृणेढि with the elision of one ढ [[8.3.13]]. The form तृणेक्षि is similarly formed by [[8.2.41]], the ढ् being changed to क before सि of सिप् ॥ अतृणेट् is the लङ् 2nd and 3rd Person Singular.
