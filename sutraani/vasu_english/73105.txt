Before the case-ending ओस् and before आ of the Instrumental -3rd case, ए is substituted for the final आ of the feminine affix.
आङ् is the name given to the affix टा, the Instrumental Singular by the ancient grammarians. As खट्वया, मालया, खट्वयोः, मालयोः, बहुराजया, कारीषगन्ध्यया, बहुराजयोः, कारीषगन्ध्ययोः ॥ Why the आ of the Feminine affix only? Observe कीलालपा ब्राह्मणेन कीलालपो ब्राह्मणकुलयोः ॥ Where ever ङी or आप् is employed in Grammar, they mean the long forms ई and आ, and not when they are shortened, therefore, not here, अतिखट्वेन ब्राह्मणकुलेन ॥

The word कीलालपा is derived from कीलालं पिबति with the affix विच् [[3.2.74]]. In the Instrumental Singular the final आ is elided by [[6.4.140]]. Had therefore, आ only been used in the <i>sutra</i>, instead of आप्, there would have been ए substitution in the case of कीलालपा also; for the लोप् rule [[6.4.140]] would find its scope in कीलालपः पश्य &c, and would be debarred here by the present <i>sutra</i>.

The maxim ङ्याब् ग्रहणेऽदीर्घग्रहणम् is necessary, because otherwise on the maxim of <i>sthanivadbhava</i>, the short substitutes of ङी and आप् would also be included. In fact, in the <i>sutra</i> prohibiting <i>sthanivad</i> <i>bhava</i>, we find this <i>vartika</i> ङ्याब् ग्रहणेऽदीर्घः "A short (not long) substitute of ङा and आप् is not <i>sthanivat</i>".
