For the short इ and उ final in a nominal-stem, a गुण is substituted in the Vocative Case singular.
As हे अग्ने, हे वायो, हे पटो ॥ But there is no <i>guna</i> in हे कुमारि, हे ब्रह्मबन्धु, because ई and ऊ were shortened specifically, and to substitute <i>guna</i> for them would make their shortening a useless operation. Moreover, had <i>guna</i> been intended in the case of these <i>nadi</i> words, the <i>sutra</i> would have been अम्बार्थानां ह्रस्वः, २ नदीह्रस्वयोर्गुणः ॥
