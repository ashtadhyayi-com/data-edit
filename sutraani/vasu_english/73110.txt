गुण is substituted for the final ऋ of a अङ्ग (stem) in the Locative -7th case singular and in the strong cases.
As मातरि, पितरि, भ्रातरि, कर्तरि; मातरौ, पितरौ, भ्रातरौ, कर्तारौ, कर्तारः ॥ For the long in कर्तारौ and कर्तारः see [[6.4.11]]. The त् in ऋत् is for the sake of facility of utterance.

Because before ङि and strong cases, it is impossible for a stem to end in a long vowel ॠ nor a <i>dhatu</i> noun can so come, since in that case, long ॠ would be changed to इर् by [[7.1.100]], and in forms like कर्तॄणि there is नुम् ॥
