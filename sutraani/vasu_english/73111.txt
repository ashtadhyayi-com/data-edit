For the इ and उ of the stems called घि -- यू स्त्र्याख्यौ नदी [[1.4.3]], गुण is substituted in the Dative -4th Case, Ablative -5th case and Genitive 6th-Case singular.
As अग्नये, वायवे, आग्नेः, वायोः, [[6.1.110]]. Why of घि stems? Observe सख्ये, पत्ये ॥ Why in the Singulars of the Dative, Ablative and Locative only? Observe अग्निः-भ्याम् ॥ The word case ending (सुपि) is understood here also, as the counter-examples are पट्वी, कुरुतः ॥

The word पट्वी is formed by adding ङीष् to पटु [[4.1.44]]. ङीष् is not a case-affix, though it is ङित् and is added to पटु which is घि ॥ कुरुतः is no proper example: for though तस् which is added to कुरु is ङित्, it is only so by <i>atidesa</i> (सार्वधातुकमपित्), and moreover कुरु is not घि ॥
