After all the feminine नदी -- यू स्त्र्याख्यौ नदी [[1.4.3]] etc., words ending in a short इ and उ , आम् is substituted for the इ of the Locative -7th case singular.
As कृत्याम्, धेन्वाम् ॥ See (1.4. 6).

The word नदी is understood here also. Objection: If this be so, it is not a really separate <i>sutra</i>, because it is included in the last, and these forms could be obtained by the last <i>sutra</i>: so that we ought to make only one <i>sutra</i> of 117 and 118, as इदुद्भ्यामौत् ॥ Answer: We could not have done so, for then in the case of कृति and धेनु, the औ would have come and not आ, in this way. The आम् would have found scope in <i>nadi</i> words like कुमार्याम्, the औ would have undisputed scope in पत्यौ and सख्यौ; but in the case of कृति when getting the designation नदी the औ would have come, being subsequently taught, and the form would have been कृत्यौ instead of कृत्याम् ॥
