After a अङ्ग (stem) ending in short इ and उ and which is not नदी -- यू स्त्र्याख्यौ नदी [[1.4.3]] or घि -- शेषो घ्यसखि [[1.4.7]], औ is substituted for the इ of the Locative -7th case singular.
As सख्यौ, पत्यौ ॥

In the case of नदी words आम् is taught by the previous <i>sutras</i>; in the case of घी words औ preceded by अ substitution of घि letters will be taught in the next <i>sutra</i>, so by the rule of exclusion, the present <i>sutra</i> applies to words other than <i>nadi</i> and <i>ghi</i>.
