The shortening of the penultimate of the stem, before the causative affix in the reduplicated Aorist, does not take place, when it is a (Denominative) अङ्ग (stem), which has lost a simple (end vowel of the Nominal stem) before the Causative sign and also not, when it is the verb शास् , or a root which has an indicatory ऋ।
The word अग्लोपिन् means literally a stem, in which a simple vowel (अक् <i>pratyahara</i>) or a portion containing an अक् vowel has been dropped. As the final vowels of Denominative stems are so elided before the Causative sign णि, the <i>sutra</i> has been translated accordingly. Thus अममालत् = मालामाख्यत्; अममातरत् = मातरमाख्यत्, अत्यरराजत् = राजानमतिक्रान्तवान्, अन्वलुलामत् = लोमान्यनुमृष्टवान् ॥ Where a simple अक् vowel alone is elided, as in the case of माला, there the elided आ being <i>sthanivat</i>, would prevent the shortening, the आ of मा not being then considered penultimate. So that अग्लोपिन् could be spared from the <i>sutra</i>, since the <i>sthanivad</i>-<i>bhava</i> would prevent shortening. But where an अक् vowel plus a consonant is dropped, as in राजन् and लोमन्, there the <i>sthanivad</i>-<i>bhava</i> does not apply [[1.1.57]], hence the necessity of employing the term अग्लोपिन् in the <i>sutra</i>. Similarly अशशासत् with शास्; and अबबाधत् from बाधृ, अययाचत् from याचृ, and अडुढौकत् from ढौकृ ॥ See [[3.1.21]] and [[2.1.2]].
