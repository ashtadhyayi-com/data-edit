The penultimate vowel in the Causative अङ्ग (stem) पा 'to drink' is elided in the Aorist and for the vowel of the reduplicate there is substituted long ई।
As पा + णि + अत् = पाय् + इ + अत् [[7.3.37]] = पाय् + अत् [[6.4.51]] = प्य् + अत् [[7.4.8]] = पप्य् + अत् [[1.1.59]] = पीप्यत् [[7.4.4]]. Thus अपीप्यत्, अपीप्यताम्, अपीप्यन् ॥ When the penultimate आ is elided, there remains प् which cannot be reduplicated as having no vowel, but the elided आ is considered as <i>sthanivat</i> and thus पा is reduplicated. <i>Sutra</i> [[7.4.80]] establishes by implication the principle that the substitutes caused by णि are <i>sthanivat</i>. Thus भू + णि = भावि; in reduplicating, this भा will not be reduplicated, but भू, as बुभावि, भा = भू by <i>sthanivad</i>-<i>bhava</i>.
