दिगि is substituted for दे (दयते) in the लिट् (Perfect Tense).
As अव दिग्ये, अव दिग्याते, अव दिग्यिर ॥ The root देङ् 'to protect' (<i>Bhuadi</i> 1011) is to be taken, and not दय 'to give' (<i>Bhuadi</i> 510), for that root forms its Perfect by आम् (Periphrastic Perfect) as taught in [[3.1.37]]. The substitute दिगि debars reduplication.
