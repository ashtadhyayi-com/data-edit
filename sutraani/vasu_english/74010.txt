A root ending in short ऋ and preceded by a conjunct consonant gets गुण in the लिट् (Perfect Tense).
As सस्वरतुः, सस्वरुः from स्वृ, दध्वरतुः, दध्वरुः from ध्वृ, सस्मरतुः, सस्मरुः from स्मृ ॥ Why do we say ending in ऋ? Observe चिक्षियतुः, चिर्क्षियुः ॥ Why do we say beginning with a conjunct consonant? Observe चक्रतुः, चक्रुः ॥ This <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>Guna</i> where there was prohibition by [[1.2.5]] read with [[1.1.5]]. But this does not debar the <i>Vriddhi</i> caused by णल् [[7.1.115]]. In fact, that prior rule supersedes this posterior rule, as सस्वार, दध्वार, सस्मार ॥ The word लिटि is to be supplied in the <i>sutra</i>, the rule does not apply to <i>Nishtha</i> &c., as स्मृतः, स्मृतवान् ॥

Vart:- For the sake of कृञ्, the <i>guna</i> should be stated even where the double-consonant is in the penultimate position and not in the beginning. As संचस्करतुः, संचस्करुः ॥ See [[6.1.135]]. On the maxim पूर्वं धातुः साधनेन युज्यते पश्चादुपसर्गेण 'a root is first developed fully and then the preposition is added to it'; we first develop कृ in the Perfect by reduplication, which gives us चकृ + अतुस्, then we add the preposition as संचकृ + अतुः, then we add सुट् though the reduplicate intervenes, by [[6.1.136]] and [[6.1.137]], as संचस्कृ + अतुः, now the root assumes a form in which the penultimate begins with a double consonant, and applying the <i>vartika</i> we make <i>guna</i>, and get संचस्करतुः ॥

It is by this consideration that in संस्कृषीष्ट, उपस्कृषीष्ट, the सुट् augment being <i>Bahiranga</i> and consequently considered as non-existent (<i>asiddha</i>), there
is no इट् augment added by [[7.2.43]].
