There is गुण in the लिट् (Perfect Tense) of 1. ऋच्छ् 2. ॠ and roots ending in long ॠ।
As आनर्च्छ, आनर्च्छतुः, आनर्च्छुः from ऋच्छ्, आर, आरतुः, आरुः from ऋ, and नि चकरतुः, नि चकरुः, नि जगरतुः, नि जगरुः from कॄ and गॄ ॥ ऋच्छ् not having a light vowel in the penultimate, would not have received <i>guna</i> by [[7.3.86]], this <i>sutra</i> ordains it; roots in long ॠ never received <i>guna</i>, but इर् substitution; this ordains <i>guna</i>. The <i>Vriddhi</i> of [[7.2.115]] supersedes this rule, within its own jurisdiction, a prior superseding the posterior: as निचकार, नि जगार ॥
