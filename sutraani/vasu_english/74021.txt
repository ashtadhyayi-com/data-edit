For the vowel of शी there is substituted गुण when a सार्वधातुक affix follows.
As शेते, शयाते, शेरते, but शिश्ये before the <i>ardhadhatuka</i> affix [[3.4.115]]. Though these <i>sarvadhatuka</i> affixes were ङित् [[1.2.4]] and would not have caused <i>guna</i> (l. 4.5), they do so by virtue of the present <i>sutra</i>. The word शीङ् is read in the <i>sutra</i> with the <i>anubandha</i> ङ्, in order to indicate that the rule does not apply to यङ् लुक् as शेशीतः, शेश्यति ॥
