A long is substituted for the final vowel of the अङ्ग (stem) before an affix beginning with य् having an indicatory क् or ङ् , when it is not a कृत् or a सार्वधातुक affix.
Thus भृशायते, सुखायते, and दुःखायते with the Denominative affix क्यङ् according to [[3.1.12]] and [[3.1.18]]. चीयते and स्तूयते with the Passive यक्, चेचीयते and तोष्टूयते with the Intensive यङ्, and चीयात् and स्तूयात् in the Benedictive (See [[3.4.116]]. But प्रकृत्य and प्रहृत्य where the affix ल्यप् is <i>krit</i>, and had the vowel been lengthened by this subsequent rule, the antecedent तुक् augment would have been debarred [[6.1.71]]. And चिनुयात् and सुनुयात् where the Personal endings of the Potential are <i>sarvadhatuka</i>. The phrase क्ङिति is understood in this <i>sutra</i>, so there is no lengthening before non-<i>kit</i> and non-<i>nit</i> affixes, as, उरुया, धृष्णुया, formed by या under [[7.1.39]].
