गुण is substituted for the final ऋ in the root ऋ (अर्ति) and in those roots ending in ऋ in which the vowel is preceded by a conjunct consonant, when the Passive character यक् or the Benedictive augment यास् follows.
The words ऋतः, यकि and लिङि are understood here. Not so the word श as its <i>anuvritti</i> is impossible. Thus अर्यते, अर्यात्, स्मर्यते and स्मर्यात् ॥ This is an exception to [[1.1.5]]. In सं स्क्रियते and संस्क्रियात् [[6.1.135]], there is no <i>Guna</i>, either because in स्कृ the augment स् is considered as <i>Bahiranga</i> and therefore <i>asiddha</i>, or because it is considered as no part of (or non-attached to) कृ, and therefore स् कृ is not a root beginning with a conjunct consonant. See however [[7.4.10]], where in forming संचस्करतुः, स्कृ is considered as a root beginning with a conjunct consonant. See also <i>Mahabhashya</i> on [[6.1.135]]. The यि [[7.4.22]] is understood here also; the Benedictive affix must begin with य, therefore not here स्वृषीष्ट, ध्वृषीष्ट ॥ The word non-<i>sarvadhatuka</i> is also understood here, the rule does not apply to the Potential, as इयृयात्, there is <i>slu</i> substitution of <i>sap</i>, reduplication, then there is इ substitution in the reduplicate by [[7.4.77]], then इयङ् by [[6.4.78]].
