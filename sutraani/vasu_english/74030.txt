गुण is substituted for the final ऋ in those roots ending in ऋ in which the vowel is preceded by a conjunct consonant, when the Intensive character यङ् follows.
As अरार्यते, सास्वर्यते, दाध्वर्यते, सास्मर्यते ॥ The root ऋ takes यङ् according to a <i>Vartika</i> under <i>Sutra</i> [[3.1.22]], with <i>Guna</i> we have ऋ + य = अर्य ॥ By [[6.1.2]], the second member is reduplicated, in spite of the prohibition in [[6.1.3]], for according to <i>Patanjali</i> र् followed by य is not governed by that prohibition. So we have अर्यर्य, and according to [[7.4.60]], the य् is dropped, and we have अरर्य, and according to [[7.4.60]], the य् is dropped, and we have अरर्य, and by [[7.4.83]], we get अरार्य ॥ This is an exception to [[1.1.5]].  

Vart:- In the Intensive of हन् 'to kill', घ्नी is substituted for हन् as जेघ्नीयते ॥ The substitute is with a long ई, had it been with a short इ, that might also have been lengthened by [[7.4.25]]. Not doing so, however, indicates the existence of the maxim संज्ञापूर्वकविधेरनित्यत्वम् "A rule is not universally valid, when that which is taught in it is denoted by a technical term". It is through this that स्वायंभुवः is formed from स्वयंभू; because the <i>Guna</i> taught by [[6.4.146]], does not take place here before the <i>Taddhita</i> affix अण्, in as much as that rule [[6.4.146]], is taught by employing the technical term गुणः in ओर्गुणः instead of ओरोत्, hence that rule is <i>anitya</i>, and we have उवङ् ॥

Why do we say when meaning 'to kill'? Observe जङ्घन्यते where it means to do.
