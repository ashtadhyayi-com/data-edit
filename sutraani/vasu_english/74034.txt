The Denominative roots 1. अशनाय 2. उदन्य and 3. धनाय are irregularly formed when they respectively mean 1. 'to be hungry' 2. 'to be thirsty' and 3. 'to be greedy'.
Thus अशनायति from अशन + क्यच्, आ instead of ई; the other form being अशनीयति who is not hungry at the time, but wishes to get food for some future occasion, and therefore when not meaning 'to be hungry'; उदन्यति 'he is thirsty', उदन् being substituted for उदक; in any other sense we have उदकीयति, who wants water for purposes of bathing &c. धनायति 'he is greedy'; in any other sense, धनीयति who is poor, and therefore wishes to get riches.
