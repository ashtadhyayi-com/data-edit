The final स् of तास् (the character of the second future) and अस् 'to be' is elided before an affix beginning with स् ।
As कर्त्तासि, कर्त्तासे, त्वमसि, ष्यति से ॥ See [[6.4.111]]. In से the अ and स् both of अस् have been elided, the अ by [[6.4.111]], and स् by the present <i>sutra</i>,so that the mere suffix से remains, which however here is a finite verb: hence the स, is not changed to ष ॥ See [[8.3.111]].
