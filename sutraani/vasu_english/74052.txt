The स् of तास् (the character of the second future) and अस् 'to be' is substituted ह् before the personal-ending ए।
As कर्त्ताहे, and व्यति हे from अस् ॥ See [[6.4.111]]. The ह substitution does not take place before the Personal ending एश् [[3.4.8]], as एधामासे ॥ The reason of this is that the ए referred to in this <i>sutra</i>, is that ए which can come after तास्; and that very ए should also come after अस् ॥ The ए that can come after तास् is the Ist Person singular ए; and not this ए of the Perfect 3rd Person singular. Others say, this even <i>sarvadhatuka</i>, and therefore not here सुप्तोऽहं त्वां प्रेक्षामासे ॥
