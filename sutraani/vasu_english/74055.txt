For the vowel of the roots 1. आप् 2. ज्ञपि and 3. ऋध् there is substituted long ई before सन् of the Desiderative when it begins with स्।
Thus आप्-ईप्सति, ज्ञपि-ज्ञीप्सति, ऋध्-ईर्त्सति [[1.1.51]]. The reduplication is dropped by [[7.4.58]]. In the Causative stem ज्ञपि there are two vowels, the इ (णि) is dropped by <i>purva</i>-<i>vipratishedha</i> (the prior debarring the subsequent) according to [[6.4.51]], and ई (substituted for अ according to the present <i>sutra</i>. The word सन् is to be read into the <i>sutra</i>, otherwise प्रापस्यति ॥ The सन् must begin with स् i.e should not take the इट् augment, as in जिज्ञपयिषति, अर्हिधिषति ॥ The roots ज्ञपि and ऋध् are optionally सेट् in the Desiderative by [[7.2.49]].
