When मुच् has an Intransitive signification गुण is optionally substituted for its vowel before the अनिट् सन् of the Desiderative.
By [[1.2.10]], after a root ending in a consonant, the सन् is like कित् and does not cause <i>Guna</i>. The present <i>sutra</i> ordains it optionally. As मोक्षते or मुमुक्षते वत्सः स्वयमेव ॥ In the Transitive there is one form only, as मुमुक्षति वत्सं देवदत्तः ॥ मुच् becomes Intransitive when it has a Reflexive significance, or when it expresses a mere action. The reduplication is elided by [[7.4.58]].
