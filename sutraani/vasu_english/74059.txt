A short is substituted for the long vowel of the reduplicate.
As डुढौकिषते, तुत्रौकिषते, डुढौके, तुत्रौके, अडुढौकत्, अतुत्रौकत् ॥

Vart:- The shortening takes place before affixes other than अच् [[3.1.134]] Before अच्, the roots चर्, चल्, पत् and वद् are reduplicated, and the augment अक् added to the reduplicate. See [[6.1.12]] <i>Vartika</i>. This augment when added to the reduplicate, is not to be shortened by this rule: and because this is not to be shortened, also indicates that the consonants of the reduplicate other than the first are also not dropped: as चराचरः, चलाचलः, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥
