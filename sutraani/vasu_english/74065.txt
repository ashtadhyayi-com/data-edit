In the छन्दस् (Vedas) are found the following eighteen irregularly reduplicated forms - 1. दाधर्ति 2. दर्धर्ति 3. दर्धर्षि 4. बोभूतु 5. तेतिक्ते 6. अलर्षि 7. आपनीफणत् 8. संसनिष्यदत् 9. करिक्रत् 10. कनिक्रदत् 11.भरिभ्रत् 12. द्दविध्वतः 13. दविद्युतत् 14. तरित्रतः 15. सरीसृपतम् 16. वरीवृजत् 17. मर्मृज्य and 18. आगनीगन्ति।
The word छन्दसि is drawn in to this <i>sutra</i>, by force of च ॥ The form दाधर्त्ति, is either from the Causative of the root धृङ् अवस्थाने or from धृञ्, in the श्लु or यङ् लुक्, there is lengthening of the <i>abhyasa</i> and elision of णि ॥ (2) So also दर्धर्त्ति is the form in <i>slu</i>, with रुक् augment of the <i>abhyasa</i>. (3) दर्धर्षि if it be a form of यङ् लुक्, there is no irregularity. (4) बोभूतु is from भू in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), Imperative, irregularly without <i>guna</i>. Question: There is no necessity of including this, because there would be no <i>guna</i> regularly even under [[7.3.88]]? Answer: The inclusion of बोभूतु is a <i>jnapaka</i>, indicating that in every other case, the <i>guna</i> is not prohibited in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), as बोभेति, बोभवीति (लट् with ईट् [[7.3.94]]) (5) तेतिक्तं is from तिज् in the Intensive <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>, <i>atmanepada</i> is irregular. Question: The यङ् is ङित् and therefore by <i>pratyaya</i> <i>lakshana</i> rule [[1.1.62]] read with [[1.3.12]], the यङ् लुक् will be <i>atmanepadi</i>, where is the necessity of reading this <i>nipatan</i>? Answer: The <i>atmanepada</i> <i>nipatan</i> is a <i>jnapaka</i>, that in the Intensive <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i> the <i>atmanepada</i> affixes are not employed. (6) अलर्षि is from the root ॠ (इयर्ति), in Present, 2nd Person, the र् of <i>abhyasa</i> is not elided, though required by [[7.4.60]], and this र् is changed to ल irregularly. This form is found in the 3rd Person also, as अलर्त्ति दक्षः ॥ (7) आ पमीफणत् is from फण् with आ augment, and शतृ affix is added to यङ् लुक्, and in the reduplicate मी is added. (8) संसनिष्यदत् is from स्यन्द with the Preposition सम्, in the Intensive yan <i>luk</i>, with शतृ affix, नि being added in the <i>abhyasa</i>, the root स is changed to ष ॥ The Preposition सं is not absolutely necessary, with other Prepositions also we have this form, as आ तमिष्यदत् ॥ (9) करिक्रत् is from कृ (करोति), in the Intensive <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>, with शतृ, in the <i>abhyasa</i> there is no palatal change [[7.4.62]], and रि is added to the reduplicate. (10) कनिक्रदत् from क्रन्द् in the Aorist with अङ्, reduplication, there is no <i>chutva</i> ( VII.4.62) of the reduplicate, and the augment नि is added. In the secular literature, the form is अक्रन्दीत् ॥ (11) भरिभ्रत् from भृ (बिभर्ति) in <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i> with शतृ, without इ of [[7.4.76]], without <i>jastva</i>, and रि is added to the reduplicate. (12) दविध्वतः from ध्वृ (ध्वरते) in the <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>, <i>satr</i>, plural number Nominative. The रि is added to the reduplicate, the ऋ is elided, दविध्वतः रश्मयः सूर्यस्य ॥ (13) दविद्युतम् is from <i>dyut</i>, <i>yan</i> <i>luk</i> with <i>satr</i>, there is no vocalisation of the reduplicate, with अ change and वि augment, (14) तरित्रतः from तृ (तरति) with <i>slu</i>, <i>satr</i>, genitive singular: and रि added to <i>abhyasa</i>. (15) सरीसृपत् from सृप् with <i>slu</i>, <i>satr</i>, Accusative with री added to <i>abhyasa</i>. (16) वरीवृजत् from वृज् with <i>slu</i>, <i>satr</i> and री augment. (17) मर्मृज from मृज् with लिट् (Perfect) णल्, म् added to <i>abhyasa</i>, and य added to the root, and there is no <i>vriddhi</i>, because there is no short penultimate now. In fact [[7.2.114]] is to be qualified by the words लघूपध from [[7.3.86]]. (18) आ गनीगन्ति is from गम् with the Preposition आ, in the Perfect, with <i>slu</i>, there is no <i>chutva</i> ( VII.4.62), and augment मी is added. वक्ष्यन्ती वेदा गनीगन्ति कर्णम् ॥

The word इति in the aphorism indicates that other forms, similar to these, are also to be included.
