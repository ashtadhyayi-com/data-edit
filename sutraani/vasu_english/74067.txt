There is vocalisation of the half-vowel of the reduplicate of द्युत् and स्वापि (Causative of स्वप्).
As वि विद्युतत्, वि विद्योतिषते, वि विद्युतिषते, [[1.2.26]] वि देद्युत्यते ॥ स्वापि-सुष्वापयिषति ॥ The Causative of स्वप् is taken here, and the vocalisation takes place then only, when it is immediately followed by an affix which causes reduplication. Therefore not here, स्वापि + ण्वुल् = स्वापकः; स्वापक + क्यच् = स्वापकीय, स्वापकीय + सन् = सिष्वापकीयिषति ॥

The simple root स्वप् will get vocalised in its reduplicate by [[6.1.15]], [[6.1.17]] in the Perfect. The Desiderative of स्वप् is कित् by [[1.2.8]], and therefore the reduplicate of स्वप् will be vocalised before सन् by [[6.1.15]]. The reduplicate of स्वप् will be vocalised in the Intensive also by [[6.1.19]].

Quere:- Does the reduplicate of the Desiderative of the Denominative verb द्योतकीयति get vocalised or not.
