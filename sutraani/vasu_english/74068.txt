There is vocalisation of the half-vowel of the reduplicate of व्यथ् in the लिट् (Perfect Tense).
As विव्यथे, विव्यथाते, विव्यथिरे ॥ This ordains the vocalisation of य, which otherwise would have been elided as being a non-initial consonant [[7.4.60]]. The vocalisation of व् is prevented by [[6.1.37]]. Why do we say in the Perfect? Observe वाव्यथ्यते ॥
