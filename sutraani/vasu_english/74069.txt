A long vowel is substituted in the reduplicate of the root इ (एति) before a personal ending of the लिट् (Perfect Tense), which has an indicatory क्।
As ईयतुः, ईयुः ॥ These are thus formed इ + अतुस् = य् + अतुः (य् substituted by इ [[6.4.81]]). Then there is reduplication, the य् becomes <i>sthanivat</i> to इ by [[1.1.59]], and we have इ य् + अतुः and then by the present rule इयतुः ॥ Why do we say before a कित् affix? Observe इयाय, इययिथ ॥
