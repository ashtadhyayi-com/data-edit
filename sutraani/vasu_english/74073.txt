अ is substituted for the vowel of the reduplicate of भू 'to be' in the लिट् (Perfect Tense).
As बभूव, बभूवतुः, बभूवुः, बभूवे ॥ Why do we say 'in the Perfect'? Observe बभूषति and बोभूयते ॥

The word भवतेः is shown in the <i>sutra</i> in the Active Voice, therefore the rule will not apply to Passive and Reflexive forms; as अनुबुभूवे कम्बलो देवदत्तेन ॥ This opinion of <i>Kasika</i>, however, is not endorsed by later Grammarians.
