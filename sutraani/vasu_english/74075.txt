गुण is substituted for the vowel of the reduplicate in the Reduplicated Present form (श्लु) of निज् , विज् and विष्।
Thus नेनेक्ति, वेवेक्ति, वेवेष्टि ॥ The word त्रयाणां could have been spared in this <i>sutra</i>, as these three roots stand at the end of a subdivision, and निजां would have denoted these three without the word <i>trayanam</i>. The word is however used here for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i>. Why do we say in the reduplicated Present form? Observe निनेज in the Perfect.
