In the Reduplicated Present form (श्लु) of the three roots 1. भृ 2. मा (माङ्) and 3. हा (ओहाङ्), इ is substituted for the vowel of the reduplicate. 
As बिभर्त्ति, मिमीते, [[6.4.113]] जिहीते ॥ The word 'three' is understood here, therefore not in ओहाक्-जहाति ॥ The rule applies in the Reduplicated Present system (श्लु) only: therefore not in बभार ॥
