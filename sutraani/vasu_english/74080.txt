इ is substituted for the final उ or ऊ of a reduplicate before a labial, a semi-vowel and before ज् when अ or आ follows these consonants, in the Desiderative.
The word पु-यण्-जि is the Locative singular of the <i>samahara</i> <i>dvandva</i> compound of those three words-पु, यण् and ज् ॥ The <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् [[5.4.106]] does not come, as these affixes are <i>anitya</i>. The word अ-परे means that after which is the letter अ ॥

Thus: 1. Labial:-  पिपविषते, पिपावयिषति, विभावयिषति; 2. Semi-vowel:- यियविषति, यियावयिषति, रिरावयिषति, लिलावयिषति; 3. ज-जिजावयिषति from the root जु ॥

The word पिपविषते is from पू, which gets इट् augment in सन् [[7.2.74]], then there is <i>guna</i>, and अत् substitutions, but these latter being <i>sthanivat</i> for reduplication [[1.1.59]], पू is doubled: and for ऊ there is substituted इ by the present <i>sutra</i>. पिपावयिषति is the Desiderative of the Causative of पू ॥ विभावयिषति is the Desiderative of the Causative of भू ॥ यियविषति is the Desiderative of यु 'to mix', which is सेट् by [[7.2.49]]. यियावयिषति is the Desiderative of the Causative of this root. The words रिरावयिषति and लिलावयिषति are the Desiderative of the Causatives of रौति and लुनाति ॥

This <i>sutra</i> indicates the existence of the following maxim:- अद्विर्वचन निमित्तेऽपि स्थानिवद् भवति, "though not the cause of reduplication, the substitute which takes place when णि follows, becomes like the original". Thus in विभावयिषति we have भावि + सन् from भू + णि + सन्, here the आद् substitute caused by णि is <i>sthanivat</i> to ऊ, otherwise there would be no उ in the reduplicate to be operated upon by the present <i>sutra</i>. See [[6.1.31]] also. Why do we say "for the उ or ऊ"? Observe पापच्यते, the Desiderative of which will be पापचिषति ॥ Why do we say "followed by a labial, semi-vowel or ज"? Observe अव नुनावयिषति, according to <i>Padamanjari</i> it is अव तुता वयिषति from the <i>sautra</i> root तु ॥ जुहावयिषति ॥ Why do we say 'when these consonants are followed by an अ'? Observe बुभूषति ॥
