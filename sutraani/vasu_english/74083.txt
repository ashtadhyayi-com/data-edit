A long vowel is substituted for the अ of the reduplicate in the Intensive (with expressed or elided यङ्) when the reduplicate receives no augment having an indicatory क् ।
The reduplicate receives augments like मीक्, मुक् by the following <i>sutras</i>. Thus पापच्यते, and पापचीति, यायज्यते and यायजीति ॥ Why do we say "when it gets no augment"? Observe यंयम्यते, यंयमीति, रंरम्यते, रंरमीति ॥

Objection:- When the न् augment is added, the reduplicate will end in a consonant, and as it does not end in a vowel, there will be no occasion for lengthening; hence the employment of the term अकितः is useless.

Answer:- The employment of this term by the <i>Acharya</i> indicates the existence of the following maxim : अभ्यासविकारेष्वपवादानोत्सर्गान् विधीन् बाधन्ते "so far as changes of a reduplicative syllable are concerned, rules which teach those changes do not supersede one another". What is the necessity of this indication (<i>jnapaka</i>)? Observe डोढौक्यते, here the rule of lengthening of this <i>sutra</i>, does not supersede, though it is subsequent, the rule of shortening in [[7.4.59]]; so the diphthong औ is shortened to उ, and it is then <i>gunated</i> by [[7.4.82]]. Secondly observe अचीकरत्, here इ is substituted in the reduplicate by [[7.4.79]] plus [[7.4.93]], and then this is lengthened by [[7.4.94]], the latter not superseding the former. Thirdly observe मीमांसते &c, where in मान् + सन् [[3.1.6]], the reduplicate is lengthened, but that does not prevent the इ of [[7.4.79]]. Fourthly observe अजीगणन्, where the ई substitute [[7.4.97]] does not supersede the <i>sutra</i> [[7.4.60]], by which the ण् of गण् is elided.
