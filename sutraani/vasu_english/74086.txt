The augment नुक् (न्) comes after the reduplicates of 1. जप 2. जभ 3. दह 4. दश 5. भञ्ज and 6. पश in the Intensive (with expressed or elided यङ्).
Thus जंजप्यते and जंजपीति; जंजभ्यते and जंजभीति, दंदह्यते and दंदहीति; दंदश्यते and दंदशीति ॥ The root is दंश्, but it is exhibited in the <i>sutra</i> as दश, showing that even in यङ् लुक्, the root loses its nasal. Similarly बंभज्यते and बंभजीति, and पंपश्यते and पंपशीति ॥ This last is a <i>sautra</i> root.
