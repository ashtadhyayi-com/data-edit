For the subsequent अ (i.e. for the अ of the root and not of the reduplicate), there is substituted उ in the Intensive (with expressed or elided यङ्).
The examples have been given above, as चंचूर्यते, चंचूरीते and पंफुल्यते पंफुलीते ॥ Why do we say 'the अ which stands subsequent to the reduplicate'? The substitute does not replace the अ of the reduplicate. Why do we say 'of अ'? The substitute should not replace the final letter, which it otherwise would have done by [[1.1.52]]. The त् in उत् debars <i>guna</i> [[7.3.86]] in चंचूर्ति and पंफुलीति, for though उ is lengthened by [[8.2.77]], in चंचूर्ति, yet that lengthening is considered as non-existent or <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]] for the purposes of <i>Guna</i> [[7.3.86]]. Quere. If the त् in उत् debars <i>guna</i>, why should it not debar lengthening also of [[8.2.7]]?
