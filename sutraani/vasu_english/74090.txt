The reduplicate of a root which has ऋ at the penultimate position, gets the augment री in the Intensive (with expressed or elided यङ्).
As वरीवृत्यते and वरीवृतीति, वरीवृद्ध्यते and वरीवृधीति, नरीनृत्यते and नरीनृतीति ॥

Vart:- It should be rather stated 'a root which contains a ऋ': when यङ् follows, whether this ऋ be of <i>upadesa</i>, or obtained by <i>samprasarana</i>, so that the augment may come in वरीवृश्यते and वरीवृश्चीति where the ऋ is of vocalisation, and not penultimate also.
