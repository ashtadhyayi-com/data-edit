The reduplicate of a root which ends in short ऋ gets, in the Intensive without यङ् the above augments (1. रीक् 2. रुक् and 3. रिक्), 1. रि 2. र् and 3. रि।
<i>Karika</i>:-

किरतिं चर्क्करीतान्तं पचतीत्यत्र यो नयेत् ।
प्राप्तिज्ञं तमहं मन्ये प्रारब्धस्तेन संग्रहः ॥

Thus चकर्ति, चरिकर्ति and चरीकर्ति, जर्हर्ति, जरिहर्ति and जरीहर्ति ॥ Why do we say 'which ends in a short ऋ'? The rule does not apply to roots ending in long ॠ as, चाकर्ति, चाकीर्तः, चाकिरति from कॄ ॥ The word ऋतः qualifies the word अङ्ग and not the word अभ्यास, for an <i>abhyasa</i> is always short, so the त् in ऋत् would become meaningless if the word qualified reduplicate. Therefore कॄ ending in long ॠ does not get रि, र् and रि augments in the reduplicate.

<i>Karika</i>:- He who can conjugate, in the Present tense, the <i>yan</i>-<i>luk</i> Intensive of कॄ and of other roots ending in long ॠ, is considered by me to be a person who has attained to the right knowledge of the employment of the augments र्, री, रि &c: and he has obtained the right use of words.

The word किरति in the <i>Karika</i> is illustrative of all roots like कॄ (किरति) ending in long ॠ ॥ चर्क्करीत is the name given to the यङ् लुक् form of the Intensive, by ancient grammarians. चर्क्करीतान्त means, therefore, a form ending in <i>yan</i>-<i>luk</i>. पचति is illustrative of लट् or Present tense.
