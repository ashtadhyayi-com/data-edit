Of that which is twice uttered, the latter form is called अम्रेडित (repeated).
Thus in चौर चौर ३, वृषल वृषल ३ दस्यो ३ घातयिष्यामि त्वा, बन्धयिष्यामि त्वा, the second word being <i>amredita</i> is <i>pluta</i>. The word आम्रेडित occurs in <i>Sutras</i> [[6.1.99]], [[7.1.57]], [[8.2.95]], (VIII. 10. 3) &c.

The तस्य here denotes <i>avayava</i>-<i>shashthi</i>: and the word परः denotes the <i>avayava</i>. In fact, this sutra<i> indicates by implication, that a Genitive case is employed, when a member (</i>avayava<i>) is denoted. So that the sentences like पूर्वं कायस्य become valid.

In the above examples, the word has become </i>pluta_ by [[8.2.95]].
