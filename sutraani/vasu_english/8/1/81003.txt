That which is called अम्रेडित (repeated) is gravely accented.
Thus भुङ्क्ते भु॒॒॒ङ्क्ते॒॒; पशून् प॒॒शू॒॒न् ॥

That is, all the vowels of the <i>amredita</i> become <i>anudatta</i> or accentless. In the above examples, the root भूञ् becomes <i>atmanepadi</i> by [[1.3.66]]: the Personal endings are <i>anudatta</i> by [[6.1.186]]; the <i>vikarana</i> शनम् gets the acute by [[3.1.3]]; the अ꣡ of this न꣡ is elided by [[6.4.111]], and thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ becomes finally acute by <i>udatta</i>-<i>nivrtti</i>-<i>svara</i> [[6.1.161]]. The <i>amredita</i> <i>bhunkte</i> becomes wholly <i>anudatta</i>. The word पशु is formed by the affix कु and is finally acute.
