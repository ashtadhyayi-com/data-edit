Whatever we shall teach hereafter should be understood to apply to that which comes after a <i>pada</i>. Thus the <i>sutra</i> [[8.1.19]], teaches "of an <i>amantrita</i>". The phrase पदात्, must be supplied to complete the sense. That is, "of a <i>pada</i>, which is in the Vocative case, and which comes after another <i>pada</i>, all vowels become <i>anudatta</i>". Thus पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त "Cookest thou, <i>O</i> <i>Devadatta</i>". Why do we say, "after a <i>pada</i>"? Observe देवदत्त पचसि ॥ Here <i>Devadatta</i> is not <i>anudatta</i> [[6.1.198]].
