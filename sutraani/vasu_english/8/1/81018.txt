The three words <i>anudattam</i> "unaccented ", <i>sarvam</i> "the whole", and <i>apadadau</i> "not in the beginning of a <i>Pada</i> of a verse", should be understood to exert a governing influence over all the subsequent <i>sutras</i> of this chapter, upto its end. Whatever we shall treat of hereafter, must be understood to be wholly unaccented, provided that, it does not stand as the first word of a verse or stanza. Thus [[8.1.19]], says "of a Vocative ". The whole of this <i>sutra</i> should be read there to complete the sense, viz: "all the syllables of a Vocative are unaccented when a word precedes it, and it does not stand as the first word of a hemistich"; as पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥

Why do we say "when not at the beginning of a hemistich"? Observe यत्ते नियतं रजसं मृत्यो अनवधृष्ण्यम्, here मृत्यो though in the Vocative case, is not <i>anudatta</i>, as it stands at the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>.

Similarly (VIII. I. 21), teaches "वः and नः are the substitutes of युष्मद् अस्मद् in the plural". The present <i>sutra</i> must be read there to complete the sense, viz, when not at the beginning of a verse. Thus ग्रामोवः स्वं, जनपदो नः स्वम् ॥ But at the beginning of a hemistich, we must have the forms युष्माकं and अस्माकं instead of वः and नः ॥ As,

रुद्रो विश्वेश्वरो देवो युष्माकं कुलदेवता ।
स एव नाथो भगवानस्माकं शत्रुमर्दनः ॥

The word पाद् in the <i>sutra</i> refers both to the hemistiches of the sacred <i>Rik</i> hymns, as well as to secular <i>slokas</i>.

Question: Why do we employ the word सर्वं in the <i>sutra</i>?

Answer:- The word <i>sarvam</i> is used in the <i>sutra</i>, in order to indicate that a word, which has not acute accent on the first syllable, should also become <i>anudatta</i>. For the word पदात् [[8.1.17]] is in the ablative case, and shows that the operation taught in any <i>sutra</i> governed by it, will be performed on the first syllable, according to the maxim आदेः परस्य ॥ Therefore, by rule [[8.1.28]], the word प꣡चति, which is acutely accented on the first syllable, (because शप् and तिप् are <i>anudatta</i>), will only lose its accent in देवदत्तः पचति; but not so the verb करोति which is acutely accented in the middle (by the <i>vikarana</i> accent) in देवदत्तः करोति ॥ But by force of the word सर्वं, करोति also loses its accent.

Question: This cannot be the reason, for the author indicates by his prohibition in <i>Sutra</i> [[8.1.29]], that a verb loses its accent, where ever that accent may be. For there is no verb when conjugated in लुट् which has acute on the first syllable.

Answer:- The word '<i>sarvam</i>' is used to prevent the operation of अलोऽन्त्यविधिः; for where the rule आदेः परस्य will not apply there the other will apply: so that, if "<i>sarvam</i>" was not used, the rule would apply to the finals, and not to cases where there were other than initials to be operated upon. Thus the rule [[8.1.28]] would apply to कुरुतः꣡ which is finally acute by [[6.1.186]], in देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तौ कु॒॒रु॒॒तः॒॒, but not to देवदत्तः करोति ॥

Question: No; this cannot be the reason of employing the word '<i>sarvam</i>' in the <i>sutra</i>, for the author indicates that the rule is not confined to the finals, by the prohibition he makes in favor of लृट् in [[8.1.51]]; for there is no verb, when conjugated in <i>Lrit</i>, which has acute on the final. All <i>Lrit</i> is acute in the middle by [[6.1.186]]. So the अलोऽन्त्यस्य rule does not apply.

Answer:- The word '<i>sarvam</i>:' is used for this reason. Had '<i>sarvam</i>', not been used, then in those cases where there was no other rule to apply, like [[8.1.19]], there only the word would become <i>anudatta</i>. But in cases where another rule also operated, there this <i>anudatta</i> rule would not apply, for then there would be two different sentences. For a thing which is already in existence can be made the subject of a rule ordering certain operations to be performed on it; but not so a thing which will come in existence in future time. Thus the words वां and नौ are ordained as substitutes of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> by one sentence [[8.1.20]]; while another sentence ordains their <i>anudatta</i>-hood. So here there is separation of sentences (<i>vakya</i>-<i>bheda</i>): which is not desireable; for a <i>vakya</i> <i>bheda</i> should be avoided, if possible. But by employing the word '<i>sarvam</i>:', this <i>vakya</i>-<i>bheda</i> is made tolerable.

Another reason for employing this word is that the substitutes वां and नौ should come in the room of the whole declined forms of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, with their case-affixes. Had not this word (<i>sarvam</i>) been used, then वां and नौ would have replaced only '<i>yushmad</i>' and '<i>asmad</i>'. Objection:- Will not the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word '<i>padasya</i>', cause the whole declined word to be replaced by वां and नौ, not only the crude-forms <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>? And there cannot be a full word unless it takes case-affixes; so the whole of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> with their case-affixes will be replaced. Where is the necessity of using the word '<i>sarvam</i>'? Answer:- This objection will apply to those cases where a <i>Pada</i> is a word ending in a case-affix. But the word पद is a technical term also, and applies to crude forms before certain case-affixes. Thus a nominal stem (not a full word) is also called <i>Pada</i> by [[1.4.17]], before non-<i>sarvanamasthana</i> case-affixes. Therefore <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> will be <i>pada</i> before those affixes. Thus before the affix of Dative Dual, they will be called <i>Pada</i>; and had सर्वं not been used, then only "<i>yushmad</i>" and "<i>asmad</i>" will be replaced and not their case-affixes. Thus ग्रामो वां दीयते, जनपदो नौ दीयते ॥ Here वां and नौ would require after them the case-affix भ्यां otherwise.
