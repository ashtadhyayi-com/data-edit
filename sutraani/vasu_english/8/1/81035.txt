In the छन्दस् (Vedas), the finite verb retains its accent (but not always) in connection with हि when it stands in correlation to another verb, even more than one.
That is sometimes one verb, sometimes more than one verb retain their accent. Thus of more than one verb, we have the following example :- अनृतं हि मत्तो व꣡दति । पाप्मा एनं वि पु꣡नाति 'Because the drunkard tells falsehood, therefore sin will make him impure: i. e. he does incur sin'. Here both verbs वदति and विपुनाति retain their accent: and हि has the force of यत् 'because'. According to <i>Kaiyyata</i> the meaning of this sentence is यस्मान् मत्तोऽनृतं वदति, तस्मादनृतवदन दोषेण न युज्यते i. e. a drunkard does not incur the sin of telling a falsehood, because he is not in his senses. See <i>Maitr</i>. <i>Sanhita</i> I.II.6. As regards one verb in a correlated sentence retaining its accent and the other losing it, we have:- अग्निर्हि पूर्वमुद꣡जयत् तमिन्द्रोऽमूद॒॒ज॒॒यत् ॥ Here the first retains its accent and the second not. The force of हि is to denote here cause and its effect. So also:- अजा ह्यग्नेर꣡जनिष्ट गर्भात् (or गर्भम्), सा वा अ॒॒प॒॒श्य॒॒त्॒॒ जनितारमग्रे (<i>Taittariya</i> <i>Samhita</i> IV. 2.10, 4). The word अजनिष्ट is first acute, the augment अट् having the accent; while अपश्यत् is all <i>anudatta</i>.
