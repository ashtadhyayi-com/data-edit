The finite verb retains its accent in connection with 1. तु 2. पश्य 3. पश्यत and 4. अह when meaning 'praise'.
Thus माणवकस्तु भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम्; पश्य माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनं, पश्यत माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम्, अह माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम् ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning praise'? Observe, पश्य मृगो धा॒॒व॒॒ति॒॒ ॥

The repetition of the word पूजायाम् here, though its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been supplied from [[8.1.37]], shows that the negation of that <i>sutra</i> does not extend here: for the पूजायाम् of that <i>sutra</i> is connected with two negatives, the म of that <i>sutra</i>, and the न of (VIII. I. 29), but the पूजायाम् of this <i>sutra</i> is connected with the general न of (VIII. I. 29) only.

Another example is आदह॑ स्व॒॒धामनु पुन॑र्गर्भ॒॒त्वमे॑रि॒॒रे ॥
