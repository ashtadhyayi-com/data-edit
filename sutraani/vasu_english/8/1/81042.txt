The word परीप्सा means त्वरा or 'quick'. Thus अधीष्व माणवक पुरा विद्यो꣡तते विद्युत्, or पुरा स्तनयति स्तनयित्नु ॥ The word पुरा here expresses the future occurrence which is imminent or very near at hand. It is against the rule of <i>Dharmasastras</i> to study while it thunders or lightens.

Why do we say 'when meaning haste'? Observe नडेन स्म पुराधी॒॒य॒॒ते॒॒ ॥ Here the word पुरा expresses a past time; that is, it means "long ago". So also ऊर्णया स्म पुराधीयते ॥ See [[3.2.118]] and [[3.2.122]], for the employment of पुर in the Past Tense, and [[3.3.4]], for the Present.
