When किम् is elided in asking a question relating to an action, the finite verb which is not preceded by a Preposition or a Negative Particle, optionally does not become <i>anudatta</i>. When is there the elision of this किम् because no rule of <i>Panini</i> has taught it? When the sense is that of an interrogation, but the word किम् is not used. In short, the word '<i>lopa</i>' here does not mean the Grammatical substitute, but merely non-use. As देवदत्तः प꣡चति (or प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒) आहोस्वित् प꣡ठति (or प॒॒ठ॒॒ति॒॒) Here the sentence is interrogative, even without the employment of किम् ॥ The option of this <i>sutra</i> is a <i>Prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, as it is connected with the sense of किम् ॥ The counter-examples are the same as in the last aphorism, but without किम् ॥
