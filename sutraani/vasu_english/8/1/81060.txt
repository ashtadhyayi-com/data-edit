In connection with ह , the first finite verb retains its accent when an offence against custom is reprimanded.
The word क्षिया means an error or mistake of duty, a breach of etiquette or a fault against good breeding.

Thus स्वयं ह रथेन या꣡ति॑ ३, उपाध्यायं पदाति ग॒॒म॒॒य॒॒ति॒॒ 'He himself goes on a car, while he causes his Preceptor to trudge behind on foot'. स्वयं ह ओदनं भुङ्क्ते ३, उपाध्यायं सक्तून् पाययति 'Himself eats the rice, and makes the preceptor eat the gruel'. Here in both examples, the <i>nighata</i> of the first verbs is prohibited. The verbs become <i>svarita</i>-<i>pluta</i> by [[8.2.104]].
