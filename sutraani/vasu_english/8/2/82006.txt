Thus सु + उत्थितः = सू꣡त्थितः or सू॑त्थितः; वि॑ + ईक्षते = वीक्ष꣡ते or वीक्ष॑ते; वसुकः + असि = वसुकोऽ॑सि or वसुकोऽ꣡सि ॥ Here the word सु is a <i>Karmapravachaniya</i>  by [[1.4.94]], when it is compounded by प्रादिसमास with the Past Participle, the <i>Avayayibhava</i> compound retains the accent of its first member [[6.2.2]], and so it is acutely accented on the first, and the rest are <i>anudatta</i>. Thus the <i>udatta</i> उ꣡ of सु is compounded with the <i>anudatta</i> उ॒॒ of उत्थितः which stands at the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>, and so the <i>ekadesa</i> is optionally <i>svarita</i>. In वीक्षते and वसुकोऽसि also the verbs ईक्षते and असि lose all accent by [[8.1.28]] and so ई and अ become <i>anudatta</i>, which when compounded with वि and वसुका become optionally <i>svarita</i>.

The word स्वरितः is employed in the <i>sutra</i> only for the sake of distinctness, for the <i>sutra</i> may have well stood as वाऽनुदात्ते पदादौ ॥ In this form of the <i>sutra</i>, the <i>udatta</i> of the preceding <i>sutra</i> would become optional when the second member is a word beginning with <i>anudatta</i>. <i>Udatta</i> being optional, in the other alternative, where there will not be <i>udatta</i>, the <i>svarita</i> will be substituted by reason of the nearness in position.

Why do we say "<i>anudatta</i> beginning"? Observe देवदत्तोऽत्र ॥ Here अत्र begins with <i>udatta</i> and not <i>anudatta</i>, and hence no option is allowed.

Why do we say "beginning of a word"? Observe वृक्षैः, वृक्षाः, प्लक्षैः and प्लक्षाः, where <i>anudatta</i> case-endings are not beginnings of words.

According to <i>Bhattoji</i> <i>Dikshita</i> this is a <i>vyavasthita</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>; in this wise. There will necessarily be <i>svarita</i> (1) where a long ई is the single substitute of (इ + इ) or of two short इ, (2) where there is <i>purva</i>-<i>rupa</i> by the application of एङपदान्तात् अति [[6.1.109]]. There will be <i>udatta</i> where a long vowel comes in. Thus in वि + इदम् = वीद॑म् in वी३दं॒॒ ज्योति॒॒र्हृद॑ये, the long ई is substituted for two short इ's. This substitution of a long ई for two short इ's is technically called प्रश्लेष ॥ Where there is <i>Praslesha</i>, the long ई is necessarily <i>svarita</i>. Similarly when there is अभिनिहतसन्धिः i. e. the peculiar <i>sandhi</i> taught in [[6.1.109]]. Thus ते॑ऽवदन्, सोऽय॒॒मागा॑त् ॥ So also where there is क्षैप्रः सन्धिः i.e. the substitution of a semi-vowel in the room of an <i>udatta</i> or <i>svarita</i> vowel, as अन्या॑भि ॥ The above rules about <i>svarita</i> are thus summarised in the <i>Pratisakhyas</i> : इकारयोश्च प्रश्लेषे क्षैप्राभिनिहतेषु च ॥ But where a long ई is substituted as a single substitute for इ + ई (one of the इ's being long), there it must always be acute. As अस्य श्लोको दि॒॒वीयते (<i>Rig</i>. 1. 190. 4). The words दिवि꣡ + ईय॒॒ते॒॒ are compounded into दिवीयते ॥ The word दिवि꣡ Locative singular is finally acute by [[6.1.171]]. ईयते is from the <i>Divadi</i> root इङ् गतौ, and has lost its accent by [[8.1.28]].
