The affixes तरप् and तमप् are called घ ॥ Thus सुपथिन् + तर = सुपथि + तर [[8.2.7]] = सुपथि + न्तर [[8.2.17]] = सुपथिन्तरः ॥ So also दस्युहन्तमः ॥

Vart:- The augment तुट् is added to these affixes after भूरिदावन्; as भूरिदावत्तरः ([[3.2.74]], the affix is वनिप्).

Vart:- Long ई is the substitute of the final of रथिन् before तर and तम ॥ The word रथिन् is formed by the affix इनि in the sense of मतुप् ॥ The final न् is first elided by [[8.2.7]], and then for the short इ of रथि the long ई is substituted by the present <i>vartika</i>. If the long ई were substituted for the final न् of रथिन् as रथिई + तर, then this long ई being <i>asiddha</i>, it could not be compounded by <i>ekadesa</i> with the preceding इ into ई, and the form would always remain रथिईतरः ॥ As रथीतरः, and रथीतमं रथीनाम् ॥ Or this ई may be considered to have come after रथ in the sense of मतुप् ॥
