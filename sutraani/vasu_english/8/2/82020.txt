Thus निजेगिल्यते, निजेगिल्येते, निजेगिल्यन्ते ॥ The root गॄ takes यङ्, when the sense of contempt is conveyed, with regard to the action denoted by the root, [[3.1.24]]. गर्हितं गिलति = जेगिल्यते ॥

Some say that ग्र of the <i>sutra</i> includes the two roots गॄ (गिरति <i>Tudadi</i> 117) and गॄ (गृणाति <i>Kryadi</i> 28). Others hold that the <i>Tudadi</i> <i>gri</i> is only taken and not the <i>Kryadi</i>. The <i>Kryadi</i> <i>gri</i> never takes the Intensive form, no example of which is to be met in literature.

Why do we say in the Intensive? Observe निगीर्यते with the Passive affix यक् ॥
