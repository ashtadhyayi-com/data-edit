Thus अक्षाः and अत्साः for अर्क्षास् and अत्सार्स् the Aorist of क्षर् and त्सर in the following passages : गोभिरक्षाः, प्रत्यञ्चमत्साः ॥ The ईट् is not added as a Vedic diversity. See [[7.3.97]].

So also मातुः, पितुः for मातुर्स् and पितुर्स् ॥ Here by (VI. I. 111), the ऋ + अ of मातृ + अस् is changed to उ, which is followed by र् by (I. I. 51).

Though the final स् would have been elided even after र् by [[8.2.23]], the special mention of स् after र् shows, that this is a <i>niyama</i> rule. So that any other letter than स् following after र् will not be dropped. Thus ऊर्क् from ऊर्ज् + क्विप् [[3.2.177]], here ज् is not elided, though final in a <i>pada</i>, but is changed to a guttural by [[8.2.30]], and to क् by [[8.4.56]]. Also अमार्ट् from मृज् in लङ् the तिप् (त्) is elided by [[6.3.18]]; there is <i>vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.114]], the ज् is changed to ष् by [[8.2.36]], which is changed to ड् [[8.4.53]] and finally to ट् (चर्) ॥
