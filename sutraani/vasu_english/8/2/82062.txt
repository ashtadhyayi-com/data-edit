The word पदस्य is understood here. The word क्विन्प्रत्यय is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> meaning 'that stem which has <i>kvin</i> as its affix.' For the final consonant of such a stem, a guttural is substituted. As घृतस्पृक् [[3.2.58]], हलस्पृक्, मन्त्रस्पृक् ॥

The <i>sutra</i> could have been क्विनः कुः; the word प्रत्यय is used in the <i>sutra</i> to show the <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound; so that the व् of क्विन् may not be changed to a guttural. Moreover this <i>Bahuvrihi</i> also indicates that the roots which take the क्विन् affix, change their final to a guttural before other affixes than क्विन् ॥ Thus the roots सृज् and दृश् take क्विन् to form स्रक् and दृक् nouns by [[3.2.59]], [[3.2.60]]. The guttural change will take place even when these roots are declined as verbs: as, मानो अस्राक् मानो अद्राक्, where अस्राक् and अद्राक् are the Aorist of सृज् and दृश् ॥ The augment अट् is not elided, though the मा is added [[6.4.75]] as a Vedic diversity. The ईट् augment also does not take place as a Vedic irregularity. The augment अम् is added by [[6.1.58]], and the vowel is lengthened by <i>Vriddhi</i> by [[7.2.3]]. Thus अट् + सृज् + सिच् + तिप् = अस्रज् [[6.1.58]] = अस्राक् [[7.2.3]] and [[8.2.62]]. Otherwise it would have been ष by [[8.2.36]]. So also in दृग्भ्यां, दृग्भिः, the श् is changed to a guttural, though the noun दृश् is a क्विप् formed noun and not formed by क्विन्; and this is so, because the verb दृश् does take क्विन् also.

Objection:- If this be so, there ought to be guttural change in रज्जुसृड्भ्यां from the root सृज् with क्विप्? Answer:- The guttural change however in not desired here.

In gutturalisation, ज is changed to ग, and श to ख, which both become क by वावसाने [[8.4.56]]
