Thus अग्निरत्र, वायुरत्र ॥ So also सजूर्ऋषिभिः, सजूर्देवेभिः ॥ सजुष् is derived from जुष् with the affix क्विप् and the preposition सह, which is changed to स in <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. The lengthening takes place by [[8.2.76]]. and the word means सप्रीतिः ॥ The रु is र्, but it should be distinguished from it. This secondary र् (or रु) undergoes a distinct and separate <i>Sandhi</i> change from that of the primary र् ॥
