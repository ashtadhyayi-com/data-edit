Thus अहर्ददाति, अहर्भुङ्क्ते ॥ Why do we say 'when no case-ending follows'? Observe अहोभ्याम्, अहोभिः ॥ Here रु-called र् replaced the final न् of अहन् ॥ The difference between this रु-called र and the ordinary र is illustrated in the above set of examples. The रु-called र is changed to उ by [[6.1.113]], the ordinary र is not so changed.

Objection:- In अहर्ददाति and अहर्भुङ्क्ते the case-ending is elided after अहन्, and so by <i>Pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i>, we may say that there is a case-ending here also ? Answer:- This is not so, because of the following maxim अहो रविधौ लुमता लुप्ते प्रत्यय लक्षणं न भवति ॥ The rule of <i>pratya</i> <i>lakshana</i> does not apply to the substitution of र for the final of अहन् when the affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्. Therefore, this अहन् is not considered to be followed by सुप् or case-affix. But where an affix is elided by using the word लोप, there the rule of <i>Pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i> does apply to अहन् ॥ As हे दीर्घाहोऽत्र, हे दीर्घाहो निदाघ. [[8.2.7]]. Here the affix is elided by using the word '<i>lopa</i>' by [[6.1.68]].
