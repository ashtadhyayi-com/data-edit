This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>. All the three words i.e. "the last vowel (टि) of a sentence", "<i>pluta</i>" and "acute" - are to be supplied in the subsequent aphorisms to complete the sense, upto the end of this <i>Pada</i>. Whatever we shall treat hereafter will refer to the final vowel (टि) in a sentence, and it will get the <i>pluta</i> lengthening and acute accent. Thus [[8.2.83]], says "In answer to a salutation, but not when it is addressed to a <i>Sudra</i>". We must supply the present aphorism to complete the meaning :-"In answer to a salutation, the last vowel of a sentence becomes <i>pluta</i> and gets the acute accent, but not when it is addressed to a <i>Sudra</i>". As अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं । भो आयुष्मानेधि देवदत्ता꣡ ३ ॥

One <i>adhikara</i> sets aside another <i>adhikara</i>, this is the general maxim. Will therefore the <i>adhikara</i> of the present aphorism set aside the <i>adhikara</i> of the word पदस्य [[8.1.16]]? No, the <i>adhikara</i> of पदस्य has not ceased, though latent. Otherwise in भवन्तौ &c. the न् would be required to be changed to रु by [[8.3.7]]. But it does not become so, because पदस्य manifests itself there.

The employment of the word "<i>vakya</i>" would not debar the <i>anuvritti</i> of पद, for the final vowel of a sentence, will a fortiori be the final vowel of a word (<i>pada</i>), then what is the use of employing the word वाक्यस्य in this <i>sutra</i> ?

The word वाक्य is employed in the <i>sutra</i>, so that a word which is not the last word of a sentence, will not get the <i>pluta</i> and acute. Had the <i>sutra</i> been पदस्य टेः &c. then all the words of a sentence would become <i>pluta</i> and acute in the final. The word टि is employed to indicate that the final vowel becomes <i>pluta</i> and acute, though the word may end in a consonant. As अग्निचि꣡३त् ॥ Had टि not been used, the rule would have applied to words ending in vowels only, and not to words ending in consonants.
