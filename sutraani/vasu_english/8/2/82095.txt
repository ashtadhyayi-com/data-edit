A Vocative is reiterated when threat is meant [[8.1.8]]. Its final syllable becomes <i>pluta</i>. Thus चौर꣡ चौरा꣡३ घातिष्यामि त्वा ॥ So also वृषल वृषला꣡३ बन्धयिष्यामि त्वा, दस्य दस्यो३ &c.

Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of the <i>sutra</i> [[8.2.82]], is current here, yet the final of the sentence is not <i>pluta</i>, but of the <i>amredita</i>.

Vart:- It should be rather stated that any one of the repeated words may be <i>pluta</i> by alternation. Thus चौरा꣡३ चौर or चौर꣡ चौरा꣡३ ॥ The word <i>amredita</i> is employed in the <i>sutra</i> as illustrative of the doubling, for threat is expressed by both words, so <i>pluta</i> may be of both words in turn: and not of the second word only, though that is called technically <i>amredita</i>.
