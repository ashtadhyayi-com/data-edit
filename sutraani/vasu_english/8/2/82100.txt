That which is employed at the end of an interrogative sentence is called प्रश्नान्तः ॥ According to some, this rule does not ordain <i>pluta</i>, but only ordains the <i>anudatta</i>-ness of those syllables which become <i>pluta</i> by the previous rules [[8.2.84]] &c. The meaning of the <i>sutra</i> then is:- That <i>pluta</i> which comes at the end of an Interrogative sentence or a sentence denoting admiration, is <i>anudatta</i>.

Thus अगमा꣡३ : पूर्वा꣡३म् ग्रामा꣡३न् अग्निभूता॒॒३इ or अगम॑३: पूर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् पटा॒॒३उ (i.e. अगमः पूर्वान् ग्रामान् अग्निभूते or पटो) ॥ The words अग्निभूते, and पटो being finals in a question, become <i>anudatta</i> as well as <i>pluta</i>. The other words अगमः &c become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i> by [[8.2.105]]. See (VIII 2. 107).

As regards अभिपूजिते we have शोभनः खल्वसि माणवका॒॒ ३ ॥  Here the final of माणवक becomes <i>anudatta</i> and <i>pluta</i>.
