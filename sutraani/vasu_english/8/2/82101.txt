The end vowel at the end of a sentence becomes अनुदात्त and प्लुत when the particle चित् is used, denoting comparison.
The word अनुदात्तं is understood here. This <i>sutra</i> ordains <i>pluta</i> as well and not merely accent.

Thus अग्निचिद् भाया॒॒३त् 'may he shine as fire'. So also राजचिद् भाया॒॒३त् 'may be shine as a King'.  

Why do we say 'when the sense is that of comparison'? Observe कथं चिद् आहुः ॥ Here चिद् has the force of 'littleness or difficulty'.

Why do we say प्रयुज्यमाने 'when expressly employed'? Observe अग्नि र्माणवको भायात् 'Let the boy shine like fire'. Here चित् is understood, hence the rule does not apply.
