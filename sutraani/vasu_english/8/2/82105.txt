The word '<i>padasya</i>' is understood here: and so also the word '<i>svarita</i>'. The end-vowel of a word which is not the last word in a sentence, as well as of the last word, becomes <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i>, when a question is asked, or a fact is narrated. In fact, all the words of a sentence become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i> hereby.

Thus in questioning we have:- आगमा॑३: पूर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् अग्नि भूतां॑३इ or पटा३उ ॥ Thus all words have become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i>. The final word would, in one alternative, become <i>anudatta</i> also, by [[8.2.100]], as shown under that <i>sutra</i>. The force of the word अपि in the <i>sutra</i>, is to make the final word also <i>svarita</i>, and thus this <i>sutra</i> makes [[8.2.100]] an optional <i>sutra</i> with regard to question.

In <i>akhyana</i> or narration, there is no other rule, which is debarred by this. Therefore there, all words become <i>svarita</i> and <i>pluta</i> necessarily, by the force of this <i>sutra</i>. Thus अगमा॑३न् पुर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् भोः॑३ ॥

Another view of this <i>sutra</i> is that the word अपि applies only to <i>akhyana</i>, so that in <i>akhyana</i> all words become <i>svarita</i>. But in <i>prasna</i>, the final word will not become <i>svarita</i>, but <i>anudatta</i> necessarily by [[8.2.100]]. According to this view, this <i>sutra</i> does not ordain option. This view is not adopted by <i>Kasika</i>, or <i>Padamanjari</i> or <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>.
