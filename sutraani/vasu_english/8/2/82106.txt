The <i>pluta</i> ordained by [[8.2.84]] &c. when applied to ऐ or औ, cause the prolation of the last element of these diphthongs namely of इ or उ ॥ The word प्लुतौ in the <i>sutra</i> is Nominative dual of प्लुत, and the aphorism literally means "इ and उ are <i>pluta</i> of the diphthongs ऐ and औ" ॥

Thus ऐ३तिकायन, औ३पगव ॥

The letters ऐ and औ are compound letters or diphthongs consisting of अ + इ and अ + उ ॥ In making the <i>pluta</i> of these, the question arises, should both अ and इ (or उ) be prolated, or only the last element, or the first only. The present <i>sutra</i> answers that doubt. If in the analysis of these letters, अ be taken as having one <i>matra</i> (or moras), and इ and उ one <i>matra</i>, then the <i>pluta</i> इ and उ will have two <i>matras</i>, so that the whole <i>pluta</i> ऐ and औ will have three <i>matras</i>. In fact, the word प्लुत is used here as a Past Participle of प्लु, having the force of a verb; and इदुतौ प्लुतौ means इदुतौ प्लवेते i.e. वृद्धिं गच्छतः, i.e. इ and उ are lengthened. And इ and उ are lengthened to that extent, so as to make ऐ and औ of three <i>matras</i>. Thus when अ + इ and अ +  उ each has one <i>matra</i>, then the <i>pluta</i> of इ and उ will have two <i>matras</i> as we have said before. But when अ + इ (ए) and अ + उ (ओ) are considered to have अ half <i>matra</i>, and इ and उ one <i>matra</i> and a half, then इ and उ are made <i>pluta</i>, so as to have two and a half (2 1/2)<i>matras</i> each, thus the whole of ऐ and औ, has still three <i>matras</i>. In fact, the definition of <i>pluta</i> is, that it is a vowel which has three <i>matras</i>: so that we should so prolate the vowel as to make it have three <i>matras</i>.

But according to <i>Patanjali</i>, this <i>pluta</i> of ऐ and औ has four <i>matras</i>. Thus अ + इ and अ + उ each has one <i>matra</i>. The <i>pluta</i> of इ and उ will have three <i>matras</i>. Thus अ + इ३ and अ + उ३. or the whole has four <i>matras</i>. According to this view a vowel may have four <i>matras</i> also.
