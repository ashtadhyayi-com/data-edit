Thus पुँस्कामा or पुंस्कामा; पुँस्पुत्रः or पुंस्पुत्रः; पुँस्फलं or पुंस्फलम्; पुँश्चली or पुंश्चली ॥ The <i>visarga</i> in पुंस्कामा required to be changed optionally to ᳶ <i>jihva</i>-<i>muliya</i> by [[8.3.37]], but it is not so done. It is changed always to स् here by [[8.3.34]], also. The स् of पुंस् is dropped by [[8.2.23]], and the preceding sound is म, which comes to light in forms like पुमान् &c. For the sake of distinctness, <i>Panini</i> has elected to exhibit the shorter form पुम् when in the beginning of a composition : because this shorter form पुम् is the real stem in composition.  खय् <i>pratyahara</i> includes the ten hard consonants, and अम् <i>pratyahara</i> includes all vowels, semivowels and nasals. पुंस्कामा is formed by the affix ण = पुमांसं कामयते ॥

In that alternative when we read the preceding <i>sutra</i> as समः स्सुटि, then the <i>anuvritti</i> of this स् will be current in the present sutra<i> also, and so there will be no scope for the operation of [[8.3.37]]. And though the </i>anuvritti<i> of रु is also current, yet it will not apply here, because of its non-appropriateness in that alternative.

Why do we say 'before a surd mute'? Observe पुंदासः, पुंगवः [[5.4.92]]. Why do we say 'followed by a vowel or semivowel or nasal'? Observe पुंक्षीरः, पुंक्षुरः ॥ Why do we use the word परे in the </i>sutra<i>? Had we not used it, the </i>sutra_ might have been open to this construction also. The म् of पुम् is so changed before a खय् letter which has an अम् letter, (whether preceding it or following it). So that the rule would have applied to पुमाख्यः, पुमाचारः ॥
