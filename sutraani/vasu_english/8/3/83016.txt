Thus पयःसु, सर्प्पिःषु, यशःसु ॥ The word सुप् is here the Locative Plural affix. Though the र् would have been changed to <i>visarga</i> by the last <i>sutra</i> also; the making of this a special <i>sutra</i> is for the sake of <i>niyama</i>. That is, only रु becomes <i>visarga</i>, and not any other र् ॥ Thus गीर्षु, भूर्षु, when the र् is not रु ॥ In पयस् &c, the स् becomes रु by [[8.2.66]].
