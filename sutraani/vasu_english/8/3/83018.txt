That the effort in pronouncing which is very light is called <i>laghu</i>-<i>prayatna</i>-<i>tara</i>. Effort or articulation is a quality of the person who utters and which is the cause of the utterance of a letter. व् and य् of lighter articulation are substituted for the final व् and य् in भोय्, भगोय्, अघोय्, or after an अ or आ ॥ The lighter व् will replace the heavy व्, and so the lighter य् the heavy य् ॥

Thus भोयत्र, भगोयत्र, अघोयत्र, कयास्ते or क आस्ते, अस्मायुद्धर or अस्मा उद्धर, असावादित्यः or असा आदित्यः, द्वावत्र, or द्वा अत्र, द्वावानय or द्वा आनय ॥

The lighter articulation results from the relaxation of the muscles and the organs employed in speech. The places of pronunciation are palate &c, the organs are the root, the middle and the tip of the tongue. When the contact of the tongue with the various places is very light, the articulation is <i>laghu</i> <i>prayatna</i>-<i>tara</i>. In fact, य् and व् are to be slurred over.
