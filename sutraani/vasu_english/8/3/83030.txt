Thus भवान् त्साये, महान् त्साये or भवान् साये, महान् साये ॥ The ध् of the augment becomes त् by [[8.4.55]]. This त् is <i>asiddha</i> [[8.2.1]], and therefore त् is not changed to रु by [[8.3.7]]. This is the reason why the augment is exhibited as धुट् and not तुट् ॥ In <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.29]] तुट् would have done as well but not so here. This view of the <i>Kasika</i>, however, is not approved by <i>Padamanjari</i>. The न् can never be changed to रु here, because त् is followed by स् which is not an अम् letter. The word अम्परे is understood in [[8.3.7]]. In fact, तुट् would have been a better augment.
