व् is optionally the substitute of the Particle उ when it is preceded by मय् consonant (all consonants with the exception of the semi-vowels, sibilants, ह and ञ) and is followed by a vowel.
Thus शमु अस्तु वेदिः or शम्वस्तु वेदिः, तद् उ अस्य रेतः or तद्वस्य रेतः, किम् उ आवपनम् or किम्वावपनम् ॥ The उ is a <i>Pragrihya</i> by [[1.1.14]], and therefore would have remained unchanged, this ordains व् optionally. This व being considered <i>asiddha</i>, the म् is not changed to <i>anusvara</i> in किम्वावपनम्, शम्वस्तु &c, by [[8.3.23]].

When this उ is followed by इति, and preceded by a मय् consonant, then by (I. I. 17), it is optionally प्रगृह्य, and it may be replaced by ऊँ ॥ When it is not a <i>pragrihya</i>, then it is changed to व् by यणादेश (VI. I. 77), or to व् by the present <i>sutra</i>. In the case of यणादेश व्, there is <i>anusvara</i> by [[8.3.23]], as किंविति ॥ When it is a <i>Pragrihya</i>, then it is changed to व् by the present <i>sutra</i> as किम्विति or किमु इति ॥ So also with ऊँ substitute, where the व्ँ will be nasal : as किम्विँति, or ऊँ will remain unchanged, as किम् ऊँ इति ॥ Thus we have five forms with इति ॥
