The सिवादि are the four roots सिव् सह, स्तु and स्वञ्ज, as well as the augment सुट् ॥ This is an example of <i>ubhayatra</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>. In the case of स्तु and स्वञ्ज् it is <i>prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, in the case of others it is <i>aprapta</i>. The examples have already been given under the preceding <i>sutra</i>, and so need not be repeated here.
