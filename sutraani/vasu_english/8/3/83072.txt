The root स्यन्दू प्रस्रवणे is <i>anudatta</i>. Thus अनुष्यन्दते । विष्यन्दते । परिष्यन्दते । अभिष्यन्दते तैलम् । निष्यन्दते । अनुस्यन्दते । विस्यन्दते । परिस्यन्दते ।

Why do we say 'when the subject is not a living being'? Observe अनुस्यन्दते मत्स्य उदके ॥ The option of this <i>sutra</i> will apply, when the subject is a compound of living and non-living beings. Thus अनुस्यन्देते or अनुष्यन्देते मत्स्योदके ॥ The subject here is a <i>Dvandva</i> compound, and it is not in the singular number because of [[2.4.6]]. The word अप्राणिषु is a <i>Paryudasa</i> and not a <i>Prasajya</i>-<i>pratishedha</i>. If it be the latter sort of prohibition, then the force will be on the word living, and in a compound like मत्स्योदके, consisting of living and non-living beings, the prohibition will apply because it has a living being in it, and so there will be no षत्व ॥ In the other view, the force is on the word non-living, and because the compound contains a non-living being, therefore the option will be applied, and the presence of the living being along with it will be ignored.

The <i>anuvritti</i> of परि, नि and वि is understood here from [[8.3.70]]. So these words could well have been omitted from the <i>sutra</i>, which might have then been अन्वभिभ्यांच स्यन्दतेरप्राणिषु, and by the force of च we would draw in the <i>anuvritti</i> of परि &c.
