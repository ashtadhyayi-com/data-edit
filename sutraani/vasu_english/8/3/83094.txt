By <i>Sutra</i> [[3.3.34]] the word विष्टार is formed denoting a sort of metre called विष्टारपंक्तिः ॥

Why do we say when denoting 'the name of a <i>chhandas</i>'? Observe पटस्य विस्तारः ॥

In fact this <i>sutra</i> makes unnecessary the <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.34]]. To avoid this difficulty, some say that the <i>sutra</i> [[3.3.34]] is not confined to the preposition वि, so that we can form प्रस्तारपङ्क्तिः संसारपङ्क्ति ॥
