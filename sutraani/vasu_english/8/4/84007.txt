Thus पूर्वाह्णः "fore-noon"; अपराह्णः "after-noon".

Why do we say "ending in अ"? Observe, निरह्नः, दुरह्नः ॥

The word अह्न is substituted for अहन् by [[5.4.88]]. The word अह्न being used in the <i>sutra</i> as ending in अ, the rule does not apply to other words. Thus दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥ The word अह्नः in the <i>sutra</i> is in the nominative case, and should not be construed as the genitive of अहन्, because all <i>sthanins</i> are exhibited in Nominatives as, वनं [[8.4.4]], वाहनं [[8.4.8]], यानं &c. The compounding takes place by [[2.2.1]], then is added the <i>samasanta</i> affix टच् [[5.4.91]], and अह्न substitution by [[5.4.88]]. The word दीर्घाह्नी is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound and not a <i>Tatpurusha</i>, and hence the affix टच् does not apply to it. The feminine ङीप् is added by [[4.1.28]], there is elision of अ of अहन् by [[6.4.134]].
