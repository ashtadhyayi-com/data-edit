Thus इक्षुवाहणम् 'a sugar-cart'. शरवाहणम् "a reed-cart". दर्भवाहणम् 'a hay-cart'.

The thing which being placed on a cart is carried, is called आहित ॥

Why do we say "denoting the thing carried". Observe दाक्षिवाहणम् "a vehicle belonging to <i>Dakshi</i>".

The word वाहन is formed by adding ल्युट् to वह्, and lengthening of the penultimate is valid by the <i>nipatana</i> of this <i>sutra</i>.
