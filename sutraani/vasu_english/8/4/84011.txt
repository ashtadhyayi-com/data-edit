Thus, to take the case a प्रातिपदिकान्त first. माषवापिणौ or माषवापिनौ from माषवापिन् '<i>masha</i>-sowing' formed by णिनि under [[3.2.81]].

To take the example of a नुम् augment माषवापाणि or माषवापानि, व्रीहिवापाणि or व्रीहिवापानि nominative plural neuter. The augment नुम् is here added by [[7.1.72]] from माषान् वपयन्ति = माषवाप with कर्मणि अण्, the plural शि is added by [[7.1.20]], and then नुम् ॥

To take the विभक्ति or case-termination, माषवापेण or माषवापेन, व्रीहिवापेण or व्रीहिवापेन ॥

The word प्रातिपदिकान्त means 'final in a <i>Pratipadika</i>'. But here it means 'final in a <i>pratipadika</i> which is a second member, of compound, the first member containing the cause of change'. Therefore the change does not take place in गर्गाणां भगिनी = गर्गभगिनी "the sister of <i>Garga</i>". But गर्गभगिणी if the word is derived from गर्गभगः 'the share of <i>Garga</i>', with the adjectival affix इन्, feminine इनी, meaning, "enjoying the share of <i>Garga</i>." In this case, like the word मातृभोगीणः 'fit to be possessed by a mother': the change will invariably take place.

The word माषवापिणि or ०नी is to be understood to have a final न्, the affix being added afterwards in accordance with the following maxim :- [[2.2.19]]. "It should be stated that <i>Gatis</i>, <i>Karakas</i>, and <i>Upapadas</i> are compounded with bases that end with <i>krit</i>-affixes, before a case termination or a feminine affix has been added to the latter" गतिकारकोपपदानां कृद्भिः सह समासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः ॥

Therefore the composition takes place first with the word ending in the <i>krit</i> affix, as माषवापिन् (माष + वापिन्), and thus the second term वापिन् is a <i>Pratipadika</i> which ends in न्, and so the rule is applied to it, when the feminine affix is added.

Similarly नुम् is not considered as the end portion of the second member of the compound, but as the end-portion of the full compound word.

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated of the words युवा &c. As आर्ययूना [[6.4.133]] vocalisation), क्षत्रिययूना ॥ प्रपक्वानि is a <i>gati</i>-<i>samas</i>, दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥
