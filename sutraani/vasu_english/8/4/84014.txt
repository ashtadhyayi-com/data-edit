The word णोपदेश means a root which is enunciated in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> with an initial ण ॥ Thus प्रणमति 'he bows'. परिणमति, प्रणायकः 'a leader' परिणायकः &c.

Why do we say "after an <i>Upasarga</i>"? Observe प्रनायकः = प्रगता नायका अस्माद् देशात् 'a country without a leader'. Here the word प्र is not an <i>upasarga</i>, but a mere <i>nipata</i>. See [[1.4.57]], [[1.4.58]] and [[1.4.59]]. In fact, प्र is <i>upasarga</i> here with regard to गत understood, and not with regard to नी ॥

Why do we say "even when it is not a compound?" Because by context, the <i>anuvritti</i> of the word पूर्वपद, which is current throughout this subdivision, would have been understood in this <i>sutra</i> also, and the rule would have applied to <i>samasas</i> only, for there only we have <i>purvapada</i>. By using the word असमासे it is shown that the <i>adhikara</i> of <i>purvapada</i> ceases, and the rule applies to non-compounds also where there is no पूर्वपद ॥

Why do we say "having ण in <i>Upadesa</i>"? Observe प्रनर्दति, प्रनर्दितुम्, प्रनर्दकः ॥ For the root नर्द is recited in <i>Dhatupatha</i> with न ॥ There are eight such roots नर्द्, नाट्, नाथ्, नाध्, नन्द्, नक्क्, नॄ, नृत् ॥ See [[6.1.65]].
