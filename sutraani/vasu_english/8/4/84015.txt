Thus प्रहिणोति, प्रहिणुतः, प्रमीणाति, प्रमीणीतः ॥ The root हि belongs to <i>Svadi</i> class of verbs and takes the <i>vikarana</i> नु technically श्नु; and the root मी belongs to <i>Kryadi</i> class which takes the <i>vikarana</i> श्ना ॥ In the <i>sutra</i> the verbs are shown with the <i>vikaranas</i> affixed. Under certain circumstances the forms of the <i>vikarana</i> is changed from नु to नो and ना to नी, but the rule still applies, because the substitute of an अच् or vowel is like the principal. See (l. I. 57).
