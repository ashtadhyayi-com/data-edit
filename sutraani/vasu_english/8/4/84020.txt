As हे प्राण् ! हे पराण् ! This rule is an exception to [[8.4.37]] sub, by which final न् in a <i>pada</i> is not changed into ण ॥ The word अन्तः in the <i>sutra</i> is to be understood to be equivalent to पदान्तः, and the rule applies when the word is in the vocative case.

According to some अन्तः is taken to be a part of the last <i>sutra</i>, and has the meaning of 'proximity'. That is the न is changed to ण, if the र is not separated from the न् by more than one letter. Therefore there is no change in परि + अनिति = पर्यनिति ॥ In this view, another अन्त should be taken for the sake of final न्, in हे प्राण् ॥

According to others the form पर्यणिति is valid, and they do not connect अन्तः with the last <i>sutra</i>.

The word प्राण् is a क्विप् formed word, and the न् final is not elided in the Vocative Singular because of the prohibition of [[8.2.8]]; in every other place, when the न् is <i>padanta</i>, it would be dropped; and therefore the illustration is given with Vocative singular, which alone satisfies the requirements of this <i>sutra</i>.
