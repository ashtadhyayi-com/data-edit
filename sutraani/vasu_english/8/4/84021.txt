Thus in the Desiderative प्राणिणिषति and Aorist of the Causative प्राणिणत्, and so also पराणिणिषति and पराणिणत् ॥

If the maxim पूर्वत्रासिद्धीयमद्विर्वचने be applied here; then we have the following dilemma in, प्रानि + स + ति ॥ Here the affix सन् requires reduplication, and the present <i>sutra</i> requires ण change of न ॥ The णत्व being <i>asiddha</i>, the reduplication being made first, we have प्राणिनि + स + ति, and then the reduplicate ण intervenes between the cause प्र and the root- न् of नि, and so this न would not be changed to ण ॥ If however the above maxim be applied, we first apply the णत्व rule, as प्राणि + स + ति, and then reduplicate णि; and we get the form प्राणिणिषति even without this <i>sutra</i>.

If we could get this form by the application of the above maxim, where is the necessity of the present <i>sutra</i>? The <i>sutra</i> is necessary in order to indicate that the above maxim is <i>anitya</i> or not of universal application. And because it is <i>anitya</i>, that the form औजढत् is evolved by reduplicating हत् (See [[8.2.1]]).
