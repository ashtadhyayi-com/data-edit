Thus अन्तर्हण्यते and अन्तर्हणनं ॥

Why do we say "when not meaning a country अदेश?" Observe अन्तर्हननी देशः ॥

The phrase अत्पूर्वस्य "preceded by short अ" of <i>sutra</i> 22 <i>ante</i>, is to be read into this <i>sutra</i> also. Observe, अन्तर्घ्नन्ति ॥

Why do we say "short अ?" See, अन्तरघानि ॥ The word <i>antar</i> is an <i>upasarga</i> for the purposes of ण change, by the <i>vartika</i> under (l. 4. 65); therefore, it would have caused the ण change by [[8.4.22]]. The present <i>sutra</i> is made, to show that the change takes place only then, when it does not mean a country.
