In the छन्दस् , the न of (the Pronoun) नस् is changed into ण , when it comes after a root having a र or ष or after the words उरु and षु (सु)।
Thus अग्ने रक्षाणः (<i>Rig</i> VII. 15. 13). '<i>O</i> <i>Agni</i> protect us'. शिक्षा णो अस्मिन् (<i>Rig</i>. VII. 32. 26) 'Teach us this'. उरु :- उरुणस्कृधि (<i>Rig</i>. VIII. 75. 11) षु — अभीषुणः सखीनाम् (<i>Rig</i> IV. 31. 3). ऊर्ध्व ऊषुणः ऊतये (<i>Rig</i>. I. 36. 13).

The word नस् is here the pronoun नस्, which is the substitute, in certain cases, of अस्मद् [[8.1.21]] and does not mean here the नस् substitute of नासिका ॥ In the next <i>sutra</i>, however, both नस् are taken. धातुस्थ means 'that which exists in a <i>dhatu</i>', namely र् and ष् when occurring in a root. The word उरु means the word-form उरु; and षु means सुञ्, and is exhibited with ष-change. It does not mean the affix सु of the Locative Plural. Therefore, not here इन्द्रो धता गृहेषु नः ॥ The word रक्षा is the 2rd Person singular, Imperative, the lengthening is by [[6.3.135]]. The root शिक्ष् has the sense of दान in the <i>Veda</i>. कृधी is 2nd Person singular Imperative of कृ [[6.4.102]], the <i>visarga</i> of नः is changed to स् by [[8.3.50]]. In अभीषु there is lengthening by [[6.3.134]]: so also in ऊषुणः &c.
