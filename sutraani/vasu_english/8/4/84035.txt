After a ष् final in a पद , the न् is not changed to ण।
Thus निष्पानम्, दुष्पानम्; the <i>visarga</i> is changed to ष् here by [[8.3.41]]. The rule [[8.4.29]] is debarred. सर्पिष्पानम् (is a genitive compound contra [[2.2.14]]). So also यजुष्पानम् [[2.1.32]]. The ष is in these two by [[8.3.45]], and [[8.4.10]] is debarred.

Why do we say "षात् after a ष्?" Observe निर्णयः ॥

Why do we say पदान्तात् 'final in a <i>Pada</i>'? Observe कुष्णाति, पुष्णाति ॥ The word पदान्त is equivalent to पदे अन्त or Locative <i>Tatpurusha</i>; and does not mean final of a <i>Pada</i>. Therefore the rule does not apply here. सुसर्पिष्केण (instrumental singular) सुयजुष्केण ॥ Here the क is added by [[5.4.154]]. शोभनं सर्पिरस्य = सुसर्पिष्क (a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>). The ष is by [[8.3.39]]. Before the affix क, the word सुसर्पिस् is a <i>Pada</i> (1. 4. 17), and thus स् (ष्) is final of a <i>Pada</i>: but it is not final of a preceding member followed by another <i>Pada</i>. The rule, in fact, applies to compounds, the ष् being final in the first term.
