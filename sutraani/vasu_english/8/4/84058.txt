Thus शङ्किता, शङ्कितुम्, शङ्कितव्यम्, उञ्छिता, कुण्डिता, नन्दिता, कम्पिता &c. These are from roots शकि शङ्कायाम्, उञ्छि उञ्छे, कुदिदाहे, टुनदि समृद्धौ, कपि चलने ॥ Here नुम् is added because they are उदित्, and this न् becomes <i>anusvara</i> by [[8.3.24]], and this <i>anusvara</i> is changed to ङ् when followed by a guttural क् &c, to ञ् when followed by a palatal च &c, and so on to ण्, न् and म् ॥

Why do we say 'when यय् follows'? Observe आक्रंस्यते, आचिक्रंस्यते ॥

In कुर्वन्ति, वृषन्ति, the न is not changed into ण, though required by [[8.4.2]]. Because the णत्व is <i>asiddha</i>, and therefore by the prior rule [[8.3.24]], the न is first changed into <i>anusvara</i> [[8.2.1]]. That <i>anusvara</i> is again changed into न by the present rule, न being homogeneous with त ॥ This change again being असिद्ध as if it had never taken place [[8.2.1]], the ण is never substituted for न ॥
