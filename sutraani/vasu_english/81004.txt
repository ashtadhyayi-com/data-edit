The whole word is अम्रेडित (repeated) when the sense is of 'always' and 'each'.
What words express 'always'? The finite verbs, and the Indeclinable words, formed by <i>krit</i> affixes. What 'always' is meant here? The word '<i>nitya</i>' here means 'again and again', and this idea of 'repetition' is the quality of an action. That action which the agent does principally, without cessation, is called "<i>nitya</i>". So that <i>nitya</i> refers to an action (See [[3.4.22]]). Thus पचति पचति 'he cooks continually'. जल्पति जल्पति 'he talks incessantly'. भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति or भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'each one, when he has eaten goes away.' See [[3.4.22]]. लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति (See III.4.2). The affixes <i>ktva</i> and <i>namul</i> formed words and the Imperative mood express the idea of 'again and again', only when they are repeated. While the words formed with the affix यङ् (Intensive) express this idea by the inherent force of the affix, without repetition. Thus पुनः पुनः पचति = पापच्यते ॥ And when this intensive action is continually done, then this word also should be repeated; as पापच्यते पापच्यते ॥ In the above, examples have been given of <i>nitya</i>, as illustrated by finite verbs like पचति, Indeclinable <i>krit</i> words like भुक्त्वा, and like भोजं ॥ Now for वीप्सा ॥ In what words the वीप्सा is found ? It is found in nouns (सुप् formed words). As finite verbs (तिङ्) express <i>nitya</i>, so inflected nouns (सुप्) express <i>vipsa</i> or a distributive sense. What is meant by the word <i>vipsa</i>? It is the wish of the agent to pervade (<i>vyaptum</i> <i>ichchha</i>) an object through and through with a certain quality or action. That is, when many objects are wished to be pervaded by the speaker, with a particular attribute or action simultaneously, it is <i>vipsa</i>. Thus ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'. So also जनपदो जनपदो रमणीयः पुरुषः पुरुषो निधनमुपैति ॥

When a finite verb is repeated owing to the idea of <i>nityata</i>; and we also wish to add to such a verb the affix denoting comparative or superlative degree, such affix must be added after the word has been repeated, as पचति पचतितराम् ॥ But in the case of a noun, which is repeated owing to <i>vipsa</i>, the whole superlative or comparative word should be repeated, as आढ्यतरमाढ्यतरमानय ॥
