When एक is repeated, it is treated like a member of a बहुव्रीहि समास ।
The making it a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> is for the sake of eliding the case-affix, and treating the word as a masculine, even when it refers to a feminine. Thus ए꣡कैकमक्षरं पठति (not एकमेकम्), ए꣡कैकयाहुत्या जुहोति (not एकयैकया). The accent is regulated by [[6.2.1]]. the case-affix is elided by [[2.4.71]], and masculinising by [[6.3.34]]. This double word एकैक should not however be treated like a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> for the purposes of the application of the following three rules, (1) The <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]] by which pronouns are not declined as pronouns when members of a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compound. The word एकैक however is declined like a Pronoun, as एकैकस्मै ॥ For <i>sutra</i> [[1.1.29]] applies to a compound which is really a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, and not to a word-form which is treated like a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>. The repetition of the word <i>Bahuvrihi</i> in that <i>sutra</i>, though its <i>anuvritti</i> was understood from the preceding one; indicates this. (2) The application of the rule of accent. Thus by the following <i>sutra</i>, a word is repeated when a mental pain or affliction over something is expressed. Thus न न करोति, सुसुजागर्ति ॥ This double-word is treated like a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, but not for the purposes of accent. For by [[6.2.172]] a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> preceded by न or सु gets acute on the final, but not so नन or सुसु ॥ Here four rules of accent present themselves Ist [[6.1.223]] ordaining acute on the final, 2nd [[6.2.1]] the first member retaining its accent, 3rd [[6.2.172]] already mentioned, 4th [[8.1.3]] by which the second member becomes <i>anudatta</i>. The rule [[6.2.1]] however regulates the accent, in supersession of the other three. (3) The third rule which does not apply to this <i>Bahuvrihi</i>-<i>vat</i> एकैक is the rule of <i>samasanta</i> affixing. Thus ऋक् ॠक्, पूः पूः (doubled by [[8.1.10]]) do not get the <i>samasanta</i> affix अ by [[5.4.74]].
