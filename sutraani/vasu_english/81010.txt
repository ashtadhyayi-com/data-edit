A word is repeated and is treated like a member of a बहुव्रीहि समास when a mental distress over something is expressed.
Thus गत꣡गतः 'gone, gone to my affliction', नष्ट꣡नष्टः, पतित꣡पतितः, in the masculine, and गतगता, नष्टनष्टा, पतितपतिता in the Feminine (not गतागता for the reasons given in the preceding aphorism). The accent is governed by [[6.2.1]].
