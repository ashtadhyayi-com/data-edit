In the following rules, the double-word is treated like a कर्मधारय समास ।
The reason for making it a <i>Karmadharaya</i> is to elide the case-affix [[2.4.71]], to make the first member a masculine term even when the word refers to a feminine [[6.3.42]], and to regulate the accent by [[6.1.223]]. Thus पटुपटुः, मृदुमृदुः where the first member has lost the case-affix. पटुपट्वी, मृदुमृद्वी where the first member is treated as a masculine, even when there is a क in the penultimate as कालककालिका (See [[6.3.37]] and [[6.3.42]]; पटुपटुः꣡, पटुपट्वी꣡, the accent falls on the final, for the rule [[6.1.223]] was debarred by [[8.1.3]], but the present rule re-instates [[6.1.223]]. The word उत्तरेषु is for the sake of distinctness, the <i>sutra</i> being an <i>adhikara</i> one, would have applied to the subsequent aphorisms, without even the word <i>uttareshu</i>.
