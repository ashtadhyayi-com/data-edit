The words प्रिय and सुख are repeated optionally when they mean 'easily, without any difficulty'.
The word कृच्छ्र means 'difficulty and sorrow', अकृच्छ्र means 'without difficulty or sorrow, i.e. pleasantly'. Thus प्रियप्रियेण ददाति, सुखसुखेन ददाति, or प्रियेण ददाति, सुखेन ददाति = अतिप्रियमपि वस्त्व नायासेन ददाति ॥ That is, he gives with pleasure, without feeling it as a trouble. Why do we say "when meaning easily"? Observe प्रियः पुत्र: "beloved son". सुखी रथः ॥
