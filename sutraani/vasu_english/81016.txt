Up to इडाया वा [[8.3.54]], inclusive, should be always supplied in every subsequent sūtra the phrase 'of a word' or 'to the whole of a word'.
This is an <i>adhikara</i> <i>sutra</i>, and extends up to [[8.3.55]]. Whatever we shall treat of here-after, should be understood to apply to a full '<i>pada</i>' or a completed word. Thus [[8.2.23]], (संयोगान्तस्य लोपः) teaches "there is elision of the final of what ends in a conjunct consonant". The word पदस्य must be supplied here to complete the sense : viz, of a word which ends in a conjunct consonant, the final is elided. Thus पचन्, यजन्, from पचन्त् and यजन्त् ॥

Why do we say 'of a <i>Pada</i>'? Observe पचन्तौ, यजन्तौ where the त् though <i>sanyoganta</i> is not elided, because the stem is no longer called <i>pada</i>. The force of the Genitive in पदस्य must be construed according to the context, sometimes as <i>sthana</i>-<i>shashthi</i> i.e. "in the room of the whole <i>pada</i>"; and sometimes as <i>avayava</i>-<i>shashthi</i> i.e. "of a <i>pada</i>-of the portion of a <i>pada</i> ".
