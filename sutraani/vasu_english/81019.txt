All the syllables of the Vocative Case are unaccented when a word precedes them and they do not stand at the beginning of a hemistich.
Thus पचसि दे॒व॒द॒त्त॒, पचसि य॒ज्ञ॒द॒त्त॒ ॥ The Vocative is acutely accented on the first by [[6.1.198]], the present makes it all unaccented.

Vart:- The rules relating to <i>nighata</i> (by which all syllables of a word become unaccented, such as the present, and [[8.1.28]] &c) and to the substitutes of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> apply then only, when the preceding word which would cause the <i>nighata</i> or the substitution, is part of the same sentence with the latter word. Therefore not here:- अयं दण्डो, हरानेन ॥ "This is the staff. Carry by means of it." Here हर does not lose its accent by [[8.1.28]], though preceded by the Noun <i>danda</i>, because these are parts of two different sentences. ओदनं पच, तव भविष्यति । ओदनं पच, मम भविष्यति ॥ "Cook the food, it will be for thee. Cook the food, it will be for me." That is the rice cooked by thee, will do both for thyself and myself. Here the ते and मे substitutions have not taken place [[8.1.22]] for <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i>, for the same reason.

Another example is, भवतीह विष्णुमित्रो, देवदत्तागच्छ "<i>Vishnumitra</i> is here, Come back <i>Devadatta</i>." Here <i>Devadatta</i>, though in the Vocative case, does not lose its accent. Nor can you say that समर्थः पदविधिः will make this <i>vartika</i> redundant. In all the above examples, the different sentences are connected with each other in sense. Thus in the last example, <i>Devadatta</i> was searching for <i>Vishnumitra</i>, when some one says to him, 'Here is <i>Vishnumitra</i> come back <i>Devadatta</i>." Thus the two sentences are <i>samartha</i>, yet there is no <i>nighata</i>. But the rule will apply here:- इह देवदत्त ! माता ते कथयति । नद्यास्तिष्ठति॑ [[8.1.28]] कूलं । शालीनां ते ओदनं दास्यामि ॥ In the last examples the Vocatives, the verbs and the substitutes of <i>yushmad</i> and <i>asmad</i> are not in syntactical construction with the words that immediately precede them, and yet the <i>nighata</i> rule &c does apply: inspite of the general maxim समर्थः पदविधिः [[2.1.1]], for rules relating to completed words apply to such words only which are in construction.

In the last example, the construction is इह स्थिता माता ते देवदत्त, and not इह देवदत्त. Thus इह is in syntactical construction with स्थिता and not देवदत्त, yet it causes <i>nighata</i> of <i>Devadatta</i>. Similarly in नद्यास्तिष्ठति कूलं, the word नद्याः is not in construction with तिष्ठति, but with कूलं, i.e. नद्याः कूलं तिष्ठति; yet it causes the <i>nighata</i> of तिष्ठति ॥ Similarly शालीनां is not in construction with ते, but with ओदनं, i.e. शालीनां ओदनं ते दास्यामि ॥ Yet it causes ते substitution of <i>yushmad</i>. Though the preceding words are not <i>samartha</i> with regard to the words that follow them, they cause the changes, because the words are in the same sentence.
