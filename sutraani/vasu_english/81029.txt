Thus श्वः कर्त्ता꣡, श्वः कर्त्ता꣡रौ, मासेन कर्ता꣡रः ॥ The <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affixes डा, रौ, रस्, are <i>anudatta</i> after the affix तासि by [[6.1.186]], the whole affix तास् becomes <i>udatta</i> [[3.1.3]] and where the टि portion of तास् i. e. the syllable आस्, is elided before the affix डा, there also the आ of डा becomes <i>udatta</i>, because the <i>udatta</i> has been elided. See [[6.1.161]].
