The finite verb retains its accent in connection with नह when used in the sense of forbidding.
When something urged by one, is rejected insultingly by another, then the reply made by the first tauntingly, with a negation, is <i>pratyarambha</i>. Thus A says to B: "Eat this please". B rejects the offer repeatedly, in anger or jest. Then A in anger or jest says "No, you will eat"-as नह भोक्ष्यसे ॥ Here भोक्ष्यसे retains its accent, which is acute on the middle, for से becomes accentless as it follows अदुपदेश [[6.1.186]], and स्य becomes <i>udatta</i> by the प्रत्ययस्वर [[3.1.3]].

Another example is नहाध्येष्यसे 'No, you will study'. Why do we say, 'when asseverative? Observe नह वै त꣡स्मिंश्च लोके꣡ द꣡क्षिणमिच्छ॒न्ति॒ "Verily in that world they do not wish for fee". Here it is pure negation. तस्मिन् is first acute by फिट् accent, लोक꣡ is final acute because it is formed by अच् of पचादि [[3.1.134]], द꣡क्षिण is first acute, because it is a Pronoun ending in अ (स्वाङ्गशिटामदन्तानाम् <i>Phit</i> II.6) and इच्छन्ति is <i>anudatta</i> by [[8.1.28]].
