The finite verb retains its accent in connection with अङ्ग when used in a friendly assertion.
Anything done to injure another is <i>prati</i>-<i>loma</i>, opposite of this is <i>apratiloma</i>, or friendliness. In fact, it is equal to <i>anuloma</i>. Thus अङ्ग प꣡च 'yes, you may cook', Here <i>anga</i> has the force of friendly permission. So also अङ्ग प꣡ठ ॥ But when it has the force of <i>pratiloma</i>, we have:- अङ्ग कूजा꣡ ३ वृषल ॥ इदानीं ज्ञास्यसि जाल्म "Well, chuckle O sinner! soon wilt thou learn, O coward". Here अङ्ग is used in the sense of censure, for chuckling is a thing not liked by the person: and is <i>pratiloma</i> action: for <i>pluta</i>-vowel see [[8.2.96]].
