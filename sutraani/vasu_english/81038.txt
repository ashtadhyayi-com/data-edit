A finite verb loses its accent when it denotes 'praise' and is joined immediately with यावत् and यथा through the intervention of an उपसर्ग (verbal Preposition).
The last <i>sutra</i> taught that the verb loses its accent when immediately preceded by यावत् and यथा ॥ This qualifies the word 'immediately' and teaches that the intervention of a Preposition does not debar immediateness. Thus यथा प्रकरोति चारु, यथा प्रपचति शोभनं, यावत् प्रकरोति चारु, यावत् प्रपचति शोभनम् ॥

The word 'immediately' is understood here also. Thus यावद् देवदत्तः प्रप꣡चति, शोभनं, यथा विष्णुमित्रः प्रकरोति चारु ॥ The <i>upasarga</i> प्र has <i>udatta</i> accent. Prof. Bohtlingk's Edition reads the sutra as व्यपेतं ॥
