The finite verb retains its accent in connection with 1. तु 2. पश्य 3. पश्यत and 4. अह when meaning 'praise'.
Thus माणवकस्तु भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम्; पश्य माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनं, पश्यत माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम्, अह माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम् ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning praise'? Observe, पश्य मृगो धा॒व॒ति॒ ॥

The repetition of the word पूजायाम् here, though its <i>anuvritti</i> could have been supplied from [[8.1.37]], shows that the negation of that <i>sutra</i> does not extend here: for the पूजायाम् of that <i>sutra</i> is connected with two negatives, the म of that <i>sutra</i>, and the न of [[8.1.29]], but the पूजायाम् of this <i>sutra</i> is connected with the general न of [[8.1.29]] only.
