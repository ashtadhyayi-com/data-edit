The finite verb retains its accent in connection with अहो when meaning 'praise'.
Thus अहो देवदत्तः प꣡चति शोभनं, अहो विष्णुमित्रः करो꣡ति चारु ॥ The separation of this अहो from तु &c, of the last <i>sutra</i>, indicates that the next rule applies to अहो only. Had अहो been joined with तु &c, then Rule [[8.1.41]], would have applied to तु &c, which is not desired. Hence the making of it a separate <i>sutra</i>.
