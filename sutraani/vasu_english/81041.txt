The finite verb optionally retains its accent in connection with अहो in the remaining cases (i.e. where it does not mean 'praise').
What is the शेष alluded to here? The शेष means here senses other than पूजा or 'praise'. Thus कटमहो करिष्यसि or कटमहो क॒रि॒ष्य॒सि॒ ॥ This is a speech uttered in anger or envy and not in praise (असूया वचनं) ॥ So also मम गेहमेष्यसि ॥

The word शेष is employed in the <i>sutra</i> simply for the sake of distinctness; for <i>sutra</i> 40 applies to cases of <i>puja</i>, while this <i>sutra</i> will give option in cases other than <i>puja</i>.
