The finite verb optionally retains its accent in connection with पुरा when it means 'haste' (i.e. when पुरा means 'before').
The word परीप्सा means त्वरा or 'quick'. Thus अधीष्व माणवक पुरा विद्यो꣡तते विद्युत्, or पुरा स्तनयति स्तनयित्नु ॥ The word पुरा here expresses the future occurrence which is imminent or very near at hand. It is against the rule of <i>Dharmasastras</i> to study while it thunders or lightens.

Why do we say 'when meaning haste'? Observe नडेन स्म पुराधी॒य॒ते॒ ॥ Here the word पुरा expresses a past time; that is, it means "long ago". So also ऊर्णया स्म पुराधीयते ॥ See [[3.2.118]] and [[3.2.122]], for the employment of पुर in the Past Tense, and [[3.3.4]], for the Present.
