The finite verb optionally retains its accent in connection with किम् when with this is asked a question relating to an action and when the verb is not preceded by a preposition or a negation.
Thus किं देवदत्तः प꣡चति, आहोस्विद् भुङ्क्ते ॥ किं देवदत्तः शेते꣡, आहोस्विदधीते꣡ ॥ Here some say, that the first verb (पचति or शेते) being directly joined with किं retains its accent, whilst the second verb (भुङ्क्ते or अधीते) not being joined with किं, loses its accent by the general rule [[8.1.28]]. Others say, though the word किं is heard in connection with one verb only, yet as both verbs are objects of doubt, therefore, किं is logically connected with both of them, and so both verbs retain their accents. Thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ will retain its accent according to this view.

Why do we say when the question relates to a क्रिया or action? The rule will not apply, when the question relates to an object or साधन ॥ Thus किं देवदत्त ओदनं प॒च॒ति॒ आहोस्विच्छाकं ॥

Why do we say "when a question is asked"? Observe किमधीते देवदत्तः ॥ Here किं is used to express contempt, and not to ask a question.

Why do we say 'not preceded by a Preposition'? Observe किं देवदत्तः प्रपचति आहोस्वित् प्रकरोति ॥

Why do we say "not preceded by a negative particle". Observe किं देवदत्तो न पठति आहोस्वित् न करोति ॥
