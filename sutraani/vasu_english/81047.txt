The finite verb optionally retains its accent after जातु when this जातु is not preceded by another word.
Thus जा꣡तु भोक्ष्य꣡से, जातु अध्यष्य꣡से, जातु करिष्या꣡मि । Here से is <i>anudatta</i> by [[6.1.186]], as it is an <i>Sarvadhatuka</i> affix coming after an अदुपदेश; the word जातु is first acute, as it is a <i>Nipata</i>. Why do we say 'when not preceded by any other word'? Observe:- कटं जातु क॒रि॒ष्य॒ति॒ ॥ The word कटं is end-acute as it is a फिट् or noun.
