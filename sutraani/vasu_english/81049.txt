Also after an immediately preceding आहो and उताहो when these follow, no other word, the verb retains its accent.
The prohibition of <i>nighata</i> or want of accentuation is understood here, so also there is the <i>anuvritti</i> of अपूर्वं from the last.

Thus आहो or उताहो भुङ्क्ते꣡, उताहो प꣡ठति ॥ Why do we say 'immediately preceding'? In the following <i>sutra</i> will be taught option, when these particles do not immediately precede the verb.

Why do we say "when no word precedes them"? Observe देवदत्त आहो or उताहो भुं॒क्ते॒ ॥
