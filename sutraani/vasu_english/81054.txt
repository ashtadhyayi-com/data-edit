An Imperative with a preposition preceding it, may optionally retain its accent, in connection with हन्त , but not in the 1st person.
With the exception of गत्यर्थ लोटा &c, the whole of the preceding <i>sutra</i> is understood here.

Thus हन्त प्र꣡ वि॒श॒ or प्रविश꣡, हन्त प्र꣡ शाधि or प्रशाधि꣡ ॥ But no option is allowed here हन्त कुरु꣡, as it is not preceded by a preposition. Here rule [[8.1.30]], makes the accent compulsory after हन्त ॥ So also हन्त प्रभुन꣡जावहै, हन्त प्रभुन꣡जामहै, where the 1st Person is used, the verb retains its accent compulsorily by [[8.1.30]].

The word प्रभुनजावहै is Imperative First Person, Dual of the root भुज् in <i>Atmanepada</i> (1.3. 66). The Personal ending वहै is <i>anudatta</i> by [[6.1.186]], because the verb is <i>anudatta</i> <i>it</i>. The <i>vikarana</i> न therefore retains its accent.
