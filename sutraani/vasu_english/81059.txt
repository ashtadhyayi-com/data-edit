The first finite verb only retains its accent in connection with च and वा।
The <i>anuvritti</i> of अगतेः which was drawn in the last <i>sutra</i>, does not run into this. Thus गर्दभांश्च काल꣡यति, वीणां च वा॒द॒य॒ति॒ ॥ गर्दभान् वा काल꣡यति, वीणां वा वा॒द॒य॒ति॒ ॥

The word योग in the <i>sutra</i> indicates that the mere connection with the verb is meant, whether this connection takes place by adding these words च and वा, before the verb, or after the verb, is immaterial for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i>, (not so in the last). The word प्रथमा shows that the first verb is governed by this rule and not the second.
