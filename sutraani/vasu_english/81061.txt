In connection with अह , the first finite verb retains its accent when it refers to various commissions (as well as when a breach of good manners is condemned).
The word विनियोग means sending a person to perform several commissions. The word च in the <i>sutra</i> draws in the <i>anuvritti</i> of क्षिया also.

Thus त्वं अह ग्रामं गच्छ, त्वं अह अरण्यं गच्छ ॥ So also when क्षिया is meant, as स्वयमह रथेन याति ३, उपाध्यायं पदातिं गमयति ॥ स्वयमहौदनं भुङ्क्ते ३, उपाध्यायं सक्तून् पाययति ॥ The prohibition of _nighata and prolation are as in the last aphorism.
