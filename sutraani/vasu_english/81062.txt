When च and अह are elided, the first finite verb still retains its accent when एव with the force of limitation, takes their place.
When does this लोप take place ? Where the sense of च or अह is connoted by the sentence, but these words are not directly employed, there is then the elision of च and अह ॥ There the force of च is that of aggregation (समुच्चय), and of अह is that of 'only' (केवल). The च is elided when the agent is the same, and अह is elided when the agents are several.

Thus where च is elided:- देवदत्त एव ग्रामं ग꣡च्छतु, देवदत्त एवारण्यं गच्छतु = ग्रामं चारण्यं च गच्छतु ॥

So where अह is elided: as:- देवदत्त एव ग्रामं ग꣡च्छतु, यज्ञदत्त एव अरण्यं गच्छतु = ग्रामं केवलं, अरण्यं केवलं ॥

Why do we say अवधारणं 'when limitation is meant'? See देवदत्तः क्वेव भोक्ष्यते, देवदत्तः क्वेव वाध्येष्यते ॥ The word एव here has the sense of 'never' 'an impossibility'. The first sentence means न क्वचिद् भोक्ष्यते ॥ क्व + एव = क्वेव by पररूप [[6.1.94]] <i>Vartika</i>)).
