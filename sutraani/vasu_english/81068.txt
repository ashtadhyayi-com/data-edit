(After such words denoting praise) the finite verb (which is praised) becomes अनुदात्त even along with the गति , if any, that may precede it.
Whether a finite verb is compounded with a <i>gati</i> or stands single, both the compound and the simple verb lose their accent, when it is qualified by the adverbs काष्ठं &c. Thus यत् काष्ठं प॒च॒ति॒, यत् काष्ठं प्र॒प॒च॒ति॒ ॥ By [[8.1.28]], the finite verb would have lost its accent after the word काष्ठं, but this loss was prohibited by [[8.1.30]] in connection with यत्; the present <i>sutra</i> re-ordains the loss, by setting aside the prohibition of [[8.1.30]].

The word सगति 'along with its <i>Gati</i>', indicates that the <i>Gati</i> even loses its accent. The word <i>Gati</i> here is restricted to <i>Upasargas</i>. Therefore not here यत् काष्ठं शुक्ली करोति, यत् काष्ठं कृष्णी करोति ॥

The word तिङ् is used in the <i>sutra</i> to indicate that the words qualified by काष्ठं &c in the preceding <i>sutra</i>, were non तिङ् words- i. e. were substantives. The rule of मलोपश्च of that <i>sutra</i>, therefore, does not apply here.
