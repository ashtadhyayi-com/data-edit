A finite verb along with its preceding गति , if any, become अनुदात्त when a noun denoting the fault of the action follows, with the exception of गोत्र etc.
<i>Karika</i>

सुपि कुत्सने क्रियाया मलोप इष्टोऽतिङीति चोक्तार्थे ।
पूतिश्च चानुबन्धो विभाषितं चापि बह्वर्थम् ॥

The <i>anuvritti</i> of पदात् [[8.1.17]] ceases. But the <i>anuvritti</i> of the last <i>sutra</i> is current. Thus प॒च॒ति॒ पूति, प्र॒प॒च॒ति॒ पूति, प॒च॒ति॒ मिथ्या, प्र॒प॒च॒ति॒ मिथ्या ॥

Why do we say कुत्सने 'denoting the fault of the action'? See प꣡चति शोभनम् ॥

Why do we say सुपि 'a noun'? Observe प꣡चति क्लिश्नाति ॥

Why do we say with the exception of गोत्र &c. See प꣡चति गोत्रम्, प꣡चति ब्रुवम्, पचति प्रवचनम् ॥

Vart:- It should be mentioned that the 'fault' mentioned in the <i>sutra</i>, must be the fault relating to the mode of doing the action, denoted by the verb. The rule will not apply, if the कुत्सन refers to the agent and not to the action. Thus प꣡चति पूतिर्देवदत्तः, प्रपचति पूतिः ॥

Vart:- It should be stated that पूति has an indicatory  च ॥ The effect of this is that the word पूति is finally acute, because of the indicatory च ॥ The word पूति is not a क्तिन् formed word, because it is not feminine, as we find it in sentences like पूतिरयम्; nor is it a word formed by क्तिच् affix, because this is not a संज्ञा word; therefore, it is a word without a derivation. Therefore by प्रातिपदिक स्वर (<i>Phit</i> I.1) it will be end-acute. The <i>vartika</i>, therefore, indicates that when पूति causes the loss of accent of the verb, then it is end-acute, but in other cases it is acute on the beginning. According to <i>Padamanjari</i>, पूति is derived from पू by adding the <i>Unadi</i> affix तिप् diversely (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 180), and is first acute.

Vart:- A finite verb in the plural number, loses its accent optionally: when it loses its accent, then पूति is end-acute. Thus प॒च॒न्ति॒ पूतिः꣡, or पचन्ति पू꣡तिः, प्रप॒च॒न्ति॒ पूतिः꣡ or प्रपचन्ति पू꣡तिः ॥

<i>Karika</i>:- The following noun denoting fault must refer to the action. The elision of म is intended only in the case of non-verbs, because it is so said by those of old. The word पूति has an indicatory च, but it is optionally so when the verb is plural. The elision of म् mentioned above refers to the elision of म् in दारुणम्-अध्यापकः = दारुणाध्यापकः ॥ The words उक्तार्थम् mean आचार्यपरंपराकथितप्रयोजनमेतदित्यर्थः ॥
