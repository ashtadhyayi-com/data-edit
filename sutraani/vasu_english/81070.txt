A गति becomes unaccented when followed by another गति .
Thus अभ्यु꣡द्धरति, स॒मुदा꣡मयति, अभि॒सं॒प॒र्या꣡ हरति ॥ Why do we say गतिः "a <i>Gati</i> becomes &c"? Observe दे꣡वदत्तः प्रपचति ॥ Here देवदत्त is a <i>Pratipadika</i> and does not lose its accent. Why do we say 'when followed by a <i>Gati</i>'? Observe आ꣡ मन्द्रैरिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि मयूर रोमभिः ॥ Here आ is a <i>Gati</i> to the verb याहि, the complete verb is आयाहि ॥ But as आ is not followed by a <i>Gati</i>, but by a <i>Pratipadika</i> मन्द्र, it retains its accent. Had the word गतौ not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, this आ would have lost its accent, because the rule would have been too wide, without any restriction of what followed it.
