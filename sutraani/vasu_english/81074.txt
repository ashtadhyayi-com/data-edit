When the preceding Vocative is in the plural number, it is optionally considered as non-existent, if the subsequent Vocative, in apposition with it, is a specific term.
This ordains option, where the last <i>sutra</i> would have made the consideration of the first vocative as existent compulsory. Thus दे꣡वाः श꣡रण्याः or दे꣡वा श॒र॒ण्याः॒ ॥ ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै꣡याकरणाः or ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै॒या॒क॒र॒णाः॒ ॥

The <i>anuvritti</i> of सामान्यवचनम् is understood here; the second vocative, therefore, must be a विशेषवचन, as being the correlative of the former: where is then the necessity of employing the word विशेषवचने in the <i>sutra</i>? This word is used in the aphorism for the sake of precision only.

Why do we say 'in the plural number'? Observe मा꣡णवक ज॒टि॒ल॒क॒ ॥ No option is allowed here, and the preceding vocative is always considered as existent and so rule [[8.1.73]] applies.

The <i>sutras</i> [[8.1.73]] and [[8.1.74]] as enunciated by <i>Panini</i> are:- 73. नामन्त्रिते समानाधिकरणे; 74. सामान्यवचनं विभाषितं विशेषवचने (i. e. [[8.1.73]]. The preceding Vocative is not considered as non-existent, if the subsequent word is a Vocative in apposition with it. 74. Optionally so, if the preceding vocative is a general term and the subsequent vocative is a particular term). <i>Patanjali</i> made the amendment by adding सामान्यवचने to 73 also, and the author of <i>Kasika</i> has added बहुवचनम् to 74 from the commentary of <i>Patanjali</i> and has omitted सामान्यवचनं from it: though he reads its <i>anuvritti</i>.
