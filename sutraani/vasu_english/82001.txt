Whatever will be taught hereafter, up to the end of the work, is to be considered as not taken effect, in relation to the application of a preceding rule.
This is an <i>Adhikara</i> or governing rule, and extends upto the end of the Book. Whatever we shall teach hereafter is to be understood as non-existent, with regard to the preceding rule. With regard to whatever has been taught in the preceding Seven Books and a quarter, the rules contained in these three last chapters are considered as <i>asiddha</i>. And further, in these three chapters, a subsequent rule is, as if it had not taken effect, so far as any preceding rule is concerned. The word in असिद्धम् = असिद्धवद्भवति, सिद्धकार्यं न करोति ॥ The rule is "as if non-effective, does not produce the operation of a <i>siddha</i> or effective rule". This rule of non-effectiveness is for the sake of prohibiting the operation of an <i>adesa</i> rule, and establishing the operation of an <i>utsarga</i> or general rule. Thus अस्मा उद्धर; द्वा अत्र; द्वा आनय, असा आदित्यः ॥ In all these, the elision of व् and य् by [[8.3.19]], being considered as not to have taken effect, there is no further <i>sandhi</i>, and आ + उ does not give rise to <i>guna</i>, nor आ + अ = आ ॥ In fact, for the purposes of the application of आद्गुणः rule of [[6.1.87]], or the दीर्घ rule of [[6.1.101]], the rule [[8.3.19]] is considered as not to have taken effect at all.

Similarly अमुष्मै, अमुष्मात्, अमुष्मिन् from अदस् ॥ Thus अदस् + ङे = अद + ङे [[7.2.102]] अ being substituted for the final स्, which again merges in the preceding अ [[6.1.97]] = अमु + ङे [[8.2.80]]. उ being substituted for अ, and म् for द् of अद). Now the substitution of स्मै for ङे takes place only after Pronouns ending in अ; but अमु is a pronoun ending in उ, so this स्मै [[7.1.14]] should not take place. The present <i>sutra</i> helps us out of this difficulty, and the change of अ into उ by [[8.2.80]] is considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the application of [[7.1.14]].

शुष्किका शुष्कजङ्घा च क्षामिमानौजढत्तथा ।
मतोर्वत्वे भलां जश्त्वं, गुडलिण्मान्निदर्शनम् ॥

The forms शुष्किका, शुष्कजङ्घा, क्षामिमान्, औजढत्, and गुडलिण्मान् illustrate this rule excellently.

(1) शुष्किका ॥ To the root शुष् we add the <i>Nishtha</i> त, as शुष् + त = शुष् + क (त changed to क by [[8.2.51]]) = शुष्क ॥ Add the feminine affix टाप् and we have शुष्का ॥ Add to this the affix क [[5.3.70]], [[5.3.73]], as शुष्का + क  = शुष्काक, the feminine of which with टाप् will be शुष्कका (the shortening taking place by [[7.4.13]]). Now अ is changed to इ by [[7.3.44]] and we have शुष्किका ॥ Now rule [[7.3.46]] makes this इ substitution optional, when a क् precedes the अ, as is the case here: and that rule would require the alternative form शुष्कका ॥ But there is no such alternative form, because the क of शुष्क was the substitute of त by [[8.2.51]], which is considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of the application of [[7.3.46]].

(2) शुष्कजङ्घा ॥ Here rule [[6.3.37]] would have required the form to be शुष्काजङ्घा like मद्रिकाकल्पा; there being no <i>pun</i>-<i>vad</i>-<i>bhava</i> when there is a penultimate क ॥ But the क in शुष्का being the result of [[8.2.51]] is considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of [[6.3.37]].

(3) क्षामिमान् ॥ This word may be considered to have been formed by adding the affix मतुप् to the Patronymic word क्षामिः or to the noun क्षामिन् [क्षामस्यापत्यं = क्षामिः, or क्षामोऽस्यास्तीति = क्षामिन्] ॥ The word क्षाम is formed by adding the <i>Nishtha</i> त to the root क्षै, as क्षै + त + क्षा + त [[6.1.45]] = क्षाम (the त being changed to म by [[8.2.53]]). Now this म is considered as non-effectual for the purposes of application of [[8.2.9]], which requires the change of म of मत् to व, when मत् is added to a word having a penultimate म, as in शमीवान् ॥ Therefore we have क्षामिमान् and not क्षामिवान् ॥

(4) औजढत् ॥ This is the Aorist third person singular of the Derivative root औढि, from the Past-Participle of वह् ॥ Thus वह् + त = ऊढ [[6.1.15]]. Add to it णिच् in the sense of तमाख्यत् [[3.1.26]]: and then form its लुङ् ॥ The लुङ् is formed by adding चङ् [[3.1.48]], before which the stem is reduplicated [[6.1.11]]. In reduplicating, all the rules that went before in forming ऊढ are considered <i>asiddha</i>; viz. the rule by which ह was changed to ढ (as वह् + त = उह् + त = उढ् + त [[8.1.31]], the rule by which त was changed to ध (उढ् + त = उढ् + ध [[8.1.40]], the rule by which ध was changed to ढ [[8.4.41]], and the rule by which the first ढ was elided [[8.3.13]] as उढ् + ढ = उ + ढ = ऊढ [[6.3.111]]. The elision of टि before णि being considered <i>sthanivat</i>, we reduplicate ह्त; as ऊह्तढ + चङ् + त् = ऊहढत् [[7.4.60]] = ऊझढत् [[7.4.62]] = ऊजढत् [[8.4.54]]. There is no इ added by [[7.4.79]], because of the prohibition of अनग्लोपे of [[7.4.93]]. With the augment, it becomes औजढत् ॥ The form औजिढत् is from उढि ending in the affix क्तिन् ॥

(5) गुडलिण्मान् ॥ This is formed by adding मतुप् to the word गुडलिह्, which is formed by क्विप् (गुडं लेढि) Here also the म of मतुप् is not changed into व by [[8.2.10]]; because the change of ह् to ढ् [[8.1.3]], and again of ढ् to ड् are considered <i>asiddha</i>.

The rules of interpretation, however, contained in the previous part will apply to this part also; because such rules cannot be considered 'prior' or पूर्व; for they become operative then only when occasion requires to apply them. The maxim which governs such rules is कार्यकालं हि संज्ञा परिभाषम् ॥ The rules, therefore, which are exhibited here in the sixth case such as [[8.2.23]], or the seventh case, as [[8.2.26]], or the fifth case, as [[8.2.27]], should be interpreted in accordance with the <i>sutras</i> षष्ठी स्थाने योगा, तस्मिन्निति निर्दिष्टे पूर्वस्य, तस्मादिति उत्तरस्य ॥

But with regard to the <i>paribhasha</i> विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यं, the above will not hold good. For, by the very fact, that a subsequent rule in these chapters, is held to be <i>asiddha</i>, with regard to the prior, there cannot arise any conflict of two rules of equal force with regard to them. And it is only where there is such a conflict, that the above rule of interpretation applies. This being so, in विस्फोर्यम्, अवगोर्यम् formed by ण्यत् [[3.1.124]] the <i>guna</i> ordained by [[7.3.86]] is not debarred by the दीर्घ rule [[8.2.77]], because there is no conflict between <i>guna</i> rule [[7.3.86]] and the <i>dirgha</i>-rule [[8.2.77]], for the latter is simply non-existent with regard to the former.

But though the विप्रतिषेध rule does not apply in these chapters; yet an <i>apavada</i> rule here even, does over-ride an <i>utsarga</i> rule, for otherwise, the enunciation of an <i>apavada</i> rule would be useless. The <i>apavada</i> rule is therefore, not considered <i>asiddha</i>. Thus the <i>utsarga</i> rule होढः [[8.2.31]] is set aside by the <i>apavada</i> rule दादेर्धातोर्घः [[8.2.32]], and thus we have दोग्धा, दोग्धुम् (दुह् + तृच् = दोघ् + तृच्) ॥
