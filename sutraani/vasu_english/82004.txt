A स्वरित vowel is the substitute of an अनुदात्त vowel when the latter follows after such a semi-vowel which has replaced an उदात्त (acute accent) or a स्वरित vowel.
An unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>, when it comes after a यण् (semi-vowel), which यण् itself has come in the room of a vowel which was acute or <i>svarita</i> once.

Let us first take the vowel following an <i>udatta</i> <i>yan</i>. Thus कुमा॒र्यौ॑, कुमा॒॑र्यः ॥ The word कुमारी꣡ is acutely accented on the final, because the long ई (ङीप्) replaces अ꣡ of कुमार [[6.1.161]]. The semi-vowel य् is substituted in the room of this acute ई꣡; the <i>anudatta</i> आ and अः become <i>svarita</i> after such a य् ॥

Now to take an example of a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>. The words सकृल्लू꣡ and खलपू꣡ are finally acute by <i>krit</i>-accent [[6.2.139]]. The Locative singular of these words are खलपू꣡ + इ॒ = खल्पिवं, and सकृल्ल्वि by [[6.4.83]]. This व् is a semi-vowel which comes in the room of the acute ऊ꣡, therefore, it is <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i>. After this <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i>, the <i>anudatta</i> इ of the Locative becomes <i>svarita</i> by the first part of this <i>sutra</i>. Now when खलप्वि॑ + आशा꣡ and सकृल्ल्वि॑ + आशा꣡ are combined by <i>sandhi</i>, this <i>svarita</i> इ is changed to य्; it is, therefore, a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>. The unaccented आ will become <i>svarita</i>, after this <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>. As खलप्व्या॑शा and सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा ॥ The word आशा is finally acute and consequently आ is not acute (<i>Phit</i>. I.18).

Objection:- Here an objector may say: that the <i>svarita</i> accent on इ in खलप्वि is by this very <i>sutra</i>, this <i>svarita</i> is to be considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of यण् <i>adesa</i> of [[6.4.83]]. How can then the य् substituted for this इ be considered as <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i>?

Answer:- This is considered as <i>siddha</i> by <i>asraya</i>. (आश्रयात् सिद्धत्वम्) ॥

Objection :-If this be so, then उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः [[8.4.66]] should also be considered as <i>siddha</i>: and we should have <i>svarita</i> in दध्याशा &c also. For the word द꣡धि is first-acute by <i>Phit</i> Il. 3. Therefore धि is <i>svarita</i> by [[8.4.66]]. The य् is <i>svarita</i> <i>yan</i>, the <i>anudatta</i> आ after this should become <i>svarita</i> according this view, but this is not so.

Answer:- To avoid this difficulty, we have the following.

Vart:- यण्स्वरो यणादेशो सिद्धो वक्तव्यः ॥ "The यण् accent should be considered as valid, for the purposes of यण् substitution".

Some say, that even in such cases as दध्या॑शा the above rule applies, and that the unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>, if it follows a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i> which is preceded by an acute vowel. They quote the following from <i>Taittariya</i> <i>sakha</i> : यास्ते विश्वाः समिधः सन्त्यग्ने, where the अ of अग्ने is pronounced as <i>svarita</i>. So also in the <i>Brahmana</i> portion as : दध्या॑शयति the आ is read as <i>svarita</i>. But according to <i>Katyayana</i> and <i>Patanjali</i>, the unaccented vowel does not become <i>svarita</i> by this <i>sutra</i>, when it follows a <i>svarita</i>-<i>yan</i> which is preceded by an acute vowel.

To get rid of these anomalies, the <i>Mahabhashya</i> proposes several alternatives, two of which will be mentioned here. The first proposal is to divide this composite <i>sutra</i> into two parts: (1) उदात्तयणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति "an unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i> when it follows after an <i>udatta</i> <i>yan</i>". (2) स्वरितयणश्च परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति "an unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>, when following a <i>svarita</i> <i>yan</i>" and in this second <i>sutra</i>, we shall read the <i>anuvritti</i> of <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i> from the preceding half. So that this half will mean: उदात्तयण इत्येवं यो निर्वृत्तः स्वरितः, तस्य यणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति ॥ The <i>svarita</i> must have been obtained by the application of the first half of this <i>sutra</i> and this <i>svarita</i> should be changed to यण्, which would change the <i>anudatta</i> into <i>svarita</i>. So that the स्वरित यणः means this particular <i>svarita</i> obtained by the application of this very <i>sutra</i>.

The second proposal is not to read <i>svarita</i> into the <i>sutra</i> at all. The <i>svarita</i> in सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा would then be explained by <i>udatta</i>-<i>yanah</i> rule. सकृल्लू + इ + आशा = सकृल्ल्व् + य् + आशा ॥ Here व् is <i>udatta</i>-<i>yan</i>. This will cause आ to become <i>svarita</i>. The intervening <i>svarita</i> य् is considered as not existent for the purposes of accent स्वरविधौव्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् ॥ Nor is this य् to be considered as <i>sthani</i>-<i>vad</i> to इ by [[1.1.57]], for in applying the rule of accent, such a substitute is not considered as <i>sthanivat</i> by [[1.1.58]].

Why do we say " of <i>udatta</i> and <i>svarita</i>"? Observe बैदी꣡ + आशा꣡ = बैद्याशा, so also शार्ङ्गव्याशा ॥ Here the semi-vowel replaces an unaccented ई, and is अनुदात्त यण् ॥ These words are first acute owing to नित् accent [[4.1.73]].

Why do we say "an unaccented vowel becomes <i>svarita</i>"? Observe कुमार्यत्र, किशोर्यत्र ॥ The word अ꣡त्र is acutely accented on the first by लित् accent. [[6.1.193]].
