The single substitute of an unaccented with an उदात्त (acute accent) vowel is उदात्त।
The word "of an <i>anudatta</i>" is understood here. An unaccented vowel, which combined with the preceding <i>udatta</i> vowel remains as a single substitute, becomes <i>udatta</i>. Thus for the <i>udatta</i> इ of अग्नि꣡ and for the case-ending औ which is <i>anudatta</i>, there is always substituted long ई single by [[6.1.102]]. This single substitute will be <i>udatta</i> according to the present sutra<i>, as अग्नी꣡ ॥ Similarly वायू꣡, वृक्षैः꣡, प्लक्षैः꣡ ॥

Why do we say "with </i>udatta<i> vowel"? Observe पचन्ति, यजन्ति ॥ Here पच् + शप् + अन्ति = प꣡च् + अ + अन्ति । Here शप् is </i>anudatta<i> by [[3.1.4]], so also अन्ति by [[6.1.186]]. The </i>ekadesa<i> of these two non-accented अ will be </i>anudatta<i>. In forming this </i>para<i>-</i>rupa<i> </i>ekadesa<i> by [[6.1.97]], the </i>svarita<i> of the अ of शप् caused by [[8.4.66]] is considered as invalid or </i>asiddha<i>.

Other examples are क्व वोऽश्वाः (</i>Rig<i>. V. 61.2) and क्वावरं मरुतः ॥ The word वः is </i>anudatta<i> by [[8.1.21]]. read with [[8.1.18]]. The word अ꣡श्वः is acutely accented on the first, as it is formed by adding क्वन् to अश् (</i>Unadi<i> I.151). The स् of वस् is changed to व् [[8.2.66]], which is again changed to उ [[6.1.113]]. Thus वोऽश्वः ॥ Here अ becomes </i>purva<i>-</i>rupa<i> by [[6.1.109]], which is </i>udatta<i>. क्व is formed from किम् by अत् affix [[5.3.12]] and [[7.2.105]] and is </i>svarita<i> [[6.1.185]]. The word अ꣡वर is acutely accented on the first by the </i>Phit<i> II.6. The single long substitute is </i>udatta_.
