The न् at the end of a nominal-stem, which is a पद -- शेषो घ्यसखि [[1.4.7]], is elided.
The word पदस्य 'of a <i>Pada</i>' is understood in this <i>sutra</i>. Thus राजा, राजभ्याम्, राजभिः, राजता, राजतरः, राजतमः ॥ The Nominal stem राजन् gets the designation of <i>Pada</i>, before these affixes, by [[1.4.17]].

Why do we say 'of a <i>Pratipadika</i> or Nominal stem'? Observe अहन्नहिम् ॥ Here अहन् is a verb, the 3rd Person Singular Imperfect (लङ्) of the root हन् ॥

Why do we say 'at the end'? If the word अन्तस्य had not been used in the <i>sutra</i>, then the <i>sutra</i> would have stood thus नलोपः प्रातिपदिकस्य; and as the word पदस्य is understood here, the <i>sutra</i> would have meant, there is elision of न्, where ever it may be, of a <i>Pada</i> called stem. So that the न of नराभ्याम् would also have required elision. In fact, the genitive case here in पदस्य is not <i>sthana</i> <i>shashthi</i>, but <i>viseshana</i> <i>shashthi</i>, a नलोप अन्तग्रहणं पदाधिकारस्य विशेषणत्वात् ॥

Question: But even if you use the word अन्त in the <i>sutra</i>, it is compounded with the word प्रातिपदिक, and the sense of the <i>sutra</i> will be "न् which is at the end of a <i>pratipadika</i>, which (<i>pratipadika</i>) is a portion of a <i>pada</i>" &c. and not "न् which is at the end of a <i>pada</i>". So that the rule will not apply to अहन्नराभ्यां but will apply to राजानौ &c? Answer:- The word प्रातिपदिक is not compounded, with the word अन्त in the <i>sutra</i>. It is used without any case-affix, on the analogy of <i>Chhandas</i> usage. In fact, it is in the genitive case, the affix being elided by [[7.1.39]].

Vart:- The prohibition must be stated with regard to the elision of the न of अहन् ॥ As अहः, In अहर् the case-affix सु is <i>luk</i>-elided by [[7.1.23]], the <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i> is prohibited by [[1.1.63]], and hence the न् of अहन is changed to र् by [[8.2.69]]. अहोभ्याम्, अहोभिः ॥ For the rules [[8.2.68]] and [[8.2.69]] by which the final of अहन् is changed to र्, are <i>asiddha</i> with regard to this present rule requiring elision of न्, hence this <i>vartika</i>.

There is no necessity of this <i>vartika</i>, for the subsequent rules [[8.2.69]], [[8.2.68]] will debar नलोप ॥ Answer:- But रु and र are considered <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of न elision. The रु and र would have debarred न elision, had they otherwise found no scope. But they have their scope. Question: Where have they their scope? Answer:- In the penultimate अ i.e. in the अ preceding the न् ॥ Question: The very fact that the author has used the word अहन् in the <i>sutra</i> [[8.2.68]], shows that रु does not replace अ but न् ॥ Answer:- If so, then र will find scope in the Vocative, हे अहन् where न् is retained by [[8.2.8]], and it will be this न् which will be replaced by र्, as ह अहर् and so also हे दीर्घाहो निदाघ !

The word दीर्घाहन् is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i> [[2.2.24]], the Vocative affix is elided [[6.1.68]], and the न् changed to र् by [[8.2.68]], and it is changed to उ [[6.1.114]]. In हे अहन! the न् is not elided by the option of the <i>Vartika</i> under [[8.2.8]].

To remove these objections, they say, the word अहन् which is used in [[8.2.68]] is in nominative singular without the elision of न्, and it is to be repeated as अहन् अहन् ॥ The one indicates the exact form, showing that the न् is not elided; and by the second word the रु is ordained for this final न् ॥
