The word उदन्वान् is irregularly formed in the sense of 'a sea'.
It is derived from उदक 'water' with the affix मत् ॥ उदन्वान् is the name of a <i>Rishi</i>, because he controlled the rains, it rained at his command. It also means occan or that in which water is held, like तटाक &c. The affix कि is added by [[3.3.93]], and उदक changed to उद् by [[6.3.58]], and thus we have उदधिः ॥ Why do we say "when meaning a sea"? Observe उदकवान् घटः 'a pot having water'. Here the main idea is not that of "holding or containing", but simply the general fact of possessing water: a human being may also possess water in the same way.
