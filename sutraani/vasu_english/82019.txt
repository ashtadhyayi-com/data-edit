ल् is substituted for the र् of a preposition when अयते follows.
Thus पलायते, प्लायते ॥ Here arises the question, does the word अयति qualify the word र्, or does it qualify the word Preposition. In the first view, the <i>sutra</i> would mean, "the र् immediately followed by अयति is changed to ल ॥" But as a matter of fact,  र् is never immediately followed by अयति ॥ Thus in प्र + अयति or परा + अयति, the letter अ and आ intervene respectively. The <i>ekadesa</i> <i>sandhi</i> of these, will make र् immediately followed by अयति; but the <i>ekadesa</i>, being <i>sthanivat</i> will prevent it. This difficulty however, is overcome by the maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्, for otherwise the rule will be useless. For the same reasons, परि + अयते = पल्ययते, though here र् intervenes between र् and अयते ॥ In short, the intervention of one letter is considered as no intervention.

In the second view, the <i>sutra</i> would mean when a Preposition is followed by <i>ayat</i> then its र् is changed to ल, and none of these difficulties will arise with regard to the above forms. But then would arise a fresh difficulty, for the र् of प्रति would also require to be changed into ल् ॥ Some say, that प्रति is never followed by अयति; while others hold that the form प्लत्ययते (प्रति + अयते) is valid. According to the first view, the valid form is प्रत्ययते ॥ The स् of the Prepositions दुस् and निस् is changed to र्, but this र् is not changed to ल्, because it is <i>asiddha</i>: thus we have the forms निरयणम्, दुरयणम् ॥ But there is a preposition निर् also the र् of which is changed to ल्, as निलयनम् ॥ See [[7.2.46]]. According to the <i>Siddhanta</i> <i>Kaumudi</i>, there is a Preposition दुर् also, which gives दुलयते ॥
