The र् of परि is changed to ल् before घ and अङ्क।
As परिघः or पलिघः, पर्यङ्कः or पल्यङ्कः ॥ The word घ here means the word-form घ, and not the technical घ of तरप् and तमप् ॥ See [[3.3.84]] by which हन् is replaced by घ ॥

Vart:- So also, it must be stated, before the word योगः ॥ As, परियोगः or पलियोगः ॥
