The स् is elided when it is preceded by a झल् consonant (all consonant except semi-vowels and nasals) and is followed by an affix beginning with a झल् consonant.
Thus अभित्त for अभित्स्त, अभित्थाः for अभित्स्थाः ॥ So also अच्छित्त, अच्छित्थाः, अवात्ताम्, अवात्त ॥ The last example may also be explained by [[7.4.49]]; the elision of the स of सिच् being considered as <i>asiddha</i>, the स् of the root is changed to त् ॥

Why do we say 'of a <i>jhal</i> consonant'? Observe अमंस्त and अमंस्थाः ॥ Why do we say followed by a <i>jhal</i> consonant ? Observe अभित्साताम्, अभित्सत ॥

The स of this <i>sutra</i> refers also to the स of सिच्; no other स is elided. As सोममसुत् स्तोता; दृषत् स्थानम् ॥ Here the स of स्तोता and स्थानं, though preceded by a <i>jhal</i> letter त्, could never be elided as they do not form portion of one word.
