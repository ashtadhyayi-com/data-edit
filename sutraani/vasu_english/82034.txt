The ह of नह् is changed to ध before a before a झल् (all consonant except semi-vowels and nasals) letter or at the end of a word.
As नद्धा, नद्धुम्, नद्धव्यम्, उपानत्, परीणत् ॥ The त् of the affixes तृ &c, is changed to ध by [[8.2.40]]; and for the preceding ध is substituted द by [[8.4.53]]. उपानत् is formed by [[8.2.39]], read with [[8.4.56]]. परीणत् is formed by क्विप् as it belongs to सम्पदादि class, the lengthening is by [[6.3.116]], and ण-change by [[8.4.14]]. It would have shortened the processes of transformation, had only द been ordained in the <i>sutra</i>, instead of ध; but the ordaining of ध is for the purposes of [[8.2.40]], by which there should be ध for the participial त &c, in नद्धम्, and that there should not be the change of this <i>Nishtha</i> त into म by [[8.2.42]]. Thus नध् + त = नध् + ध [[8.2.40]] नद्धम् [[8.4.53]] But had the substitute been द, we should have नद् + त = नन्नं by [[8.2.42]].
