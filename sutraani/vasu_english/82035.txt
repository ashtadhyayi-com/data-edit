For the ह of the root आह् there is substituted थ before a झल् (all consonant except semi-vowels and nasals) letter.
As इदमात्थ, किमात्थ ॥ The word आथ्थ becomes आत्थ by [[8.4.55]]. Why has the last mentioned substitute ध not been ordained here, for this ध would also have given the form आत्थ by चर change, as the थ is also changed to त; and by so doing there would have been only one <i>sutra</i>, instead of two i.e. आहनहो र्ध would have been enough? Making this separate substitute, is for the sake of indicating that the rule [[8.2.40]], does not apply here. For had [[8.2.40]], still applied, the substitute ध of the last <i>sutra</i> would have been enough. The त substitute, however, would have been the best.

The word झलि is understood here. Hence there is no change before vowel affixes, as आह, आहतुः, आहुः ॥

Vart:- In the <i>Chhandas</i>, भ is substituted for the ह of हृ and ग्रह ॥ Thus गर्दभेन संभरति; मरुदस्य गृभ्णाति; सामिधेन्यो जभ्रिरे, उद्ग्राभञ्च निग्राभञ्च ब्रह्म देवा अवीवृधन् ॥
