For the letters 1. ब 2. ग 3. ड or 4. द in the beginning of a mono-syllable and belonging to a root, and which ends in 1. झ 2. भ 3. घ 4. ढ or 5. ध there is substituted 1. भ 2. घ 3. ढ or 4. ध respectively before स् or ध्व or at the end of a word.
Thus from बुध् - भोत्स्यन्ते, अभुध्वम् and अर्थभुत्; from गुह् - नि घोक्ष्यते न्यघुढ्वम्, पर्णघुट् ॥ गुह् becomes गुढ् by [[8.2.31]], and thus it is a root ending in, <i>jhash</i>. From दुह् - (which becomes दुघ् by [[8.2.32]], and thus is a <i>jhash</i> ending root) धोक्ष्यते, अदुग्ध्वम्, गोधुक् ॥

So also from गृध् we have अजर्घाः the 2nd Person Singular Imperfect (लङ्) Intensive (<i>yan</i> <i>luk</i>). There is <i>guna</i> of ऋ, the स् (of सिप् 2nd Person Singular) is elided [[6.1.68]], and we have अजर्गर्ध्, and for the letter ग of the monosyllabic root, घ is substituted by the present aphorism. अजर्घर्ध् ॥ Then the final ध् is changed to द्, अजर्घर्द् [[8.2.39]]. Then द् is changed to र् by [[8.2.75]]. अजर्घर्र् ॥ Then the first र् is elided अजर्घर् [[8.3.14]]. Then there is lengthening by [[6.3.111]], and we have अजर्घाः ॥

The monosyllable should be such that it should begin with a षश् and end with a झष् letter, and should be a full root or the portion (अवयव) of a root. In fact, this word which we found necessary in [[8.2.32]], is absolutely necessary here, in order to explain forms like गर्धप् from the Denominative root गर्दभय, by former क्विप् ॥

Why do we say "a monosyllable beginning with बश् and ending with झष् ?" Observe दामलिट् from the Denominative root दामलिह्म ॥ For had एकाचः not been employed in the <i>sutra</i>, the word धातोः [[8.2.32]] would have qualified बशः and the <i>sutra</i> would have meant "in a root which ended in a <i>jhash</i>, and which contained a बश् letter as its member; there is <i>jhash</i> substitution for such बश्", and the द of दामलिह would be changed then.

Why do we say "for a बश् letter"? Observe क्रुध् — क्रोत्स्यति here क is not changed to ष ॥ Why do we say ending in <i>jhash</i>? Observe दास्यति ॥ Why before स and ध्व? Observe बोद्धा, बोद्धुम्, बोद्धव्यम् ॥

Why have we taken ध्व and not merely ध? Observe दादद्धि from दध् in the यङ् लुक्, Imperative 2nd Person singular, the हि being changed to धि [[6.4.101]]. The substitutes are four भ, घ, ड and ध, and their respective <i>sthanins</i> are also four, i. e. ब, ग, ड and द; so that ढ is the substitute of ड; but, as a matter of fact, ड never so stands at the beginning of a monosyllable, and so there is no ढ substitution.
