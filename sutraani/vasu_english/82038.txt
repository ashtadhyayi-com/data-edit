For the द of दध (the reduplicated form of धा) is substituted ध before the affixes beginning with त, थ, स and before ध्वम्।
The word दध is taken in the <i>sutra</i> as the reduplicated form of धा दधाति and not the root दध धारणे of <i>Bhuadi</i> class, as शप् intervenes there. By the word च we draw in the words स and ध्व ॥ Thus धत्तः, धत्थः, धत्स, धत्स्व, धध्वम् ॥ By the express injunction of this <i>sutra</i>, the elided अ is not considered as <i>sthanivat</i>. The last <i>sutra</i> could not have applied to दध for two reasons. Ist. It does not begin with a बश् letter, for the real reduplicate is धध, and ह is merely a substitute, and is considered <i>asiddha</i>. 2ndly. The form दध does not end in a <i>jhash</i> consonant, but in a vowel अ, and though this अ is elided before these affixes, yet the <i>lopa</i> would be <i>sthanivat</i>. Hence the necessity of च in this <i>sutra</i>. See coutra, the <i>vartika</i> in <i>Mahabhashya</i>.

The word झलि is understood here, and so also झषन्तस्य; and there can be no affix, but begins with त or थ, that can come after दध् ॥ Why do we employ then the words 'before त and थ'? Had we not used these, the <i>sutra</i> would have referred to स and ध्व only, as being in immediate proximity, and the च draws them in. According to <i>Padamanjari</i> the words तथोश्च could have been dispensed with: for before स् and ध्व, the ध change would have taken place by the last <i>sutra</i>, whilst by this <i>sutra</i>, the same change would have taken place before all other झल्-beginning affixes, and such affixes that can come after दध् are त or थ-beginning affixes.

The word <i>jhash</i> is understood here also, therefore the rule applies to दध then only, when it assumes the form of दध्, by the elision of आ; and hence not here दधाति ॥
