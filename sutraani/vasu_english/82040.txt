ध is substituted for त or थ coming after झष् (झ, भ, घ, ढ, ध) but not after the root धा (दध).
Thus from लभ् we have लब्धा, लब्धुम्, लब्धव्यम्, अलब्ध, अलब्धाः ॥

The भ् of लभ् is changed to ब by [[8.4.53]]. From द्य्ह् — दोग्धा, दोग्धुम्, दोग्धव्यम्, अदुग्ध, अदुग्धाः ॥ The ह is changed to घ by [[8.2.32]], and then it is changed to ग by [[8.4.53]].

From लिह :- लेढा, लेढुम्, लेढव्यम्, अलीढ, अलीढाः ॥ In लेढ्धृ &c, the ह्, is changed to ढ by [[8.2.31]], and ध changed to ढ by [[8.4.41]], before which the preceding ढ is elided by [[8.3.13]].

From बुध् :- बोद्धा, बोद्धुम्, बोद्धव्यम्, अबुद्ध, अबुद्धाः ॥ For the  ध of बुध् there is substituted द by [[8.4.53]].

Why do we say "but not after the root धा"? Observe धत्तः धत्थः ॥
