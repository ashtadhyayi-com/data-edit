After र and द for the त of the Participial suffix त and तवत् there is substituted न and the same substitution takes place also for the preceding द।
After र :- आस्तीर्णम्, विस्तीर्णम्, विशीर्णम्, निगीर्णम्, अवगूर्णम् ॥

After द :- भिन्नः, भिन्नवान्, छिन्नः, छिन्नवान् from भिद् and छिद् ॥ 

Why do we say "after र and द"? Observe कृतः, कृतवान् ॥ The word र here does not denote the common sound र, which would include ऋ also, but the consonant र ॥ But even if र् be taken a common sound-name including र् and ऋ, yet the न् change does not take place in कृत &c, because between त and the र्-sound, there intervenes vowel-sound इ, for ऋ is sounded not like pure र्, but र् + a vowel sound.

Why do we say "of the Participial suffix"? Observe कर्त्ता, हर्त्ता ॥

Why do we say "for the त"? Observe चरितम्, हरितम् ॥ Here the त of the <i>Nishtha</i> does not follow immediately after र्, the augment इट् intervenes.

Why do we say "of the preceding"? The succeeding द will not be changed. As भिन्नवद्भ्याम्, भिन्नवद्भिः ॥

In the word कार्तिः the descendant of कृतः the त of <i>Nishtha</i> is immediately preceded by र्, but no change has taken place, because the <i>Vriddhi</i>, by which कृ is changed to कार्, is <i>Bahiranga</i> and consequently <i>asiddha</i>, and for the purposes of न change, the र् so obtained is invalid.
