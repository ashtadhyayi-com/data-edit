The निष्ठा त is changed to न after श्यै but not when the participle denotes 'cold'.
Thus शीनं घृतम्, शीनो मेदः, शीना वसा; but शीतं वर्तते, शीतो वायुः, शीतमुदकम् ॥ The य् of श्या is vocalised to ई by [[6.1.24]].

The prohibition applies when the noun is an adjective and means 'cold'; and not when it means a disease. Therefore we have प्रतिशीनः with न change.

The word स्पर्श is a <i>guna</i> word formed by घञ्, and denotes the particular <i>guna</i> or sensation to be sensed through the organ of touch. In this sense it is derived from the root स्पृश संस्पर्शने ॥ It also denotes a disease, derived from स्पर्श उपतापे ॥ There is nothing to show, what स्पर्श is meant in the <i>sutra</i>. Explanation is the only refuge here.
