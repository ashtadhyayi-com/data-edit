The निष्ठा त is changed to न after दिव् when the sense is not that of 'play'.
The word विजिगीषा means "desire of conquest or gain", but here it means "gambling".

Thus आद्यूनः, = औदरिकः, परिद्यूनः क्षीणः ॥ Why do we say. "when it does not mean to play"? Observe द्यूतं वर्तते ॥ Here the throwing of dice is with the desire of winning or gaining victory (<i>vijigisha</i>) over the opponent.
