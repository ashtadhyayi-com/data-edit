The word निर्वाण is irregularly formed by changing the निष्ठा त is changed to न when the sense is not that of 'wind'.
The word निर्वाण is formed from the root वा, with the preposition निर् and the Participial affix त ॥ Thus निर्वाणोऽग्निः = उपशान्तः, निर्वाणः प्रदीपः, निर्वाणो भिक्षुः = उपरतः ॥

Why do we say when not meaning "the wind"? Observe, निर्वातो वातः, निर्वातं वातेन ॥

In the sentences निर्वाणः प्रदीपो वातेन, निर्वाणोऽग्निर्वातेन, the न change has taken place, because the location of the verb वा is in the प्रदीप and अग्नि, and not in the वात, which is merely an Instrument. Hence the above <i>vritti</i> uses the words "if the sense of the verb वा does not govern वात in the locative case".
