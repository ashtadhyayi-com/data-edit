म is optionally substituted for the निष्ठा त after the root स्तयै preceded by प्र।
Thus प्रस्तीमः or प्रस्तीतः, प्रस्तीमवान् or प्रस्तीतवान् ॥ In the second alternative when म does not come, we first vocalise the root स्त्या into स्ती, and then add त ॥ Had <i>samprasarana</i> not taken place first, then the <i>Nishtha</i> त would have been changed to म after स्त्या by [[8.2.43]]. But when <i>samprasarana</i> is once made, the root no longer has a semi-vowel and so there remains no occasion for the application of [[8.2.43]]. See [[6.1.23]] for vocalisation.
