The irregularly formed participle वित्त denotes 'possessions' and 'renowned'.
This is derived from विद्लृ लाभे of <i>Tudadi</i> class, the त is not changed to न though so required by [[8.2.42]].

Thus वित्तमस्य बहु = धनमस्य बहु 'he has much riches'. Because riches are enjoyed (भुज्यते), so they are called भोग or 'enjoyments' par excellence.

In the sense of 'renowned', we have वित्तोऽयं मनुष्यः "this man is renowned or famous". Here वित्तः = प्रतीतः ॥ प्रतयिते = प्रत्ययः ॥

Why do we say when having the sense of 'possessions' and 'famous'? Observe विन्नः ॥
