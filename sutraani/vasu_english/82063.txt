The final नश् at the end of a word is optionally changed to guttural.
The word पदस्य is understood here also. As सा वै जीवनडाहुतिः (<i>Maitr</i>. <i>Samhita</i>. I.4.13): or सा वै जीवनगाहुतिः ॥ According to Pro. Bohtlingk this latter form is not found in the <i>Samhita</i>.

Here the root नश has taken क्विप् in denoting 'condition or state'; by considering it as belonging to संपदादि class.

जीवस्य नाशः = जीवनक् or जीवनट् ॥ The gutturalisation optionally debars the ष change of [[8.2.36]]. When the ष change takes place, this ष is changed to ट् by [[8.2.39]] and [[8.4.56]].
