न is substituted, at the end of a word, for the final म of a root.
As प्रशान्, प्रतान्, प्रदान् ॥ These are formed by adding क्विप् to the roots शम्, तम् and दम् ॥ The lengthening takes place by [[6.4.15]]. The न् being considered as <i>asiddha</i> is not elided.

Why do we say "of म-ending roots"? Observe भित्, छित् ॥

Why do we say "of a root"? Observe इदम्, किम् ॥

The word पदस्य is understood here also. So we have प्रतामौ, प्रतामः where म is not at the end of a word.
