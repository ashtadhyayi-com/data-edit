न is substituted for the म of a root before the affixes beginning with म and व।
As अगन्म, अगन्व the Imperfect of गम्, as in the sentence अगन्म तमसः पारम् ॥ The शप् is elided as a Vedic diversity. So also जगन्वान् with क्वसु, the augment इट् is not added by the option allowed, owing to [[7.1.68]]. This <i>sutra</i> applies to those cases where the म is not at the end of a word, as it was in the last <i>sutra</i>.
