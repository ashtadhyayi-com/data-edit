रु is also substituted for the न् of अहन् at the end of a word.
Thus अहोभ्याम्, अहोभिः ॥ The sutra exhibits the form अहन् without the elision of न्, in order to indicate that there is not elision of न् ॥ As दीर्घाहो, निदाघः, हे दीर्घाहोऽत्रेति ॥ See <i>Vartika</i> to [[8.2.7]]. The न् of अहन् is not changed to र् in the <i>sutra</i> by [[8.2.69]], because it is intended to show the word-form अहन् ॥ The Nominal stem is <i>Pada</i> in the above examples by [[1.4.17]].

Vart:- Before the words रूप, रात्रि and रथन्तर, the न् of अहन् is changed to र् ॥ As अहोरूपम्, अहोरात्रः, अहोरथन्तरं साम ॥ This is an exception to [[8.2.69]]. Others say, that this र् change takes place universally before all words beginning with र; as अहो रम्यम्, अहो रत्नानि ॥
