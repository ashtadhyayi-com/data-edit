The short इ or उ is lengthened, when the verb has र् or व् as its penultimate letter and is followed by a consonant.
The <i>anuvritti</i> of हलि is current. The root must end in a consonant, and must have a र् or व् as preceding such consonant, for the application of this rule. Thus हूर्छा, हूर्छिता, मूर्छा, मूर्छिता, तूर्वी, तूर्विता, धूर्वी, धूर्विता ॥

The र् or व् must be followed by a consonant. Therefore not here: as, चिरि, जिरि are roots having a penultimate र, which however is followed by a vowel. Therefore we have चिरिणोति, जिरिणोति ॥

Question:- Why there is not lengthening in रिर्यतुः, रिर्युः or विव्यतुः, विव्युः Perfect, forms derived from the roots रि गतौ and वी गतौ &c? Here the इ of the <i>abhyasa</i> required lengthening, and it would not be shortened, as it is <i>asiddha</i>.

Answer:- The यण् substitute of इ here by [[6.4.82]], is treated as <i>sthanivat</i>, to इ, and therefore, the र् or व् is considered as not to be followed by a consonant, and hence there is no lengthening. Another reason is, that the यण् substitute is taught in <i>angadhikara</i> [[6.4.82]], and depends upon the affix, and is consequently <i>Bahiranga</i>, with regard to this rule of lengthening which is <i>antaranga</i>. Hence यणादेशः is considered as <i>asiddha</i>. Therefore र् and व् are not followed by a consonant (for य् is not considered as such for the above reasons).

Similarly in चतुर्यितृ formed with तृच् affix from the Denominative (क्यच्) root चतुर्य ॥ Here इट् is added before तृच् as चतुर्य + इ + तृ and then अ is elided, चतुर्य् + इ + तृ ॥ Here the elision of अ is a <i>Bahiranga</i> process, and therefore, र् is not here really penultimate, and so there is no lengthening of the vowel.

In प्रतिदीव्ना (Instrumental singular) there is lengthening by [[8.2.77]]. To the root प्रति-दिव् is added कनिन् by <i>Unadi</i> I.156, and we have प्रतिदिवन् ॥ To this is added टा (Instrumental affix), as प्रतिदिवन् + आ, and अ is elided by [[6.4.134]], and we get प्रतिदीव्ना ॥ The lengthening takes place here, the elision of अ is not considered here as <i>sthanivat</i>, and so व् becomes penultimate. In fact, here we apply the maxim that a <i>lopa</i> substitute of a vowel is not to be considered as <i>sthanivat</i> when a rule of lengthening is to be applied (See [[1.1.58]]).

Question:- Well, let it not be <i>sthanivat</i>, but the elision by [[6.4.134]], depends upon a case-affix, and is <i>Bahiranga</i>, and therefore <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of this rule which is <i>antaranga</i>: and so therefore, there would be no lengthening?

Answer:- The maxim of असिद्ध बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्ग should not be applied here: because it is an <i>anitya</i> rule.

The word जिव्रिः is formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affix क्रिन् added to the root वॄ (जिर्), the र् being changed to व (<i>Unadi</i> V. 49). So also किरिः and गिरिः are formed by the <i>Unadi</i> affix कि added to कॄ and गॄ (<i>Unadi</i> IV. 143). The Genitive Dual of which is किर्योः and गिर्योः ॥ There is no lengthening in जिव्रिः, किर्योः and गिर्योः, on the maxim that the <i>Unadi</i> formed words are primitive words and not Derivative; and so the rules of etymological changes do not apply to them (उणादयोऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि) ॥
