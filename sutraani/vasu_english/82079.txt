The lengthening of a vowel does not take place under हलि च [[8.2.77]] when the nominal अङ्ग (stem) ending in र् or व् is called भ (i.e. when a य् follows) and also not in कुर् and छुर्।
Thus धुर्यः (धुरं वहति [[4.4.77]] or धुरि साधुः) ॥ Similarly कुर्यात्, छुर्यात् ॥ The latter is Benedictive of छुर् छेदने ॥  

Why have we qualified the word भ by saying that it must end in र् or व्? Observe प्रतिदीव्ना, प्रतिदीव्ने ॥ For here the stem which ends in व् is not-<i>Bha</i>, and the stem which is <i>Bha</i> does not end in व् but in न् ॥
