The final vowel of a sentence becomes प्लुत and acutely accented (उदात्त) when used in calling a person from a distance.
The word दूरात् is in the Fifth case by [[2.3.35]]; the word  हूतं means 'calling', 'addressing'. Thus आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्ता ३ ॥ आगच्छ भो माणवक यज्ञदत्ता ३ ॥ The word 'distance' is a relative term, and is not fixed at what distance there should be prolation. The prolation however takes place, when a voice is to be raised, in order that the sound may reach the person. That distance upto which the voice can be heard without raising its pitch and without any special effort, need not be considered as "distance" for the purposes of this <i>sutra</i>.

The word हूत here includes, 'addressing in general', and not only 'calling'. Thus there is prolation here also सक्तून् पिब देवदत्ता ३, पलायस्व देवदत्ता ३ ॥ This <i>pluta</i> sentence becomes <i>eka</i>-<i>sruti</i> by [[1.2.33]].

Why do we say "from a distance"? Observe आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्त !

<i>Ishti</i>:- This prolation takes place only then, when the noun in the vocative case stands at the end of the sentence. Therefore, there is no prolation here देवदत्त आगच्छ ॥
