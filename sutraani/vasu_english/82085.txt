When the words है and हे are used in addressing a person from a distance, there the है and हे alone get the प्लुत and the accent.
As है ३ देवदत्त, देवदत्त है ३ ॥ हे ३ देवदत्त, देवदत्त हे ३ ॥

The repetition of the words है and हे in the <i>sutra</i>, is for the sake of indicating, that the prolation takes place even when है and हे do not stand at the end of a sentence.
