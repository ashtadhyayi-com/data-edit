The last vowel at the end of मन्त्र-s called याज्य , when used in sacrificial works is प्लुत and has the acute accent (उदात्त).
Thus स्तोमैर्विधेमाग्नये३ (<i>Rig</i>. VIII.43. II), जिह्वामग्ने चकृषे हव्यवाहा३म् (<i>Rig</i>. X. 8.6).

Why do we say 'at the end'? There are some <i>Yajya</i> hymns, consisting of several sentences. The final vowel (टि) of every sentence would have become <i>pluta</i>, in such a hymn. To prevent it, the word "<i>anta</i>" is used, so that the final vowel of the hymn at the end of all, becomes <i>pluta</i>.
