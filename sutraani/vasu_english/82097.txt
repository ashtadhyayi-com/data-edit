The end syllable of those sentences is प्लुत which denote acts of reflection (or balancing between two alternatives).
To determine a thing by weighing all arguments pro and con is called <i>vichara</i> or judgment. Thus होतव्यं दीक्षितस्य गृहा ३ इ न होतव्या꣡३म् "should one perform sacrifice in the house of an initiated person". Similarly तिष्ठेद्यूपा३इ, अनुप्रहरेद्यूपा३इ ॥ Here also it is being reflected upon whether यूपे तिष्ठेत् or यूपे अनुप्रहरेत् ॥ i. e. should the stake remain upright or should it be put flat by the <i>yajamana</i>. किं यूपस्तिष्ठेत्, किं वा यूपं यजमानः शाययेत् ॥
