The end syllable of the sentence which expresses assent or promise or listening to, is प्लुत।
The word प्रतिश्रवण means "agreement, assent or promise": It also means "listening to". All these senses are to be taken here, as there is nothing in the <i>sutra</i> to restrict its scope. Thus it has three senses, 1. to promise something to a petitioner, 2. to acknowledge the truth of some proposition, 3. to listen to another's words. Thus गां मे देहि भोः, 1. हन्त ते ददामि꣡ ३ ॥ 2. नित्यः शब्दो भवितुमर्हति꣡ ३ ॥ 3. देवदत्त भोः, किमात्या꣡ ३ ॥
