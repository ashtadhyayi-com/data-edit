In both ways in the ऋग् verses.
This ordains an option to the last <i>sutra</i>, by which the रु substitution was compulsory. A word ending in म् followed by a letter of छव् class, which itself is followed by अम्, changes its final म् to र् optionally in the <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>. Sometimes there is र् and sometimes म् ॥ Thus तस्मिन् त्वा दधाति or तस्मिँस् त्वा दधाति; पशूँस्ताँश्चक्रे ॥

Why do we say "in the <i>Rig</i> verses". No option is allowed here ताँस्त्व खाद सुखादिताम् ॥
