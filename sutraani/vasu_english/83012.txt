रु is substituted for the न् of कान् when it is followed by another कान् which is an अम्रेडित (repeated).
The <i>sutra</i> might have been कान् कानि; but the use of the longer form आम्रेडिते shows, that where there is 'doubling', and the word gets the designation of <i>amredita</i>, then the rule applies. Thus काँस्कान् आमन्त्रयते, काँस्कान् भोजयति; or कांस्कान् &c. When the second कान् is not an <i>amredita</i>, we have कान् कान् पश्यति? Here one is किं asking question, and the other is used in the sense of contempt. This word is read in the list of कस्कादि [[8.3.48]], and hence <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.37]], does not apply. Or the स् of समः स्सुटि [[8.3.5]], is understood here, and that स् is enjoined here and not  रु ॥ It should not be objected that in the preceding <i>sutras</i> also स् should be enjoined and not रु; because in those <i>sutras</i> रु is appropriate but not so here.

Why do we say 'when an <i>amredita</i> follows'? Observe कान् कान् पश्यति where one is interrogatory and the other denotes contempt [[2.1.64]].
