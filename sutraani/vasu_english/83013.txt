There is elision of ढ् when ढ् follows.
Though this <i>sutra</i> is read in the division of Grammar which is governed by पदाधिकार, yet this elision takes place only then when the ढ is not at the end of a <i>pada</i>. Thus लीढ from लिह् + त ॥ The ह is changed to  ढ by [[8.2.31]], and the त is first changed to ध by [[8.2.40]], and then to ढ by [[8.4.41]]. Thus लिढ् + ढ ॥ The first ढ् is elided by this <i>sutra</i>. Similarly मीढम्, उपगूढम् ॥ The change of ध into ढ by [[8.4.41]], should be considered as valid and <i>siddha</i> for the purposes of this rule, otherwise this rule will find no scope.

Objection:- It will find scope before that ढ which is primary, as in श्वलिढ् + ढौकते, where ढ of ढौकते is primary.

Answer:- No. Here the first ढ will be changed to ड् by जश् rule [[8.2.39]] and so there will be no occasion to elide it. The form will be श्वलिड् ढौकते ॥ Nor is this ढ लोपः rule an <i>apavada</i> to जश्त्व rule, because it has its scope in लीढ &c. For the जश् rule depends upon one <i>pada</i>, and is <i>antaranga</i>, or being prior to this the <i>lopa</i> is <i>asiddha</i> with regard to it. Therefore जश्त्व will take place first. Moreover in लिढ् + ढ to there is similarity of sounds (श्रुतिकृतं आनन्तर्यम्); though there may not be theoretical similarity (शास्त्रकृतं आनन्तर्यम्) when the change of ध into ढ by [[8.4.41]], is considered <i>asiddha</i>. But this theoretical technical dissimilarity will be removed by the express text of the present <i>sutra</i>. But in श्वलिड् ढौकते there is neither similarity of sounds (<i>sruti</i> <i>krtamanantaryam</i>) between ड् and ढ्, nor similarity created by any technical rule; therefore ढ लोप has no scope here. It is <i>Bahiranga</i> as well as subsequent to जश् rule [[8.2.39]], and therefore doubly <i>asiddha</i>; and consequently it does not debar the जश् rule. So when ढ् is changed to ड् by जश् rule [[8.2.39]] in श्वलिड्, then there remains no sort of <i>anantarya</i>-neither of <i>sruti</i> nor of <i>sastra</i>.
