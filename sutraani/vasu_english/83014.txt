There is elision of र् when र् follows.
The <i>sutra</i> is रः रि, and not रोः रि ॥ That is रो रि is the form which रः रि and रोः रि will both assume. रः is the Genitive of र्, and रोः would be the Genitive of रु ॥ The <i>sutra</i> is not confined to रु only, but to every र् in general including रु ॥ Thus नीरक्तम्, दूरक्तम्, where it is simple र् of निर् and दुर्; and अग्नी रथः, and इन्दू रथः where it is रु (अग्निः रथः, इन्दुः रथः). The lengthening is by [[6.3.111]]. The word पदस्य is understood here, and the Genitive here has the force of विशेषण i. e. a quality, or <i>avayava</i>-<i>shashthi</i>; i. e. when रेफ is a portion of the <i>pada</i>. Thus a रेफ which is not at the end of a <i>pada</i> is also elided. Had the Genitive been construed as <i>sthana</i>-<i>shashthi</i>, then रेफ would qualify पद, and the rule would mean "र् should be elided before a र् when at the end of a word." See [[8.1.16]]. But we have the elision of the penultimate र् in अजर्घर्र् the second person singular of the Imperfect of the Intensive, and we get the form अजर्घाः ॥ See [[8.2.37]]. So also अपास्पाः from स्पर्ध in Intensive, Imperfect. The reduplicate is lengthened by [[7.4.83]], the शप् is elided, and सिप् is elided by [[6.1.68]], the final ध् is changed to द् by [[8.2.39]], and this द् changed to र् by [[8.2.75]].
