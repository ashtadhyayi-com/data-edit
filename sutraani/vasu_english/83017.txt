य् is substituted for the रु called र (and not any other र) when it is preceded by 1. भो 2. भगो 3. अघो 4. अ or 5. आ before an अश् letter (vowels and soft-consonants).
Thus भो अत्र, भगो अत्र, अघो अत्र, भो ददाति, भगो ददाति, अघो ददाति ॥ क आस्ते, कय् आस्ते, ब्राह्मणा ददाति, पुरुषा ददाति ॥ The य् is elided by [[8.3.19]], [[8.3.20]], [[8.3.22]] &c. With य, the forms will be भोयत्र, भगोयत्र, अघोयत्र ॥

Why do we say 'when preceded by भो &c'? Observe अग्निरत्र, वायुरत्र ॥ Why do we say 'when followed by a letter of अश् <i>pratyahara</i>'? Observe वृक्षः, प्लक्षः ॥ No, this is no valid counter-example, because no other word follows the <i>visarga</i>; while some word must follow it because the word <i>sanhita</i> [[8.2.108]] is understood here.

Answer:- If this be so, then अश् is employed in this <i>sutra</i> for the sake of subsequent <i>sutras</i>. Its employment here is superfluous. For letters other than अश् are खर् ॥ Before a खर् letter, the र् will be changed to <i>visarga</i> by [[8.3.15]]; and the यत्व of this rule will be considered as <i>asiddha</i> for the purposes of [[8.3.15]], so there will necessarily be <i>visarga</i>. Thus अश् serves no purpose in this <i>sutra</i>, but is for the sake of subsequent ones. Thus in [[8.3.22]], the word हलि must be qualified by the word अश्, namely those consonants only which are in the class अश् ॥ Before any other consonant there will be no elision of य ॥ Thus वृक्षं वृश्चति = वृक्षवृट् ॥ The denominative verb from this will be वृक्षवयति ॥ A secondary derivative from this root, with the affix विच् will be वृक्षव् as in वृक्षव् करोति ॥ Here व् would require elision by [[8.3.22]], before क्, but it is not so because अशि qualifies हलि ॥

Objection:- If so, why is the word हल् used in that <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.22]], it would have been better to say हशि सर्वेषाम् instead of हलि सर्वेषाम् ॥

Answer:- The word हल् is used in that <i>sutra</i> for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.23]], which applies to all consonants. Had हशि been used in [[8.3.22]], then in [[8.3.23]], हलि ought to have been used.

Moreover अशि is used in this <i>sutra</i>, so that rules [[8.3.18]], [[8.3.19]] may not apply to वृक्षव् करोति ॥

This <i>sutra</i> applies to रु called र्, therefore not here प्रातरत्र, पुनरत्र ॥
