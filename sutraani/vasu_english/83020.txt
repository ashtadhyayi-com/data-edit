य् preceded by ओ is elided before an अश् letter (vowels and soft-consonants) according the opinion of गार्ग्य ।
There can be no व् preceded by ओ, so only य् is taken in explaining the <i>sutra</i>. Thus भो अत्र, भगो अत्र, भो इदम्, भगो इदम् ॥

The making of it a separate <i>sutra</i>, is for the sake of indicating that this is a necessary (<i>nitya</i>) rule and not a <i>vibhasha</i> rule. The name of <i>Gargya</i> is used simply honoris causa (<i>pujartha</i>). The elision of <i>laghu</i>-<i>prayatna</i> य्, which [[8.3.19]] would have otherwise caused, is hereby prohibited. So that
<i>laghu</i> <i>pratyatnatara</i> य् does come also. As भो अत्र or भोयत्र, भगो अत्र or भगोयत्र, अघो अत्र and अघोयत्र ॥

According to others every kind of य् (whether heavy or light) is to be elided: and भोयत्र is not valid in their opinion.
