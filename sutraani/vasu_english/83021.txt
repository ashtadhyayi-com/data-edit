व् and य् (preceded by अ or आ and the end of a पद) and followed by उ , when it is a word, are elided necessarily.
The particle उ is a full <i>pada</i> or word. That Particle is meant here by the word उञ्, and not the उञ्, which is a root obtained by the <i>samprasarana</i> of वेञ् ॥ Thus स उ एकविंशतिः, स उ एकाग्निः ॥

Why do we use the word पदे "उ when it is a <i>pada</i>"? So that the rule may not apply to उञ् the form assumed by वेञ् by <i>samprasarana</i> as तन्त्रे उतं = तन्त्रयुतम् ॥ Objection:- उञ् could never have meant the form assumed by वेञ्, for the <i>samprasarana</i> of वेञ् is उ, the ञ् is merely indicatory. Moreover the maxim of <i>lakshana</i>-<i>pratipadokta</i> &c, will prevent the inclusion of this उञ् resulting from vocalisation, when there is a separate Particle उञ् ॥

Answer:- The word पदे is used here for the sake of the subsequent <i>sutras</i> like [[8.3.32]]. So that ङ्मुट् may come before a word beginning with a vowel, and not before a vowel which is an affix. Thus there is no double in न् in परमदण्डिना ॥ This is also a <i>nitya</i> rule, and not optional. Had it been optional, there would have been no necessity of this aphorism, because [[8.3.19]], would have been enough.
