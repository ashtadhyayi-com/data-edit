(The य् when preceded by 1. भो 2. भगो 3. अघो 4. अ or 5. आ , is elided) before a consonant according to the opinion of all आचार्रचा-s.
Thus भो हसति, भगो हसति, अघो हसति; भो याति, भगो याति अघो याति, वृक्षा हसन्ति ॥ Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of व् and य् both is present here, yet we have taken य only to the exclusion of व् ॥ Because भो, भगो and अघो there is य् only, and never व्; and व् can come only when preceded by अ or आ : the only example of which given by Grammarians is वृक्षव् करोति [[8.3.17]]. Here व् is not elided, because the word अशि qualifies the word हलि of this <i>sutra</i>.

Question:- But व् should be elided in वृक्षव् हसति, because ह is an अश् letter.

Answer:- There is no such example to be found in any standard author. Moreover <i>Patanjali</i> in his commentary on the <i>Pratyahara</i> <i>sutra</i> लण् says that no words can end in ह्, य्, र्, व् or ल् ॥ So that the existence of the very word वृक्षव् is doubtful.

The word <i>sarvesham</i> indicates that [[8.3.18]], even does not apply, and there is no light articulation, but <i>lopa</i> there too.
