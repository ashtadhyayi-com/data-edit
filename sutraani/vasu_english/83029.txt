After a word ending in ड् there may optionally be added the augment ध् to a word beginning with स्।
Thus श्वलिट् त्साये or श्वलिट् साये, or मधुलिट् त्साये or मधुलिट् साये ॥

The word डः is to be construed as Ablative singular, and not Genitive singular of ड्, because of the maxim उभयनिर्देशे पञ्चमी निर्देशो बलीयान् ॥

Question:- Why it is धुट् and not धुक्, in other words, why is this augment added to the beginning of the second word and not to the end of the first ?

Answer:- This is done in order to prevent the ष्टु change by [[8.4.41]]. But being at the beginning of the second word, [[8.4.42]] would prevent this change. श्वलिट्त् + साये = श्वलिट्ट्साये, [[8.4.41]] but the correct form is श्वलिट् त्साये ॥ For the ह of श्वलिह् is ढ substituted by [[8.2.31]], which becomes ड् by [[8.2.39]], for the ध of the augment, त is substituted by [[8.4.55]], and for ड् there is ट् by the same rule.
