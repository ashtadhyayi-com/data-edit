The augment त् may optionally be added to a word ending in न् , when a word beginning with श् follows.
Thus भवाञ् च्छेते ॥ The augment is added to the end of the preceding word, and not to the beginning of the second word, in order to change श into छ ॥ In fact, the augment धुट् added to the second would have been as good as तुक्, namely both are त; but then छ change would not have taken place.

Objection:- If this be so, then why न् is not changed to ण्, since it is no longer final in a <i>pada</i>, when तुक् is added to it, in कुर्वञ् च्छेते ॥  

Answer:- This is to be thus explained. The <i>sutra</i> स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः [[8.4.40]] should be divided into two parts, in order to prevent ण change. Thus the first part will be स्तोः श्चुना, which will mean that स and तु followed by श and चु will not cause the change of न to ण ॥ The next <i>sutra</i> will be श्चुः, which will mean that the preceding  स and तु are changed to श and चु respectively.
