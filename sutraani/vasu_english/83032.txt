After a word ending in ङ् ण् or न् which is preceded by a light vowel, the same consonant ङ् ण् or न् is added invariably at the beginning of the next word, which commences with a vowel.
The word ङमः is in the Ablative singular here; and ह्रस्वात् qualifies ङमः and ङम् itself qualifies the word पदस्य understood, and thus there is <i>tadanta</i>-<i>viddhi</i>. Though the word पदस्य [[8.1.16]] is in the Genitive singular, yet it should be converted here into Ablative singular, because of its connection with ङमः ॥ अचि is in the Locative singular, but should be construed as Genitive singular here : it is exhibited in the 7th case for the sake of brevity, and of the subsequent <i>sutras</i>. ङम् is a <i>pratyahara</i> meaning ङ, ण and न; and so also ङमुट् is a <i>pratyahara</i> containing the three augments ङुट्, णुट् and नुट् ॥

In other words ङ् is augment after ङ्, ण् after ण् and न् after म्; or that these letters are doubled practically. Thus ङुट् is the augment after a word ending in ङ्, as प्रत्यङ्ङास्ते ॥ णुट् is the augment after a word ending in ण्, as वणणास्ते ॥ नुट् is the augment after a word ending in न्, as कुर्वन्नास्ते, कुर्वन्नवोचत्, कृषन्नास्ते, कृषन्नवोचत् ॥

Why do we say 'ending in ङ, ण or न'? See त्वमास्ते ॥ Why do we say 'preceded by a light vowel'? Observe प्राङास्ते, भवानास्ते ॥ Why do we say "followed by a vowel"? Observe प्रत्यङ्करोति ॥

The <i>Mahabhashya</i> thus comments on this aphorism :-

Vart:- ङमुटि पदादिग्रहणम् "The ङमुट् augment is added to a vowel which stands at the beginning of a word". So that in दण्डिन् + आ (Instrumental Singular), नुट् is not added to आ, because it is not the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>. Then should this <i>vartika</i> be held to be necessary? No, because the word पदात् is understood here: so नुट् will not come in दण्डिना ॥ But then it will come in परमदण्डिन् + आ ॥ Because it is a compound of two nouns, and though the case-affixes have been elided, yet दण्डिन् is here a <i>Pada</i> by reason of <i>pratyaya</i> <i>lakshana</i>; and hence there should be नुट् here added to आ ॥ Answer:- This is no valid objection. दण्डिन् is not here a <i>Pada</i>, on the maxim उत्तरपदत्वे चापदादिविधौलुमता लुप्ते प्रत्ययलक्षणं न भवति "When an affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्, the <i>pratyaya</i>-<i>lakshana</i> rule will not apply, when the object of it is to give the designation of <i>Pada</i> to the second member of a compound, with the exception of the rule applying to the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>". Thus in परमदण्डिन् the word दण्डिन् is not treated as a पद, because the rule to be applied is to the end here. But the second member of a compound is treated like a <i>pada</i>, when a rule is to be applied to the beginning of a <i>Pada</i>. Thus in दधिसेचौ, the second member सेच् is considered as a <i>Pada</i> for the purposes of the rule सात् पदाद्योः [[8.3.111]], and the स is not changed to ष ॥ This view proceeds upon the supposition that the word पदात् governs this <i>sutra</i>. But the <i>anuvritti</i> of पदात् ceased with [[8.1.27]], as we stated before. How are we then to get out of this difficulty? Are we to make the above <i>vartika</i> necessary? No: because the <i>anuvritti</i> of पदे from [[8.3.21]] runs into this <i>sutra</i>. So that the <i>sutra</i> means अजादौ पदे ङमुड् भवति ॥ "The augment ङमुट् is added to a vowel with which a <i>Pada</i> commences". Not therefore to the case-affix आ in दण्डिना ॥
