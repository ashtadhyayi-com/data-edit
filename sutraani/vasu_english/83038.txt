स् is the substitute of a विसर्ग before an affix beginning with a hard guttural or labial.
The word अपदादौ means "when the guttural and labial are not at the beginning of a word," in other words, when they stand at the beginning of an affix. This is possible only before the affixes पाश, कल्प, क, and काम्य ॥ Thus पयस्पाशम् [[5.3.47]]; पयस्कल्पम्, यशस्कल्पम्, [[5.3.67]], पयस्कं, यशस्कम्, [[5.3.70]]; पयस्काम्यति, यशस्काम्यति [[3.1.9]].

Why do we say 'when not at the beginning of a word'? Observe पयᳶ कामयते, पयᳶ पिबति ॥

Vart:- Prohibition must be stated, when the <i>visarga</i> belongs to an Indeclinable: as, प्रातः कल्पम्, पुनः कल्पम् ॥

Vart:- The <i>visarga</i> which comes from रु is only changed to स before काम्य, and not any other <i>visarga</i>. As पयस्काम्यात, and यशस्काम्यति; but not here, गीः काम्यति धूः काम्यति ॥

Vart:- स is the substitute of the <i>Upadhmaniya</i> when followed by a guttural. The root उᳶज् (आजवे <i>Tudadi</i> 20) has <i>Upadhmaniya</i> as its penultimate: though it is written in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> as उव्ज the व् only represents the प् of ᳶप, and is not to be pronounced. This ᳶप is changed to स, when the final ज् is changed to a guttural, as उ स ग, and then this स् is changed to द्, as in अभ्युद्गः, समुद्गः ॥

These words, however, may be derived from the root गम with the Prepositions अभि, उत्, and सम् उत्, by adding the affix उ ॥
