ष् is optionally the substitute of the विसर्ग of 1. द्विस् 2. त्रिस् and 3. चतुर् when they are used as numeral adverbs (before a hard guttural or a labial).
The affix सुच् (स्) is added to the three words <i>dvi</i>, <i>tri</i> and <i>chatur</i> in the sense of <i>krtvasuch</i> by [[5.4.18]].

As द्विः करोति or द्विष्करोति, त्रिः करोति or त्रिष्करोति, चतुः करोति or चतुष्करोति, द्विः पचति or द्विष्पचति, त्रिः पचति or त्रिष्पचति, चतुः पचति or चतुष्पचति ॥

Why do we say 'when used in the sense of <i>kritvasuch</i> or Numeral adverbs '? Observe चतुष्कपालम्, चतुष्कण्टकम्, where ष is compulsory by [[8.3.41]]. चतुर्षु कपालेषु संस्कृतः [[4.2.16]] and [[4.1.88]]. This <i>sutra</i> is an example of <i>ubhayatra</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>. With regard to चतुर् the <i>visarga</i> is a non-affix <i>visarga</i>, and hence [[8.3.41]], would have made ष compulsory, this makes it optional. With regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् the <i>visarga</i> is that of an affix (सुच् or स् [[5.4.18]]), and hence [[8.3.41]], would not have applied. Thus with regard to चतुर् it is a <i>Prapta</i>-<i>vibhasha</i>, and with regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् it is an <i>Aprapta</i> <i>vibhasha</i>. 

Why have we used the words '<i>dvis</i>, <i>tris</i> and <i>chatur</i>'? Objector's answer: so that the rule may not apply to पंचकृत्वः करोति, the <i>visarga</i> of <i>kritvasuch</i> [[5.4.17]] is not changed to ष् ॥

The <i>anuvritti</i> of उ and इ is understood here from [[8.3.41]]: so that the <i>visarga</i> must be preceded by इ and उ for the application of this rule. In पञ्चकृत्वः the <i>visarga</i> is preceded by अ, and so there is no applicability of this rule.

In fact, by reading the <i>anuvritti</i> of इदुदुपधा into this <i>sutra</i>, and qualifying the <i>visarga</i> by the further epithet of 'belonging to a word that has the sense of <i>kritvasuch</i>'; we may dispense with the words द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरिति from the <i>sutra</i>. The simple <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोर्थे would have been enough. For there are no other Numerals that have a penultimate इ or उ, except these three. The chief objection to this view is, that in चतुर् the <i>visarga</i> is not the affix सुच्, but a portion of the word (See [[5.4.18]]): so the rule would not apply to <i>chatur</i>, if this word were not expressly mentioned.

The various objections and their solutions are given in the following verses.

कृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्माच्चचतुष्कपाले मा
षत्वं विभाषया भूम्ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥
सिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे ॥
लुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥
एवं सति त्विदानीं द्वित्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥
अन्यो हि नेदुदुपधः कृत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति ॥
अक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत ॥
चतुरो न सिध्यति तथा रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥
तस्मिंस्तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति ॥
प्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि विशेषणं न्याय्यम् ॥

<i>Karika</i>:- कृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्मात्? Why does the author teach षत्व when these words have the sense of Numeral-adverbs? In other words, why the word कृत्वोर्थे is used at all in the <i>sutra</i>? There is no necessity of using it at all, because द्विस्, त्रिस् are clearly adverbs as they are formed by the affix सुच् [[5.4.18]] and चतुर् being read in their company will also denote the adverb <i>chatur</i>, in which सुच् has been elided [[5.4.18]]. So that all these three words are सुच्-formed, and all सुच्-formed words have the sense of <i>Krtvasuch</i>. One answer to this is that the rule of साहचर्य does not always hold good, as in दीधीवेवीटाम् [[1.1.6]], the words दीधी and वेवी are verbs, while इट् is an augment. Though therefore द्विस् and त्रिस् are <i>krtvortha</i> words, yet चतुर् need not be so: and may be a simple Numeral. Answer: चतुष्कपाले मा षत्वं विभाषया भूत् ॥ The word कृत्वोर्थे is employed to indicate that there should be no optional षत्व in चतुष्कपालं ॥ The षत्व here is compulsory by [[8.3.41]]. Question: ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥ Well this would be valid by the previous <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.41]]. That is, let in चतुष्कपाल also there be optional षत्व, as चतुःकपाल and चतुष्कपाल ॥ Now rule [[8.3.41]] will apply to चतुःकपाल and will change this <i>visarga</i> to ष, so that with regard to चतुष्कपाल, we shall have always ष ॥ Answer:- सिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे, लुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि । If [[8.3.41]] be considered as applying here (<i>siddha</i>), then when the affix सुच् is elided after चतुर्, and the र is changed to <i>visarga</i>, then the adverb चतुः also ends with a non-affix <i>visarga</i>, and will come under the compulsory षत्व rule of [[8.3.41]]; for though we may have optionally two forms as चतुः करोति and चतुष्करोति, by the present <i>sutra</i>, yet in the former the <i>visarga</i> would be changed to ष by [[8.3.41]]. Hence the necessity of employing the word कृत्वोर्थे ॥ Question: But we say that the र् in the adverb चतुर् is that of सुच्, thus चतुर् + स् = चतुर् + र् [[8.2.66]] = चतु + र् (the first र् is elided by [[8.3.14]]) = चतुर्; and that this र् when changed to <i>visarga</i>, will be an affix-<i>visarga</i> and so [[8.3.41]] will not apply to the adverb चतुर् ॥ Answer:- No. For उ would require to be lengthened by [[6.3.111]]. and the form would be चतूर् ॥

एवं सति त्विदानीं द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥ If this be so, then what is the purpose served by using the words द्विस् त्रिश्चतुरिति in the aphorism? The simple <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोऽर्थे would have been enough. Because (अन्योहि नेदुदुपधः कुत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति) there are no other numeral adverbs than these three which have a penultimate इ or उ ॥

अक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत । If we do not use the words <i>dvis</i>, <i>tris</i>, <i>chaturiti</i> in the <i>sutra</i>, then the word<i> krtvorthe</i> would qualify the word <i>visarga</i>, and the <i>sutra</i> would mean " the <i>visarga</i> of an affix which has the sense of <i>kritvasuch</i> is changed optionally to ष" ॥ The result of this will be that (चतुरा न सिध्यति तथारेफस्य विसर्जनीयोहि) it will not apply to चतुः where the <i>visarga</i> is that of र् and not of the affix सुच् ॥

Therefore by using <i>dvis</i> &c, the word कृत्वोर्थे would qualify चतुर् (तस्मिन् तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति) ॥

Answer:- प्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि, विशेषणं नाय्यम् ॥ Though we may not use <i>dvis</i> &c, the word <i>krtvortha</i> will not qualify <i>visarga</i>, but will qualify the word पद whose context runs here; and the rule of तदन्त will apply; so that the <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोऽर्थे will mean, पदस्य कृत्वोर्थे वर्त्तमानस्य यो विसर्जनीयः, तस्य सकारः षकारो व ॥ "The <i>visarga</i> of that word which is employed in the sense of a Numeral adverb, is optionally changed to स् or ष् before a guttural or a labial, provided that such <i>visarga</i> is preceded by इ or उ".

The above is the opinion of <i>Patanjali</i>, who considers the words <i>dvis</i> &c, as redundant. The <i>Kasika</i> however controverts this opinion. According to him, if these words were not used in the <i>sutra</i>, then the mere <i>sutra</i> कृत्वोऽर्थे would be insufficient for the <i>visarga</i> of चतुः though used as an adverb, the षत्व will be compulsory by [[8.3.41]]; for the present <i>sutra</i> will be considered as <i>asiddha</i> or non-existent for the purposes of [[8.3.41]], (See [[8.2.1]]). But this however may be answered by saying that the rule of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् applies in these chapters, with this modification, one subject-matter is considered as <i>asiddha</i> with regard to another subject-matter gone before; but one aphorism is not considered <i>asiddha</i> with regard to a previous aphorism, when belonging to the same subject matter. (प्रकरणे प्रकरणमसिद्धं न योगे योगः) ॥ Therefore the present <i>sutra</i> [[8.3.43]], would not be considered <i>asiddha</i> with regard to [[8.3.41]]. Or the present <i>sutra</i> may be considered as an <i>apavada</i> to [[8.3.41]]: and an <i>apavada</i> is never <i>asiddha</i> with regard to an <i>utsarga</i>.
