For the विसर्ग of अधस् or शिरस् when not preceded by another word and followed by the word पद in composition with it, there is substituted स्।
Thus अधस्पदम्, शिरस्पदम् ॥ अधस्पदी, शिरस्पदी ॥

The word समासे is understood in this, therefore not here अधः पदम् ॥

The word अनुत्तरपदस्थस्य is also understood here. Therefore not in the following परमशिरः पदम् ॥

The word अधस्पदम् is a compound formed under <i>Mayuravyansakadi</i> class.
