स् or ष् is substituted for the विसर्ग before a hard guttural or a labial in the words कस्क etc.
This is an <i>Apavada</i> to <i>Sutra</i> [[8.3.37]]. ष् is substituted after इ or उ, and स् everywhere else. Thus कस्कः, 2. कौतस्कुतः (with अण् of कुत आगतः). 3. भ्रातुष्पुत्रः [[6.3.23]] 4. शुनस्कर्णः [[6.3.21]] 5. सद्यस्कालः; 6. सद्यस्क्री (from क्री 'to buy' with the affix क्विप्, because it belongs to <i>Sampadadi</i> class.) 7. साद्यस्क्रः (from सद्यस्क्री in the sense of तत्रभवः क्रतुः). 8. कांस्कान् (the रु is by [[8.3.12]]). 9. सर्पिष्कुण्डिका, 10. चतुष्कपालम्, 11. धनुष्कपालम् 12. बर्हिष्पूलम्, 13. यजुष्पात्रम् ॥ "The words 9 to 13 are exceptions to [[8.3.45]], so that there might be ष, even when सर्पिस् &c are preceded by another word. Thus परमसर्पि ष्कुण्डिका ॥ The counter-example then to [[8.3.45]] will be परमसर्पिः फलम् ॥ "This is the opinion of the <i>Parayanikas</i>. But in the <i>Mahabhashya</i>, the counter-example under [[8.3.45]] is परमसर्पिः कुण्डिका ॥ Another reason why these words are listed here, is that ष change will take place, even where there is no correlation or <i>vyapeksha</i>. As तिष्ठतु सर्पिष्कुण्डिकां आनय ॥ So also when there is correlation, as इदं सर्पिष्कुण्डिकायाः ॥ Here सर्पिस् is an incomplete word. The ष change, will take place even where there is no compounding. Where there is no compounding, and there is complete want of correlation, even there the ष will invariably come. And where there is correlation, but no compounding there the ष would have been optional by [[8.3.44]], but it becomes invariable here, on account of these words being so listed. Thus we have these cases : (1) Without correlation, as तिष्ठतु सर्पिष्कुण्डिकामानय ॥ (2) Where there is correlation, as इदं  सर्पिष्कुण्डिकायाः ॥ (3) Where there is composition, as सर्पिष्कुण्डिका ॥ (4) Where there is no composition and no correlation even, as, in example (1). (5) Where there is correlation but no compounding as in example (2). In all these cases there ष is invariably in case of these words. 14. अयस्काण्डः, 15. मेदस्पिण्डः ॥ अविहितलक्षण उपचारः कस्कादिषु द्रष्टव्यः ।

Every change of <i>visarga</i> to स or ष, must be referred to <i>Kaskadi</i> class, is not governed by any other rule. Thus this is an <i>Akrtigana</i>. <i>Upachara</i> is the name of स् and ष् which replace the <i>visarga</i>.

The <i>Parayana</i> is of two sorts, <i>Dhatu</i>-<i>Par</i>, and <i>Nama</i>-<i>Par</i>. Those who devote themselves in committing to memory and reciting these are <i>Parayanikas</i>.
