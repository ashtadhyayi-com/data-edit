ष् is substituted for the स् in साह when this occurs in the form of साड (साट्).
Thus जलाषाट्, तुराषाट्, पृतनाषाट् ॥ साड् is derived from सह् by the affix ण्वि [[7.2.63]], there is <i>vriddhi</i> of the penultimate, the ह is changed to ढ [[8.2.31]]. and the <i>upapada</i> is lengthened [[6.3.137]].

साढः सः would have been enough, for there is no other form साड् except this derived from सह्; why then the word सहेः is used in the <i>sutra</i>? There is another form साड् not derived from सह् ॥ Thus सह डेन वर्त्तते = सडः, सडस्य अपत्यं = साडिः ॥ He in whose name there is the letter ड is called सड; as मृड ॥

Why do we say 'in the form of साड्'? The rule will not apply when the form is साह, as जलासाहम्, तुरासाहम् ॥ Why do we say सः "for the स"? So that the आ of साड् may not be changed to cerebral : the ड् is already cerebral.
