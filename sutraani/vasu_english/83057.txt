From this, up to the end of the chapter should be supplied, in every sūtra, the following - 'when a vowel (with the exception of अ or आ) or a र् or a guttural precedes'.
The word इण is a <i>pratyahara</i> formed with the second ण् of लण् ॥ It includes all vowels and semivowels excepts अ and आ ॥ Of the semi-vowels र् is only efficient: so that only is taken in the translation. कु means the letters of the क class. Thus इण्कोः is supplied in [[8.3.59]], to complete the sense. Thus सिषेव, सुष्वाप, अग्निषु, वायुषु, कर्तृषु, हर्तृषु, गीर्षु, धूर्षु, वाक्षु, त्वक्षु ॥

Why do we say "when preceded by इण् or कु"? Observe दास्यति, असौ ॥ Here the affix स of स्यति, and the substitute स in असौ [[7.2.106]] are not changed to ष ॥
