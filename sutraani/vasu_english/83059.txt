ष् is substituted for that स् which is a substitute (of the ष् of a root in the धातुपाठ by धात्वादेः षः सः [[6.1.64]]) or which is (the portion of) an affix, under the above mentioned conditions -- इण्कोः [[8.3.57]], नुम्विसर्जनीयशर्व्यवायेऽपि [[8.3.58]], of being preceded by an इण् vowel or a guttural.
The word cerebral is understood here from [[8.3.55]], as well as स ॥ The <i>sutra</i> <i>adesa</i>-<i>pratyayoh</i> is in the Genitive case. The force of the Genitive however is different in the word <i>adesa</i>, from what it is in <i>pratyaya</i>. In the first it is <i>samanadhikarana</i>-<i>shashthi</i>, in the latter <i>avayava</i>-yogashashthi<i>. That is that स् which is an </i>adesa<i>, and that स् which belongs to an affix. If we took it as </i>avayavayoga<i> </i>shashthi<i> in both places, then the </i>sutra<i> would mean "of that स् which is a portion of a substitute, or of an affix," and there would arise the following anomaly. In doubling a word by [[8.1.1]], one view is that two are substituted in the room of one (See [[8.1.1]]). Thus बिसंबिसं, मुसलंमुसलं ॥ Here the स् in these words, is a portion of a substitute, and would be changed to ष्, if we translate the </i>sutra<i> as above.

If we take the other view, and translate the </i>sutra<i> as "of that स् which is a substitute or an affix", we land on the following anomaly. We must have forms like करिस्यति and हरिस्यति, and not the correct forms करिष्यति, हरिष्यति; for here स is not an affix, but a portion of an affix. In fact, with regard to affixes, the </i>sutra<i> would be confined to those affixes only which consist of a single स्, such as सिप् in the Vedic subjunctive लेट् ॥ That this is the proper interpretation of the </i>sutra<i> is indicated by the </i>sutra<i> [[8.3.60]], (the next aphorism). The substitute घस् is taken in this </i>sutra<i>. If therefore, the force of Genitive in आदेशस्य was = आदेशस्य यः सकारः and not = आदेशः यः सकारः, then there would have been no necessity of including the substitute घस् in the </i>sutra<i>, for then the present </i>sutra<i> would have covered the case of घस् also. Similarly, if the force of the Genitive in प्रत्ययस्य was = प्रत्ययः यः सकारः, and not = प्रत्ययस्यः यः सकारः; then there would have been no necessity of excluding the affix सात् [[5.4.52]] from the operation of the present rule by [[8.3.111]], because it is not an affix consisting of a single letter स् ॥

Having surmised this, we shall now give illustrations. First of that स् which is a substitute. It can only be the स् which replaces the ष् of a root in </i>Dhatupatha<i>. Thus सिषेव, सुष्वाप ॥ Of an affix, we have अग्निषु, वायुषु, कर्तृषु, हर्तृषु; वक्षत् in इन्द्रो मा वक्षत्; and यक्षत् in स देवान् यक्षत् ॥

In the case of वक्षत् and यक्षत्, the स् is not the portion of an affix, but the whole affix itself: the present </i>sutra<i> should therefore not apply to this स् ॥

Answer:- Here we apply the maxim व्यपदेशिवद् एकस्मिन् ॥

These words (वक्षत् and यक्षत्) are from the roots वच् and यज्, in लेट् with तिप्, the इ is elided by [[3.4.97]], the augment अट् [[3.4.94]], the affix सिप् by [[3.1.34]]; the च् of वच् is changed to a guttural, and the ज् of यज् to ष् and then to a guttural.

The </i>Unadi<i> word अक्षरं (अश् + सर् </i>Unadi<i> III.70) complies with this rule, but not so the word कूसरं and धूसरं (</i>Unadi_ III.73) formed with the same affix सर ॥
