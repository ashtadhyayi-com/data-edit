ष् is substituted for the स् of 1. शास् 2. वस् 'to dwell' and 3. घस् when it is preceded by an इण् vowel or a guttural.
Thus अन्वशिषत्, अन्वशिषताम्, अन्वशिषन्, the Aorist of शास्; the च्लि is replaced by अङ् [[3.1.56]], and the आ changed to इ by [[6.4.34]]. So also शिष्टः, शिष्टवान् ॥ From वस् we have उषितः, उषितवान्, उषित्वा ॥ The <i>Samprasarana</i> takes place by [[6.1.15]] as it belongs to <i>yajadi</i> class. From घस् we have जक्षतुः, जक्षुः in the Perfect. घस् is the substitute of अद् [[2.4.40]], the penultimate अ is elided by [[6.4.98]]. So also अक्षन् in अक्षन्नमीमदन्त पितरः (<i>Rig</i>. I.82.2). This is the Aorist form of अद्, the घस् is substituted for अद् [[2.4.37]] the Aorist sign is elided by [[2.4.80]].

This <i>sutra</i> is made to cover cases not governed by the last <i>sutra</i>, namely, where the स् is not an <i>adesa</i>. Though the स् in घस् is the स् of a substitute, yet it is not governed by the preceding aphorism, because the word आदेशस्य there means 'the स् which is a substitute'. Here स् is not a substitute, but a portion of a substitute. The non-substitute घस् is not to be taken here : as it seldom occurs.

The word इण्कोः is understood here also. Therefore the rule would not apply to शास्ति, वसति and जघास ॥
