In स्था etc. up to सित् exclusive -- उपसर्गात् सुनोतिसुवतिस्यतिस्तौतिस्तोभतिस्थासेनय सेधसिचसञ्जस्वञ्जाम् [[8.3.65]] to परिनिविभ्यः सेवसितसयसिवुसहसुट्स्तुस्वञ्जाम् [[8.3.70]], this substitution of ष् takes place then also, when the reduplicate intervenes and the स of the reduplicate is also changed to ष।
The words प्राक् सितात् are understood here also. The स्यादि roots are, स्था, सेनय &c in [[8.3.65]] and ending with सेव् in [[8.3.70]]. The <i>sutra</i> consists of two sentences : (1) The षत्व takes place in स्था &c. even when a reduplicate intervenes; (2) The स of the reduplicates of स्था &c. is changed to ष ॥ The first is a <i>vidhi</i> rule, and the second is a <i>niyama</i> rule.

Thus परितष्ठौ where the <i>abhyasa</i> त intervenes. This applies even to roots other than those which have been taught with a ष in the <i>Dhatupatha</i>. As अभिषिषेणयिषति, परिषिषेणयिषति (सेनया अभियातुमिच्छन्ति). This applies moreover to reduplicates which end in अ, as अभितष्ठौ; here the स् would not have been changed to ष (by [[8.3.59]]) as it is not preceded by इ or उ ॥ Another raison d'etre of this <i>sutra</i> is that it prohibits षण् [[8.3.61]]. As अभिषिषिक्षति, परिषिषिक्षति ॥

The word अभ्यासस्य is for the sake of <i>niyama</i>, as we have said above. स of स्था &c. and of no other roots is changed to ष ॥ As अभिसुसूषति from षू प्रेरणे with सन्, the augment is debarred by [[7.2.12]]: the root स् is unchanged by the <i>niyama</i> prohibition of [[8.3.61]]; the reduplicate स् remains unchanged by the restriction of the present <i>sutra</i>.
