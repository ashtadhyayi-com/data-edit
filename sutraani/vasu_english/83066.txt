The  स् of सद् is changed to ष after an उपसर्ग (Preposition) having an इ or उ , but not after प्रति।
The word सदिः is in the first case, but has the force of genitive. Thus निषीदति, विषीदति, न्यषीदत्, व्यषीदत् ॥ निषसाद, विषसाद ॥ The second स remains unchanged in the Perfect by [[8.3.118]].

Why do we say 'but not after प्रति'? Observe प्रतिसीदति ॥ Prof. Bohtlingk points out that the <i>sutra</i> is सदेरप्रतेः as given by <i>Sayanacharya</i> in his commentary on <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i> VI.13. I.<i>Panini</i>, however, often uses the first case with the force of the Genitive, as in [[8.3.80]].
