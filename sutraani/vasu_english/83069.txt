The ष् is substituted for the स् of स्वन् after वि  and अव when the sense is 'to smack while eating'.
Thus विश्वणति, ष्यष्वणत्, विषष्वाण, अवष्वणति, अवाष्वणत्, अवषष्वाण ॥ That is, he makes sound while eating, he eats with a smack.

Why do we say "when making a smacking sound in eating"? Observe विस्वनति मृदङ्गः "the drum sounds".
