The word परिस्कन्द is used without the cerebral change in the country of Eastern Bharata.
This is an anomaly. The ष required by the last <i>sutra</i> is prohibited. The other form is परिष्कन्दः ॥ The word परिस्कन्द is formed by the affix अच् or it is a <i>Nishtha</i>, the त being elided. The word भरत qualifies the word प्राच्य ॥

Prof. Bohtlingk translates it "परिस्कन्द is seen in the usage of the Eastern People and the <i>Bharata</i>". He bases his construction on the <i>sutras</i> [[2.4.66]], and [[4.2.113]], where प्राच्यभरतेषु means "the Eastern People and <i>Bharata</i>".
