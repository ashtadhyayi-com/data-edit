The cerebral sound is substituted in the room of ध् of षीध्वम्  and of the personal-endings of the Aorist and the लिट् (Perfect Tense), after a अङ्ग (stem) ending in इण् (a vowel other than अ).
The word 'cerebral' is understood here from [[8.3.55]]. Thus च्योषीढ्वम्, प्लोषीढ्वम् ॥ Aorist :- अच्योढ्वम्, अप्लोढ्वम् [[8.2.25]]. Perfect : चकृढ्वे ॥

Though the <i>anuvritti</i> of इण्कोः was current here from [[8.3.57]], yet the repetition of the word इण् here indicates that the <i>anuvritti</i> of कु or the guttural ceases. As पक्षीध्वम्, यक्षीध्वम् ॥

Why do we say "the ध of पीध्वं, लुङ् and लिट्"? Observe स्तुध्वे, अस्तुध्वम्, where the ध is of लट् and लङ् ॥

Why do we say अङ्गात् 'after a stem'? Observe परिवेविषीध्वम्, from विष्लृव्याप्तौ of the <i>Juhotyadi</i> class. There is <i>Guna</i> of the reduplicate by [[7.4.75]], the स् of सीयुट् is elided by [[7.2.79]], and षीध्वम् here is made up of the ष् of the root विष्, and ईध्वम् the affix; therefore षीध्वम् here is not after the <i>anga</i> परिवे वि, for the <i>anga</i> here is परिवे विष्, and ईध्वम् is the affix. This result could have been obtained, without using the word अङ्गात् in the <i>sutra</i>, by the maxim अर्थवद् ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य "a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning, denotes that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote a combination void of meaning".
