ष् is substituted for the स् of 1. स्तुत 2. स्तोम  and 3. सोम when preceded by अग्नि in a compound.
Thus अग्निष्टुत्, अग्निष्टोमः, अग्नीषोमः ॥

<i>Ishti</i>:- The इ of अग्नि is lengthened before सोम and it is after such lengthened ई, that the स of सोम is changed to ष, otherwise not. As अग्निसोमौ माणवकौ ॥ So also अग्निसोमौ तिष्ठतः (where '<i>agni</i>' means fire, and '<i>soma</i>' a kind of herb) "the fire and the <i>soma</i> plant are here."

When there is no compounding we have अग्ने सोमः ॥

The word अग्निष्टुत् is formed by क्विप्, the sacrifice in which <i>Agni</i> is praised (स्तूयते) is so called. अग्निष्टोमः is also the name of a sacrifice: the first division (संस्था) of the <i>Soma</i>-<i>yaga</i>. अग्नीषोमः is a देवता-द्वन्द्वः so where there is no <i>Devata</i>-<i>Dvandva</i>, the ष change will not take place. Thus where <i>Agni</i> and <i>Soma</i> are names of two boys, or where they refer to physical fire and herb. According to <i>Asvalayana</i> there is lengthening and ष change in the last case also, as अग्नीषोमौ प्रणेष्यामि ॥
