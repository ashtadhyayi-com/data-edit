The word कपिष्ठल is irregularly formed denoting the founder of a गोत्र (Patronymic) of that name.
Thus the son of <i>Kapishthala</i> will be कापिष्ठलिः ॥ The word "<i> gotra</i>" here does not mean the grammatical "<i>gotra</i>," but the popular term '<i> gotra</i>' denoting 'clans,' as described in the list of <i>pravaras</i>. Why do we say "when denoting the founder of a <i> gotra</i>"? Observe कपिस्थलम् The land of the monkeys.
