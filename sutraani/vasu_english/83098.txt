ष् is substituted for the स् of the words सुषामान् etc.
Thus सुषामा ब्राह्मणः = शोभनम् साम यस्य असौ ॥

1 सुषामा, 2 निःषामा, 3 दुःषामा, 4 सुषेधः, 5 निषेधः (निःषेधः), 6 दुःषेधः, 7 सुषंधिः, 8 निःषंधिः (निषंधिः), 9 दुःषंधिः, 10 सुष्टु (सुष्ठु), 11 दुष्टु (दुष्ठु), 12 गौरिषक्थः संज्ञायाम्, 13 प्रतिष्णिका, 14 जलाषाहम्, 15 नौषेचनम् (नौषेवनम्), 16 दुन्दुभिषेवणम् (दुन्दुभिषेचनम्, षेवनम्) 17 एति संज्ञायामगात्, 18 हरिषेणः, 19 नक्षत्राद्वा, रोहिणीषेणः ॥ आकृतिगण ॥

Some of the above words would have been governed by the prohibition in [[8.3.111]], others would never have taken ष, hence their inclusion in this list. The word सु is here a <i>karmapravachaniya</i> [[1.4.94]] and निर् and दुर् also are not <i>upasargas</i>, because they are so only in connection with the verbs गम and क्री; so [[8.3.65]] does not apply to सेध preceded by निर् and दुर् ॥ The words निःषेधः and दुःषेधः = निर्गतः सेधः or दुर्गतः सेधः ॥ The word सेध here is a घञ् formed word, from षिधू हिंसा संराद्ध्योः; if it be derived from षिध गत्याम्, then also, the word is included here in order to prevent the application of [[8.3.113]]. The words सुषन्धिः, दुःषन्धिः &c are derived from धा with the prepositions सु and सम्, and the affix कि [[3.3.92]]; and the स of सम् is changed to ष् ॥ The words सुष्ठु, दुष्ठु are <i>Unadi</i> formed words (<i>Unadi</i> I.25). The word गौरिषक्थः is a <i>Bahuvrihi</i>, the स of सक्थि is changed to ष् and the <i>Samasanta</i> षच् is added [[5.4.113]]. The long ई of the first member is shortened by [[6.3.63]]. The word प्रतिष्णिका is formed by adding the Preposition प्रति to the root स्ना, and the affix अङ् [[3.3.106]], and we have प्रतिष्णा with टाप्; then क is added by [[5.3.73]], and आ shortened [[7.4.13]], and इ added by [[7.3.44]]. The word नौषेचनं is formed by adding ल्युट् to सिच् ॥ दुन्दुभिषेवणं is also a ल्युट् formed word from सेवति or सीव्यति ॥
