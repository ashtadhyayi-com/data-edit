The स of the verb सन् , when it loses its न् is changed to ष , under the same circumstances.
Thus गोषाः (<i>Rig</i>. IX. 2.10), formed by the affix विट [[3.2.67]], the न् is elided by [[6.4.41]]. So also नृषाः ॥

Why do we say 'when it loses its न्'? Observe गोसनिं वाचमुदीरयन् (<i>Atharvaveda</i> III.20.10). Here the affix is इन् [[3.2.27]]. See however गोषणिं in <i>Rig</i>. VI.53.10.

Though this ष change would have taken place by [[8.3.106]] also, the separate enumeration is for the sake of <i>niyama</i> or restriction. Some however read the word गोसनिः in the list of सवनानि words [[8.3.110]], and they hold that the proper counter-example is सिसानयिषति ॥ So also सिसनीः formed by adding क्विप् to the Derivative root सिसनिस, thus सिसनिस + क्विप् = सिसनिस् (the अ is elided by [[6.4.48]]) + 0. add सु, सिसनिस् + स् = सिसनिस् + 0 [स् is elided by [[6.1.68]]. Now the final स् (of the Desiderative affix सन्) is liable to be changed either to ष् or to र् (रु). The ष being <i>asiddha</i>, the रु change takes place.] = सिसनिर् = सिसनीः (the lengthening is by [[8.2.76]]). Here the Desiderative affix सन् is not changed to ष, hence this word is not governed by [[8.3.61]]. This being the object of this <i>sutra</i>, there will be ष change in शिषाणयिषति in the Causative.
