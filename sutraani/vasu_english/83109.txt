ष् is substituted for the स् of सह after पृतना  and ऋत।
Thus पृतनाषाहम्, ऋताषाहम् ॥ Some divide this <i>sutra</i> into two; as (1) सहेः; (2) पृतनार्त्ताभ्यां च ॥ So that the rule may apply to ऋतीषहः also. The word ऋति is lengthened by [[6.3.116]], in <i>sanhita</i> : and the ष change takes place in <i>sanhita</i> only. Otherwise the form is ऋतिसहम् ॥ The word च 'and' in the <i>sutra</i> includes words other than those not mentioned in it. The word ऋतीषहं would be valid by this also.
