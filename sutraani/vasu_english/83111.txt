The ष् substitution does not take place in the affix सात् and for that स् which stands at the beginning of a word.
Thus सात् here is the affix ordained by [[5.4.52]], and it would have been changed to ष by [[8.3.59]]. The present <i>sutra</i> prevents that. The <i>Padadi</i> स refers to those verbs which in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> are taught with a ष, and for which a स is substituted. This also is an exception to [[8.3.59]]. Thus अग्निसात् । दधिसात् । मधुसात् ॥ So also with <i>Padadi</i> स as दधि सिञ्चति, मधु सिञ्चति ॥
