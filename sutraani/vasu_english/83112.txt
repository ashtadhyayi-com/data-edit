The ष् substitution does not take place in the स् of सिच् of the Intensive.
Thus सेसिच्यते and अभिसेसिच्यते ॥

Question:- The स of the reduplicate should be changed into ष by [[8.3.65]], in अभिसेसिच्यते, and the स of the root should be changed into ष by [[8.3.64]]. Because सिच् is one of the roots taught in [[8.3.65]], and therefore, as this latter rule prevents the operation of [[8.3.111]] i. e. पदादि स so far as it goes, so it would prevent also the operation of this rule and the form ought to be अभिषेषिच्यते ?

Answer:- The ष ordained by [[8.3.65]] prevents only the operation of पदादि स of [[8.3.111]], and the स of this rule. Therefore the present prohibition is of universal application.

Why do we say in the Intensive. Observe अभिषिषिक्षति ॥
