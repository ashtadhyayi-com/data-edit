The ष् substitution does not take place in the स् of the verb सेध when the meaning is that of moving.
Thus अभिसेधयति गाः, परिसेधयति गाः ॥ This is an exception to [[8.3.65]].

Why do we say 'when meaning to drive'? Observe शिष्यमकार्यात्प्रतिषेधयति ॥ Here the sense is that of preventing or prohibiting.
