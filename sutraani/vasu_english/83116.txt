The ष् substitution does not take place in the reduplicated Aorist of the roots 1. स्तम्भ् 2. सिव्  and 3. सह।
The root स्तम्भ required ष change by [[8.3.67]], and the roots सिव and सह by [[8.3.70]]. Thus पर्यतस्तम्भत्, अभ्यतस्तम्भत् ॥ सिव :- पर्यसीषिवत्, न्यसीषिवत् ॥ सह :- पर्यसीषहत्, व्यसीषहत् ॥

Vart:- This prohibition refers to the ष change that is caused by an <i>Upasarga</i> and not to the reduplicate change, as we have illustrated in the above example.
