After र् and ष् , the ण् is the substitute of न् , when they occur as component letters in the same word.
These letters must be parts of the same <i>pada</i> or word, one being the 'occasion' for the application of the rule as regards the other. As आस्तीर्णम्, विस्तीर्णम्, अवगूर्णम् ॥ So also after ष; as कृष्णाति, पुष्णाति, मुष्णाति ॥

The letter ष् is included in this aphorism for the sake of subsequent <i>sutras</i> : for न् will be changed into ण् when preceded by ष् by rule [[8.4.41]] of this Chapter, as well.

Why do we say "when occurring in the same word?" Observe अग्निर्नयति, वायुर्नयति ॥

Vart:- So also after the letters ऋ ॥ As तिसृणाम्, चतसृणाम्, मातॄणाम्, पितॄणाम् ॥
This <i>vartika</i> may well be dispensed with: because the र in the <i>sutra</i> is the common sound र which we perceive both in र and ऋ; and so the र will denote both the vowel ऋ and the consonant र. See contra. [[8.2.42]]. Objection:- But if even this be so, the letter ऋ has three parts, its first part is a vowel, in the middle is the र् sound of a quarter <i>matra</i>, and a vowel sound at the end. This vowel-sound will intervene between the र-sound and the subsequent न, and will prevent the application of the <i>sutra</i>, hence the <i>vartika</i> is valid ?

Answer:- This vowel-sound will be no intervention, because it will be included in the exception अट् of the next <i>sutra</i>. Objection:- The vowel-sound at the end of ऋ is not a full vowel of one <i>matra</i>, but is of half-<i>matra</i>, being only a fragment of ऋ, and hence is not included in the <i>pratyahara</i> अट्, it has no separate स्थान or प्रयत्न or homogeneity with any vowel. Hence this vowel-sound will prevent the application of this rule. Answer:- The ण change, however, does take place in spite of such intervention of a fragment of a letter, as we know from the <i>jnapaka</i> of [[8.4.39]]. In the <i>kshubhnadi</i> list there we find नृनमन as an exception, implying that न is generally changed to ण after such a fragmentary interposition. Or we may take नृनमन as a <i>jnapaka</i>, that after the letter ऋ also the ण change takes place.
