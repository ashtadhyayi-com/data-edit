So also, न् is replaced by ण् , when the letter occasioning the substitution, occurs in the first member of a compound, and the whole compound is a Name, provided that the first member does not end with the letter ग।
As द्रुणसः, वार्द्ध्रीणसः (a kind of antelope), खरणसः, शूर्पणखा ॥ See [[5.4.118]] and [[4.1.58]].

Why do we say "when a Name"? Observe, चर्मनासिकः ॥

Why do we say when 'not ending in the letter ग'? Observe; ऋगयनम् ॥

Some say, that this <i>sutra</i> is a नियम or a restrictive rule, and not a विधि or original enunciation, so that the substitution takes place, only when the word is a Name, and not otherwise. A compound is one word or समानपद, though composed of two or more words or पद ॥ Therefore by [[8.4.11]] the न will always be changed into ण when preceded by र or ष. But the present <i>sutra</i> restricts its scope, to those cases only, when the compound denotes a Name, as not in चर्मनासिका ॥ The word पूर्वपद is a relative term and connotes an उत्तरपद ॥ The present <i>sutra</i> therefore applies to those cases where the र् or ष् is in the पूर्वपद, and न occurs in the उत्तरपद ॥ It therefore, does not apply to तद्धित words, nor when both the letters occur in the पूर्वपद ॥ In the case of a <i>Taddhita</i>, there is a पूर्वपद, but there is no properly speaking उत्तरपद ॥ Thus खरपस्यापत्यं = खारपायणः [[4.1.99]]. Here the affix अयन is equivalent to अपत्यं, and खरप is the <i>Purvapada</i>. But the affix अयन not being a <i>Pada</i>, we cannot call it an <i>uttara</i> <i>pada</i>. Hence न will be changed into ण though खारपायण is not an Appellative but a generic term. So also मातृभोगाय हितः = मातृभोगीणः with ख affix. Similarly in करणप्रियः, the words र and न both occur in the <i>Purvapada</i> and are not affected by this rule, but by the general rule [[8.4.1]]. So also the proviso relating to ग, only prohibits the change of न into ण, but does not prohibit the restrictive character of this <i>sutra</i>.

According to others, this <i>sutra</i> is an original enunciation or a <i>Vidhi</i> rule, and not a <i>Niyama</i> rule. They say that the word समानपद in [[8.4.1]] is equivalent to नित्यं पदं i. e. a word integral and indivisible into component words. In other words, समानपद means, a 'simple-word'. The present <i>sutra</i> therefore enunciates a new rule for a "compound-word". For in a compound or समास, there being a division of पूर्वपद and an उत्तरपद, we cannot say that a compound is a समानपद or indivisible word. Hence this <i>sutra</i> is a विधि ॥

The <i>sutra</i> should be thus divided :- पूर्वपदात् संज्ञायाम् one <i>sutra</i>, and अगः another. So that every rule relating to ण change would be debarred with regard to ग intervention.
