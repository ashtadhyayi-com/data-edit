The न of पान is changed into ण , when occurs as the second member of a compound, the first member of which contains a letter causing change; and the whole compound denotes a country or people.
The word पान is formed by the affix ल्युट् [[3.3.113]]. Thus क्षीरपाणा उशीनराः = क्षीरपाणं येषां 'the milk-drinking <i>Usinaras</i>'. सुरापाणाः प्राच्याः 'the wine-drinking <i>Prachyas</i>'. सौवीरपाणा बाह्लीकाः "the <i>sauvira</i>-drinking <i>Bahlikas</i>". कषायपाणा गान्धाराः &c.

Why do we say "when denoting a country"? Observe दक्षिपानं the drink of the <i>Dakshis</i>.

The words उशीनर and the rest are applied to persons also through the medium of being country-names.
