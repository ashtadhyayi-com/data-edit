In a compound, the second member of which is a monosyllable, there is ण in the room of न of the second member, provided that the न is at the end of a प्रातिपदिक , or is the augment नुम् , or occurs in a विभक्ति; and when the first member contains a cause of change.
Thus वृत्रहणौ and वृत्रहणः 'the <i>Vritra</i>-killer'. क्षीरपाणि 'Drinkers of milk' : सुरापाणि 'drinkers of wine' : being examples of नुम् [[7.3.88]], क्षीरापेण and सुरापेण are examples of case-terminations.

Why the letter ण is repeated in this <i>sutra</i>, while its <i>anuvritti</i> was understood from the context? It is repeated in order to show that this is not an optional rule, but an obligatory rule. In fact, it shows that the <i>anuvritti</i> of वा 'optional' ceases, and does not extend further.
