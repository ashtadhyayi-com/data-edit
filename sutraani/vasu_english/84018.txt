In the remaining verbs, optionally the न of नि is replaced by ण , when it is preceded by an उपसर्ग competent to cause the change; provided that, in the original enunciation, the verb has not an initial क or ख , nor ends with ष।
The words नेः and उपसर्गात् are understood in the <i>sutra</i>. The word शेषे means verbs other than those mentioned last. Thus प्रणिपचति or प्रनिपचति, प्रणिभिनत्ति or प्रनिभिनत्ति ॥

Why do we say अकखादौ "not beginning with क or ख"? Observe प्रनिकरोति, प्रनिखादति ॥ Here there is no change.

Why do we say अषान्तः "not ending in ष"? Observe प्रनिपिनष्टि ॥

Why do we say उपदेशे "in original enunciation"? So that the prohibition may apply to forms like प्रनिचकार, प्रनिचखाद, प्रनिपेक्ष्यति [[8.2.41]]. Here चकार &c, do not begin with क or ख nor does पिष् end with ष् but with क् [[8.2.41]] but in the <i>Dhatupatha</i> the verb कृ and खद् begin with क and ख and पिष् ends with ष्, and hence the rule will not apply. So also in प्रणिवेष्टा and प्रणिवेक्ष्यति from the root विश् ॥ Here though the verb now ends with ष by [[8.2.36]], yet in the original enunciation or <i>Dhatupatha</i>, it ends with श ॥
