The न of अयन is changed to ण , when preceded by the word अन्तर् and the word does not denote a country.
Thus अन्तरयणं शोभनम् ॥ Why do we say "not denoting a country"? Observe अन्तरयनो देशः ॥ This ण change would have taken place by [[8.4.29]], this special <i>sutra</i> is for आदेश purposes. The word अयन is formed by ल्युट् added to अय् or इण् ॥
