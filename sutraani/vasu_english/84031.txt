The कृत् affix, coming after a verb, which begins with a consonant and has a penultimate इच् vowel, changes optionally its न् , which is preceded by a vowel, into ण् , when it comes after उपसर्ग having a cause of change.
The phrase कृत्यचः is understood here. Thus प्रकोपणम् or प्रकोपनम्, परिकोपणम् or परिकोपनम् ॥

Why do we say हलः 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe प्रेहणम् and प्रोहणम् where the change is obligatory, under [[8.4.29]]. These are from ईह चेष्टायाम् and ऊह वितर्के ॥

Why do we say इजुपधात् 'having a penultimate इच् vowel'? Observe प्रवपणम् and परिवपणम्; no option.

By the rule कृत्यचः the change was obligatory, this rule makes it optional.

The न of the <i>krit</i>-affix must come after a vowel, otherwise there will be no change. See परिभुग्नः ॥

The word हलः in the <i>sutra</i> should be interpreted as हलादेः, and not as ordinarily "after what ends in हल्" ॥ For an इजुपधा verb implies that it ends with a consonant, and so the employment of the word हलः in the text would have been useless had it meant हलन्तात् ॥
