A कृत् affix ordained after a verb beginning with an इच् vowel, having the augment नुम् in it, and ending with a consonant, changes it s न् into ण् , when preceded by an उपसर्ग having in it the cause of change.
The word हलः of the last <i>sutra</i> is understood here. But contrary to the construction put upon it in the last <i>sutra</i>, here it means हलन्तात्, by the natural rule of construction as given in [[1.1.72]]. We must interpret it so here, because it is impossible for an इजादि root to commence with a हल्; while to have done so in the last aphorism would have been redundant.

Thus प्रेङ्खणम्, परेङ्खणम् from इखि गत्यर्थः; the नुम् is added because it is इदित् ॥ प्रेङ्गणम्, परेङ्गणम्, प्रोम्भणम् परोम्भणम् ॥ In उम्भ पूरणे the nasal is part of the root. The rule will not apply to प्रेन्वनम्, because नुम् here means the <i>anusvara</i> generally [[8.4.2]] though the change would have been valid by the general rule, [[8.4.29]] this <i>sutra</i> makes a नियम or restriction. That is, only in the case of इजादि सनुम् verbs the change takes place, not in other सनुम् verbs. Thus प्रमङ्गनम्, परिमङ्गनम् from the root मगि सर्पणे ॥

This rule does not affect rule [[8.4.30]], relating to ण्यन्त verbs, for those verbs cannot be said to end with a consonant. Moreover, we have used the word विहितः in explaining the <i>sutra</i>, in order to indicate this fact, that the <i>krit</i>-affix must be ordained after a consonant-ending verb. In the case of causative verbs, the <i>krit</i>-affix is ordained after a vowel-ending (णि) verb, and the vowel is elided after the adding of the affix. So that before the adding of the affix, the verb did not end in a consonant.
