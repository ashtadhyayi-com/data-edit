ण् is not the substitute of the verb नश 'to destroy', when ending in ष्।
When the श् is changed to ष् in नश्, the न of नश् is not changed. Thus प्रनष्टः, परिनष्टः ॥ The नुम् ordained by [[7.1.60]], is elided by [[6.4.24]], and श् changed ष् by [[8.2.36]].

Why do we say षान्तस्य ? Observe प्रणश्यति, परिणश्यति ॥ The word अन्त is taken in order that the prohibition may apply to words like प्रनङ्क्ष्यति, which did end with ष् though the ष has been changed by other rules, and is no longer visible. For here the श् of नश् is changed to ष् by [[8.2.36]], and then this ष् is changed to क् by [[8.2.41]]; and the नुम् is added by [[7.1.60]].
