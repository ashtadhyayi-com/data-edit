There is reduplication of यर् , i.e. all the consonants except ह after the letters र् and ह् following a vowel.
The word यर् of last <i>sutra</i> is understood here. According to others, the वा is also understood, and this is an optional rule. Thus अर्क्कः, मर्क्कः, ब्रह्म्मा, अपह्न्नुते ॥

Why do we say अचः 'following a vowel'? Observe ह्नुते, ह्मलयति ॥
