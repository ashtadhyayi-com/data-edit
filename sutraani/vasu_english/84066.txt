The स्वरित is the substitute of an अनुदात्त vowel which follows an उदात्त vowel.
Thus अग्निम् + ईले = अग्नि॑मीले ॥ Here ई which was अनुदात्त by rule [[8.1.28]], becomes <i>svarita</i> by the present rule, as it comes after the <i>udatta</i> इ of <i>agni</i>.

So also गा꣡र्ग्यः॑, वा꣡त्स्यः॑ ॥ Here यञ् is added by [[4.1.105]], and being ञित् the words are first acute. The final is <i>anudatta</i>, which becomes <i>svarita</i>. So also प꣡च॑ति and प꣡ठ॑ति, the शप् and तिप् are <i>anudatta</i>, the root is accented, the अ of शप् becomes <i>svarita</i>.

The rule [[6.1.158]], does not change this <i>svarita</i> into an <i>Anudatta</i>, because for the purposes of that rule, the present rule is असिद्ध, or as if it had not taken place [[8.2.1]]. Therefore both the <i>udatta</i> and the <i>svarita</i> accent are heard.
