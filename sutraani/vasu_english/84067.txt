All prohibit the above substitution of स्वरित, except the आचार्याः - गार्ग्य, काश्यप and गाल्व; when an उदात्त or a स्वरित follows.
This debars the preceding rule. That <i>anudatta</i> which is followed by an <i>Udatta</i> is उदात्तोदयः or उदात्तपरः ॥ The word उदय means पर in the terminology of ancient Grammarians. That <i>anudatta</i> which is followed by a <i>svarita</i> is called स्वरितोदयः ॥ These are <i>Bahuvrihi</i> compounds. Thus उदात्तोदयः — गा꣡र्ग्यस्त꣡त्र॑, वा꣡त्स्य॒ स्त꣡त्र॑ ॥ The word त꣡त्र is first acute by लित् accent, before this <i>udatta</i>, the य of these words does not become <i>svarita</i>. So with स्वरितोदयः — गा꣡र्ग्यः॒॑ क्व॑ वा꣡त्स्यः॒॑ क्व॑ ॥ The word क्व is <i>svarita</i> being formed by the तित् affix अत् [[5.3.12]]; before this <i>svarita</i> the preceding य does not become <i>svarita</i>.

Why do we say, "except in the opinion of <i>Gargya</i>, <i>Kasyapa</i> and <i>Galava</i>"? Observe गार्ग्यः॑ क्व॑, गा꣡र्ग्य॑स्तत्र ॥ According to their opinion, the <i>svarita</i> change does take place.

The employment of the longer word उदय instead of the shorter word पर is for the sake of auspiciousness, for the Book has approached the end. The very utterance of the word उदय is auspicious. All sacred works commence with an auspicious word, have an auspicious word in the middle, and end with an auspicious word. Thus <i>Panini</i> commences his <i>sutra</i> with the auspicious word वृद्धि 'increase' in <i>Sutra</i> [[1.1.1]]: has the word शिव 'the well-wisher' in the middle [[4.4.143]], and उदय at the end.

The mention of the names of those several <i>Acharyas</i> is for the sake of showing respect (<i>pujartham</i>).
